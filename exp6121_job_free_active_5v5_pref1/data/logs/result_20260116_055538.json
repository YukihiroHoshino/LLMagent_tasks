If that’s taken, I can do 2) Tomorrow 3:30–3:50 ET.\n\nPre-screen bullets:\n- Stakeholder group size/shape: 4 core teams (Ops, Product, Engineering, Support/CS) plus 2–3 key internal requester groups; I ran the weekly exec/stakeholder sync with an Ops lead as the primary sponsor and periodic visibility from a senior leader (VP-level) for escalations.\n- Conflict/tradeoff example: A late request added scope that would have pushed a key milestone by ~2 weeks. I led a tradeoff review: split the work into “must-have for deadline” vs “phase 2,” reduced non-critical requirements, and added a clear change-control rule (any new scope required swapping out equivalent effort). Result: we hit the original date with no quality regressions and delivered the deferred items in the next sprint.\n- Reporting comfort: very comfortable with spreadsheets (pivots, formulas), building lightweight dashboards/weekly KPI reporting, and basic SQL (selects/joins/filters/aggregations) as needed to validate metrics.\n\nIf you confirm the slot, I’ll be there and can move quickly on next steps.",

If an aligned req opens/reopens with a valid link/ID, I’ll message you with the exact link/ID immediately so you can apply under the correct posting using **seeker.e@example.com**.\n\nI appreciate how organized and responsive you’ve been throughout.",

However, it is round 30 and there are no other candidates in the inbox, and we have no open/reopened requisition or routable intake to convert a TALK into an APPLY/ACCEPT match. The seeker has not applied this round, so we cannot accept. Best action is to confirm no change and reiterate the only path (keep packet on file and notify if a req opens)."
