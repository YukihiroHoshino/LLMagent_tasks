However, given the late round (9/30) and no evidence that higher-ranked seekers are engaging with Company_E (most seekers rank Company_E last except Seeker_E who ranks Company_E first), the probability of receiving Seeker_A–D applications to Company_E is low. Additionally, we already indicated strong alignment and encouraged applying; rejecting now would be inconsistent and could harm outcomes. Therefore accept Seeker_E."
