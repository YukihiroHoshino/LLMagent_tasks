I wrote the new spec template, trained partner teams, and led rollout + iteration.\n\n3) Measurable impact (baseline → result):\n- Cycle time: ~6.5 weeks avg → ~4.5 weeks (≈31% faster)\n- Rework rate (late-stage requirement changes): ~22% → ~10% (≈55% reduction)\n- On-time delivery: ~68% → ~86% (+18 pts)\n\n4) What I’d do differently: I’d instrument success metrics earlier (week 1) and pilot with one partner team for 2 weeks before scaling, to reduce initial adoption friction.\n\nIf helpful, I can send this as a formatted 1-page PDF plus 1–2 references within a few hours.

I was the DRI for the process redesign and rollout (responsible for diagnosis, proposal, implementation, and iteration). I secured leadership buy-in at kickoff via a short readout (problem statement, baseline metrics, proposed operating model, and success metrics) and then ran weekly check-ins with lightweight exec visibility.\n\n2) Most contested metric + validation: The most contested metric was “cycle time” because different teams defined start/end points differently. I standardized the definition (intake accepted → launch) and validated using system-of-record timestamps (ticketing/tool workflow logs) over an 8-week baseline window vs. an 8-week post-rollout window. I cross-checked a sample manually with delivery notes to ensure the timestamps matched reality and excluded outliers that were explicitly paused for external dependencies.\n\nIf you share your preferred format, I’ll send the PDF and references immediately.
