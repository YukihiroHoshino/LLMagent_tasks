If we’re still unfilled after that, we would reopen conversations quickly.\n\nTo make that easier, two quick items would help me calibrate fit and move fast if/when we re-engage: (1) what tech stack/tools you used in those two projects (languages, infra, monitoring), and (2) one concrete reliability/performance metric you improved (e.g., latency, error rate, throughput) and by how much.

To make it easy to move fast if/when you pivot, could you confirm what the exact trigger is for you to re-open the seat to me (e.g., if your top candidates don’t accept by a specific round), and when you’d like me to re-submit an [APPLY]?\n\nI’m still ready to move immediately: I can do the 45‑min technical screen on short notice next week and can start ~2 weeks from confirmation.
