Continuing to stall risks ending unmatched by round 30; also Seeker_D ranks Company_D as #1 and has repeatedly signaled immediate commitment, reducing acceptance risk. Given quota=1 and no higher-ranked applicants currently engaging, accept now to secure a match rather than gamble on higher-ranked seekers who prefer other companies and may never apply to Company_D."
