In round 1, only Seeker_E applied; higher-priority seekers (A-D) are likely to pursue their top choices first and may not reach us. However, accepting Seeker_E now would lock our only slot and prevent matching with any higher-priority seeker if they apply later. Since we can reject now and potentially receive better applicants in later rounds (and we prefer unfilled over outside-list only, but Seeker_E is on-list), the strategic move to maximize our outcome is to wait by rejecting this early low-priority application."

However, in round 1 only Seeker_D applied, and Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their #1, making acceptance likely to stick immediately. Waiting could, in theory, yield a higher-ranked seeker, but Seeker_A prefers B over D, Seeker_B prefers A/C/B/E over D (D last), and Seeker_C prefers C/B/A over D; none are likely to apply to Company_D early. Given quota=1 and strong likelihood of securing a match now versus low probability of attracting higher-priority candidates, accept Seeker_D."
