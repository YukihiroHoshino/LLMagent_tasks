Because our quota is 1, accepting Seeker_C now could prevent us from matching with higher-priority Seeker_B if they become available.

Our true priority list includes Seeker_E (rank 5), so hiring them is preferable to leaving the seat unfilled if no higher-ranked seekers are currently attainable. History shows Seeker_E strongly prefers Company_E (#1) and will accept immediately, eliminating acceptance risk. Other companies share identical priorities, and other seekers generally rank Company_E last, so waiting for Seeker_A–D is unlikely. Accepting now secures a match within quota and avoids ending unmatched."
