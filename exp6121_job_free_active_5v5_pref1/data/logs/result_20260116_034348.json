I did own operational aspects at the DAG level: SLAs, retries/backoff, alert routing, backfill procedures, performance tuning within tasks, and on-call runbooks.\n- I partnered with the platform owner on a couple of ops items (e.g., upgrading providers, adjusting worker resources / concurrency limits, and investigating scheduler/executor bottlenecks), but I did not solely own the full Airflow deployment lifecycle.\n\nI can send the requested 1-page PDF (diagram + 6–10 bullets mapping sources → S3 → Airflow → warehouse → dashboard + where DQ gates/alerts sit) today—would you prefer I paste it inline here as well, or just provide the PDF text/structure for easy internal sharing?

Action: hard-fail DQ gate, block publish, page on-call, immediate Slack update w/ impact + ETA.\n- Ship with caveats (P2): issue is bounded/quantified and can be clearly labeled (e.g., partial late-arriving for a non-critical segment) with a planned reconciliation window. Action: publish with explicit annotation, schedule auto-reconcile/backfill, non-paging alert + stakeholder note.\n- Always: prefer correctness over freshness when error is unbounded or silently changes metric definitions.\n\nPaging/alert criteria (example)\n- Page: SLA miss likely (>60 min hourly or daily gold at risk), or DQ failure on tier-1 metrics/tables, or schema drift affecting core facts.\n- Non-page: minor DQ anomalies on non-critical tables, transient extract flakiness that’s retrying within SLA, or known late-arrival within expected window.\n\nRate-limit/backfill without jeopardizing current-hour SLA\n- Separate pools/queues: “realtime/hourly” pool has priority; “backfill” pool capped (e.g., 1–2 concurrent heavy warehouse tasks).\n- Concurrency controls: task-level limits + warehouse WLM/queues; throttle backfill when current-hour lag increases.\n- Windowing: backfill in small date/key batches; stop/park backfill automatically if SLA risk is detected.\n- Prefer partition overwrite for partition-scoped backfills; otherwise key-scoped deletes to avoid large delete storms.\n\nIf you want me to tailor any of the above to your exact incident severity taxonomy or WLM setup, tell me and I’ll align before Tuesday.",

I’ll be ready to clarify both items on Tuesday; quick answers here as well so you have them in advance:\n\n1) Default for |delta| threshold (fixed % vs 3σ):\n- My default is a **fixed % threshold per source/metric tier**, because it’s simpler to reason about operationally and avoids noisy variance when volumes are low.\n- I use **3σ (or similar statistical bands)** only for high-volume metrics where we have stable seasonality and enough history to make it reliable.\n- How I set it: start with historical backfill/reconciliation runs to measure normal variance by source + hour-of-day/day-of-week, then choose (a) a conservative fixed % for Tier-1 KPIs (e.g., 0.5–1%), and (b) wider bands for noisier sources/low-volume metrics, with periodic review to reduce alert fatigue.\n\n2) When holding at the pre-load DQ gate (and approaching the 60-min SLA):\n- I’d do **multi-channel comms**: (a) Slack incident channel updates per cadence, plus (b) a **dashboard banner/status note** for impacted dashboards/KPIs so downstream users aren’t dependent on Slack visibility.\n- The banner would be explicit: impacted window/source, whether data is delayed vs potentially incorrect, and the current ETA/confidence.\n- If we’re nearing the 60-min SLA, I’d also send a targeted ping to key stakeholder channels/owners (for the most business-critical dashboards) with the same bounded impact + ETA.\n\nI remain on standby to move quickly if your trigger occurs to reopen evaluation after the deep-dive—if that happens, I can accommodate next steps within 24–48 hours.\n\n[TALK]",
