Per your suggestion, I’m sharing a concise 1–2 page-style write-up (compressed here) showing end-to-end ownership, tradeoffs, outcomes, and what I’d do differently.\n\nWORK SAMPLE (end-to-end ownership)\nProject: Reduce onboarding drop-off for a B2B SaaS activation flow\nContext/Goal: Activation within 7 days was under target; sales reported prospects stalling during setup. Goal: increase 7-day activation rate and reduce time-to-first-value.\nMy Role/Ownership: DRI from problem framing → instrumentation → solution design → execution coordination → launch → measurement. Worked with 1 designer + 2 engineers; I owned scope, sequencing, and success metrics.\n\n1) Problem framing & domain alignment\n- Collected evidence: funnel analysis + 8 customer calls + support ticket clustering.\n- Key finding: drop-off concentrated at “integration/config” step; users lacked confidence they’d configured correctly.\n\n2) Decisions & tradeoffs\n- Option A: Full guided wizard with automation (higher impact, 6–8 weeks).\n- Option B: Lightweight “setup checklist + validation + sample data” (moderate impact, 2–3 weeks).\nDecision: Chose Option B to hit near-term targets and de-risk; designed it to be extensible toward Option A later.\n\n3) Execution (owning ambiguity)\n- Defined success metrics: activation rate (+X%), median time-to-first-value (down), and support tickets per new account (down).\n- Added missing instrumentation events and a single-source dashboard.\n- Shipped: checklist UI, inline validation, and “test connection” with clear error states; added sample data to demonstrate success.\n\n4) Outcomes (measurable)\n- 7-day activation rate improved from 34% → 46% over 4 weeks post-launch.\n- Median time-to-first-value reduced by ~28%.\n- Setup-related support tickets per new account decreased by ~22%.\n\n5) What I’d do differently\n- Run an earlier A/B test on messaging + error copy (we iterated post-launch).\n- Add a stronger feedback loop for sales/CS to flag edge cases before release.\n- If resourced, follow with automation (Option A) for the remaining long-tail integrations.\n\nIf this addresses the gaps you mentioned (directly relevant problem, end-to-end delivery, and operating at an ownership/ambiguity level), I’d love to move forward immediately.
