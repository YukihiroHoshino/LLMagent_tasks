Seeker_A prefers Company_B then Company_A, so may not apply to us early; Seeker_B ranks Company_A first but Company_C second and could come to us if not accepted by A. With only round 1 and quota 1, accepting Seeker_C now risks missing a higher-priority candidate later. Rejecting could lose Seeker_C to others, but Seeker_C’s own preferences put us first, so they may re-apply or wait.

We also tracked p75 which moved from 14 days → 10.5 days.\n\n3) Adoption/usage metric(s) that moved and by how much\n- Primary: weekly active users completing the workflow at least once (WAU-completers): +18% vs. baseline by week 6.\n- Secondary: completion rate (started → completed): +9 percentage points (from 61% → 70%).\n- Guardrail: error/rework rate stayed flat (no statistically meaningful increase).\n\n4) One hard trade-off (what I deprioritized and why)\n- We deprioritized a “power-user” advanced configuration feature that a small segment requested, because it would have delayed launch by ~3–4 weeks and didn’t address the largest drop-off point.\n- Instead, we shipped a simpler guided flow + better defaults + instrumentation first, then planned the advanced feature as a follow-on if the core funnel improved (which it did).\n\nGiven this scope and measurement, do you feel this is consistent with what you need for the opening—and are we ready to move to an application decision stage for this role/track?",
