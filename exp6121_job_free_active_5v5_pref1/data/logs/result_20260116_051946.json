Seeker_A’s top choice is Company_B (not Company_A), so waiting risks ending unmatched or accepting a lower-ranked candidate later. Seeker_B ranks Company_A as #1, so acceptance is likely stable and immediate. Given the objective to secure the highest-ranked feasible match within quota under uncertainty, accept Seeker_B now rather than hold out for Seeker_A who may never apply."

However, Seeker_E is the only applicant this round and explicitly has Company_E as top choice, making acceptance likely to secure a match immediately. Waiting could yield higher-priority seekers (A-D), but their preferences place Company_E last, so they are unlikely to apply soon (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Given the low probability of attracting a higher-ranked candidate and the benefit of filling the role now with an eager candidate on our list, accept Seeker_E."

However, Seeker_A prefers Company_B then Company_A then Company_C, and Seeker_B prefers Company_A then Company_C, so there is a meaningful chance that either Seeker_A or Seeker_B may apply to me in a later round if they are rejected or not accepted by their top choices. Accepting Seeker_C now would fill my only slot and prevent matching with a higher-priority candidate. Since the process only allows [ACCEPT]/[REJECT] on an [APPLY] (no holding), the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to reject Seeker_C now and wait for higher-ranked seekers, accepting the risk of ending unmatched."

While Seeker_B is also highly ranked, there is no indication they are applying to Company_B this round (their preference ranks Company_B third). Delaying risks losing Seeker_A to another company (Company_B is Seeker_A’s top choice, but other companies share the same priority ordering and could accept if approached). Therefore, accept now to lock in the best match."

With quota 1 and no competing higher-priority applicants in the inbox this round, accepting Seeker_C secures a match now rather than risking remaining unmatched while waiting for Seeker_A/Seeker_B (who may prefer other companies and may not apply). Prior rejection was strategic, but given current market signal (only Seeker_C applying), the best move to fill the role is to accept."
