              "message": "Hi Seeker_E—thank you for the detailed example and the week-by-week plan. This directly matches the reconsideration path I outlined (clear ownership, stakeholder cadence, concrete day-30 milestone, and evidence you’ve shipped under a 4-week timeline).\n\nWe’d like to move forward and make you an offer for the opening. [ACCEPT]\n\nFor the “first project” you’d own: we need you to stand up and deliver the first milestone of a cross-functional execution workflow (intake → prioritization → weekly operating cadence → visible status tracking) for high-priority requests, with a shipped/usable v1 by day 30.\n\nIf you confirm you’re still ready to commit to Company_E, we’ll send the formal details and start date options immediately.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_E is in the inbox this round. Our true priority list ranks Seeker_E lowest, and we previously rejected them twice, signaling we were holding out for higher-ranked seekers (A–D). However, after 5 rounds no other seekers have approached us; Seeker_E has demonstrated strong commitment (we are their #1) and provided a concrete, credible example and 30-day plan matching the stated reconsideration criteria. Given the risk of ending unmatched and that Seeker_E meets the explicit bar we set, accepting now maximizes the chance to fill the role with an adequate candidate rather than remain unfilled."
