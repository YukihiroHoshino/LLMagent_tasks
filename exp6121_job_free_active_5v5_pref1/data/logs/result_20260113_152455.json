Seeker_C ranks us 1st, so accepting now secures a solid match but may forgo a higher-priority candidate. Given no other inbound applications and uncertainty that A or B will come, but since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, it's worth waiting one or more rounds to try for Seeker_A/Seeker_B; we can reject now and potentially accept Seeker_C later if still available."
