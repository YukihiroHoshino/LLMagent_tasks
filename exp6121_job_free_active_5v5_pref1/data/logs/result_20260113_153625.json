Result: fewer last-minute escalations and a clear single-threaded owner model that the team reused for subsequent launches.\n• Workflow/process improvement: Created lightweight intake + prioritization + QA handoff docs/checklists for recurring work. Result: reduced rework and made cycle time more consistent (fewer back-and-forth loops; smoother handoffs).\n• Stakeholder communication/spec clarity: Wrote concise specs/decision logs and ran alignment sessions to resolve ambiguity early. Result: stakeholders stayed aligned, fewer scope surprises, and faster execution once work started.\n\n3) Preferred engagement structure (if there’s a short-term gap)\n• Best: 4–6 week paid trial (immediate start) with a clear deliverable and success metrics.\n• Also open to: 3-month contract or full-time if there’s a strong fit.\n\nIf helpful, I can tailor the examples to the exact type of gap you anticipate (e.g., launch coordination, backlog triage, process cleanup, partner comms).

Outcome: shipped on the revised date (previously slipping by ~2–3 weeks), cut open risks from ~15 to ~3 by launch week, and reduced escalations (from multiple ad-hoc pings per week to a single structured escalation path).\n• Intake/handoff cleanup: Implemented an intake + prioritization rubric and QA/handoff checklist for a recurring pipeline (team of ~6). Over ~8 weeks, reduced back-and-forth rework loops by ~25–35% (tracked via fewer “returned for clarification” items) and improved on-time delivery from ~70% to ~85% (directional).\n\n2) Preferred operating cadence/tools + external comms\n• Cadence: weekly exec readout (1-pager: progress, decisions needed, top risks), plus 2x/week working sync during critical phases; daily async updates during launch week.\n• Tools: RAID log in Sheets/Notion; Jira for task tracking; simple Gantt/milestone view when helpful; decision log + comms templates in Notion/Docs.\n• External/partner comms: yes—have owned partner-facing status updates, timelines, and change notifications; I keep a single source-of-truth doc + clear “what changed / impact / next steps” messaging.\n\nIf the gap gets confirmed, I’m ready to start immediately on a 4–6 week trial with a clear deliverable (e.g., launch plan + comms cadence + intake/handoff workflow) and success metrics.",
