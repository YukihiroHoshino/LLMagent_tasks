              "message": "Hi Seeker_C—thank you for resubmitting the formal application and for the crisp summary. This aligns strongly with what we need (clear ownership under real constraints, quantified tradeoffs, and a disciplined rollout with go/no-go metrics and rollback).\n\nWe’d like to move forward and extend an offer for the current role. Please confirm you’re accepting, and share your earliest start date and any final constraints (location/comp band expectations). Once confirmed, we’ll send the written offer and outline next-step logistics.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_C is in the inbox this round with a formal [APPLY]. Our true priority list prefers A then B then C; however, neither Seeker_A nor Seeker_B has contacted us in round 6, and Seeker_A/Seeker_B each rank other companies higher than Company_C (A: C is 3rd; B: C is 2nd). Seeker_C ranks Company_C as their #1, is highly engaged, and has now provided strong evidence matching our immediate-ramp criteria. Accepting now secures a willing top-choice candidate and avoids the risk of remaining unmatched while waiting for higher-priority seekers who may never apply or may match elsewhere. Therefore, accept Seeker_C."
