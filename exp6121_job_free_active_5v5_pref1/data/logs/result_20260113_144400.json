I set the operating model (SLA + definitions of “done”), ran weekly planning/review, owned prioritization tradeoffs, and handled escalations. Results: cycle time reduced ~25–30% over two quarters; on-time delivery improved from ~70% to ~90%+; rework/defects down ~20% after implementing QA gates.\n\n2) Built and operated the system in a similar ambiguity/high-velocity environment: Starting from a messy, ad-hoc process, I designed the end-to-end workflow, created the templates/checklists, instrumented metrics (throughput, aging, failure reasons), and trained stakeholders. I continued to run it as the operator (not just the designer) for multiple months, including hiring/onboarding a backfill and documenting the playbook.\n\nIf the opening’s needs shift even slightly toward someone who has operated the core function (not just improved adjacent processes), I’d appreciate being reconsidered—I can make time immediately for a quick screen and walk through these in detail.\n\nThanks again,\nSeeker_E",

Answering your two calibration items as concisely as I can:\n\n1) Scale/volume + tools/systems\n• Volume: ~40–60 inbound requests/week (peaks ~80/week during launches), with a typical active queue of ~80–120 items.\n• Stakeholders/teams: 6–8 recurring stakeholder teams; ~15–25 frequent requesters; weekly review with ~8–12 attendees.\n• Tools: Jira (intake/triage, prioritization, status + SLAs), Confluence (playbooks/templates), Google Sheets (capacity + aging/throughput reporting), Looker/Data Studio dashboards (cycle time, on-time %, defect/rework rate), Slack (escalations + comms). I administered the workflows/fields and maintained the reporting.\n\n2) Closest analogue to your “core function” + what I owned vs shared\n• Closest analogue deliverable: a recurring, SLA-bound “request-to-delivery” operational program where each request resulted in a completed, QA’d deliverable shipped to the requester (with sign-off) on a predictable cadence.\n• My direct responsibility (end-to-end): intake/validation, prioritization decisions and tradeoffs, assignment/capacity planning, running weekly planning/review, execution oversight, QA gates, stakeholder comms/escalations, and final delivery/sign-off tracking. I also owned the operating model (definitions of done, SLAs, templates, metrics) and continuous improvement.\n• Shared: execution work was sometimes performed by partner teams/ICs, but I remained the single DRI for outcomes/timelines/quality and handled cross-team dependencies and unblockers.\n\nIf helpful, I can map this 1:1 to your core function in a 15-minute screen and walk through the workflow + metrics live.\n\nThanks again,\nSeeker_E",

Answering the two final calibration questions below.\n\n1) Typical turnaround/SLA + top failure modes\n• SLA / turnaround: We operated a tiered SLA model. “Standard” requests targeted 5 business days; “expedite” requests were 24–48 hours (used sparingly with explicit tradeoffs); larger/complex items were planned to 10 business days with interim checkpoints.\n• Cycle time (typical): Median end-to-end cycle time for standard items was ~4–5 business days; p75 ~7 business days. For expedites, median was ~1–2 business days.\n• Hard deadlines: Yes—launch dates and exec/stakeholder review windows were the main immovable deadlines; we managed these via a weekly cut line plus explicit expedite criteria.\n• Top failure modes:\n  1) Upstream ambiguity / incomplete intake (missing requirements, shifting scope mid-stream) → rework and QA churn. Fix: tighter intake checklist + “definition of done” + early alignment checkpoint.\n  2) Cross-team dependency slippage / capacity spikes (partner team turnaround or sudden launch-driven volume) → queue aging and missed dates. Fix: explicit dependency owners/dates, capacity buffers, and an expedite gate with tradeoff decisions documented.\n\n2) Availability + constraints\n• Start date: I can start immediately (within 1–2zies) or on a specific date if you prefer—no notice-period constraints.\n• Location/time zone: Flexible; I can work core hours aligned to your team (I’m able to overlap substantially with US time zones).\n• Comp: Flexible and happy to align to your established band for this role; no special constraints.\n\nIf helpful, I can do a 15-minute screen this round and walk through the SLA model, intake gates, and metrics in detail.\n\nThanks again,\nSeeker_E",

Confirmed for tomorrow **11:00–11:15 AM ET**.\n\nPer your request, here’s a brief concrete example of an expedite that forced tradeoffs (I can go deeper live):\n\n**Situation:** A customer-facing team flagged a time-sensitive request tied to a launch/exec review window; it needed delivery in **48 hours** (normally a 5-business-day standard item).\n\n**Tradeoff decision:** I approved it as an **expedite** with the stakeholder approver explicitly acknowledging what would slip. I **de-prioritized two standard requests** that were mid-queue (both low external impact) by pushing their committed dates by **2 business days**, and I paused one non-critical “nice-to-have” enhancement that was in progress (moved it back into backlog).\n\n**How I communicated:** Within ~30 minutes of expedite approval, I posted a short decision note in the shared channel + updated Jira: (1) why the expedite qualified, (2) what was being de-scoped/slipped (with new dates), (3) who approved, and (4) the risk/mitigation plan. I also sent direct pings to the impacted requesters with the new commitments and offered a quick 5-minute sync if needed.\n\n**Outcome:** Expedite delivered on time with QA/sign-off; both slipped standard items still landed within the revised dates, and the decision log reduced follow-up churn because the tradeoff was explicit and pre-approved.\n\nLooking forward to speaking tomorrow.\nSeeker_E",

Since no higher-priority seekers are currently engaging us and time is limited (round 22), continuing the process with Seeker_E preserves the option to fill the role while not committing prematurely. They have not applied this round, so we respond with [TALK] and keep the screen plan intact."
