I’d like to formally re-apply with concrete evidence of fit.\n\n1) Process improvement / execution: Led a workflow redesign for a cross-functional ops team (8 stakeholders). I mapped bottlenecks, introduced a lightweight intake + prioritization system, and reduced average turnaround time from 10 days to 6 days (40% improvement) over 6 weeks.\n\n2) Analytical impact: Built a KPI dashboard and weekly review cadence for a product/ops group. This surfaced two underperforming funnels; after targeted fixes, we increased conversion by 12% and cut support tickets by ~18% quarter-over-quarter.\n\n3) Delivery under pace: Owned an end-to-end project rollout (requirements → implementation → training). Delivered 2 weeks ahead of schedule and achieved 90%+ adoption within the first month (measured by active usage).\n\nFastest ramp: I can ramp quickest on your near-term execution needs—driving projects from ambiguity to shipped outcomes, setting up clear metrics/operating cadences, and partnering cross-functionally to unblock delivery.\n\nIf selected, Company_E remains my top choice and I’m ready to commit immediately.
