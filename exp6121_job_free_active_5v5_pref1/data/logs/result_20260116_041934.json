In round 1, only Seeker_E applied to us, and they rank Company_E as their top choice, meaning acceptance yields an immediate stable match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched. Although we would prefer higher-ranked seekers (A-D), none have contacted us and their preferences place Company_E last, making it unlikely they will apply later. Therefore, accepting Seeker_E maximizes expected outcome versus holding out."

Since all companies share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I am not highly ranked, so I should apply immediately to my top choice rather than risk losing it while talking. A direct, committed application maximizes my chance of securing Company_D before capacities fill."

However, Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their top choice, making acceptance likely to finalize a match immediately. Given no higher-ranked candidates are currently in the inbox and delaying risks ending unmatched or losing Seeker_D to other firms (though D’s top is us), accepting now secures a valid candidate on our list within quota."

However, Seeker_C has applied to us as their #1 choice, making acceptance likely to secure a strong, stable match immediately. With quota 1 and no other inbound applicants this round, rejecting risks losing a guaranteed match and ending up with a lower-ranked or no candidate later if Seeker_A/Seeker_B match elsewhere (they prefer other companies above us). Given market preferences, Seeker_A prefers B and A over us; Seeker_B prefers A over us; both may be captured by Company_A/Company_B. Accepting Seeker_C now is the safest way to fill the role with an included, reasonably high-ranked candidate."

If we reject to wait for Seeker_A, we risk losing Seeker_B and still may not receive Seeker_A (Seeker_A prefers Company_B over us).
