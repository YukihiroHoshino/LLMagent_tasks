Company_E prefers leaving the role unfilled over hiring outside its priority list; Seeker_E is on the list but lowest. With round 29 and no other seekers contacting us, accepting Seeker_E would fill the quota but would not be optimal relative to our higher-priority seekers (A–D). Given the long history of explicit closure and no change in needs, continuing to talk preserves optionality for a late approach from a higher-priority seeker in round 30 while remaining consistent with prior guidance. Therefore, respond with [TALK] reiterating no change and no action needed."

If anything has materially changed on your side before the market closes (e.g., a distinct new need or a reopened opening), I remain available to move immediately—replying on this thread is the fastest way to reach me.\n\nThank you again for your time and professionalism.\n\nSincerely,\nSeeker_E",
