Answers below (concise) + I can share a 1-page summary/anonymized artifacts.\n\n1) Baseline volume + validating lift wasn’t seasonality/concurrent change\n• Baseline volume: ~1.8–2.4k onboarding starts/week (varied by channel mix); completion rate baseline was ~52–55%.\n• Validation approach: (a) Compared 2 weeks pre vs. 2 weeks post with the same acquisition channels segmented (paid/organic/partner) to control for mix shifts; lift held across the largest segments. (b) Checked YoY same-period trend (where available) and saw no comparable jump historically.\n• Guardrails: Monitored leading indicators (step-level drop-off, error rate at the failure state we removed) that directly mapped to the shipped changes; the biggest improvement concentrated exactly at the simplified decision step + the removed failure state.\n• Concurrent changes: Confirmed with Eng/Marketing there were no other releases touching that flow during the measurement window; we also annotated the dashboard with deploy dates to avoid misattribution.\n\n2) Hardest trade-off + handling initial disagreement\n• Hardest trade-off: Cutting 2 “nice-to-have” feature components (requested by GTM) to protect the stability sprint and still hit the external date with an MVP.\n• Initial disagreement: The GTM stakeholder felt the reduced scope weakened the announcement.\n• What I did: Brought a quantified options table (timeline, incident-risk, customer impact, comms impact) and proposed a mitigation plan: (a) position the MVP as “Phase 1” with a dated Phase 2 commitment, (b) add a lightweight workaround/process for the missing component, and (c) include reliability improvements as a customer-facing benefit.\n• Result: They agreed once the decision was framed as protecting the deadline *and* reducing the risk of a high-visibility incident; we documented it in a decision log and set a check-in milestone for Phase 2.\n\nArtifacts: I can share an anonymized 1-page case-study summary + a redacted dashboard layout (metrics + annotation pattern) and a decision-log template.

I’m prepared for the two scenario prompts; sharing concise outlines below so we can use the call for discussion.\n\n1) If the primary KPI is noisy/lagging in week 2: leading indicators + instrumentation\n• Start with a KPI “tree”: decompose the lagging KPI into controllable inputs (volume → activation → engagement → success/retention), then pick 2–4 leading indicators that are (a) closer to user actions, (b) sensitive to change, and (c) plausibly causal.\n• Typical leading indicators I’d consider (depending on your product):\n  - Activation: % reaching key “aha” milestone, time-to-first-value, step-level completion rates.\n  - Quality/reliability: error rate at critical steps, latency, failure-state frequency, support contact rate per active user.\n  - Engagement: WAU/DAU of key feature, repeat usage within 7 days, cohort-based retention early curves.\n• Instrumentation approach:\n  - Define event taxonomy + metric definitions (single source of truth): event names, properties, user/session IDs, and success criteria.\n  - Add step-level funnel events around the “aha” path; include reason codes for drop-offs/failures.\n  - Create a lightweight dashboard with: leading indicators, segment cuts (channel, plan, persona), and release/experiment annotations.\n  - Validate data quality: spot-check event firing, dedupe, missingness, and consistency across clients; add monitoring alerts for event volume anomalies.\n  - Where possible, run a small holdout/A-B or staggered rollout to reduce noise and isolate impact.\n\n2) If two senior stakeholders disagree on priority order: decision framework + documentation\n• Use a structured prioritization rubric that makes trade-offs explicit (and is agreed upfront):\n  - RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or a Value vs. Effort score, plus a “risk/reliability” modifier where applicable.\n  - If it’s strategic vs. operational, I’ll map to company goals/OKRs and quantify downside risk (SLA/customer churn/incident cost) vs. upside (revenue/adoption).\n• Process to break the tie:\n  - Align on the decision owner + decision deadline.\n  - Present 2–3 options with quantified impact, dependencies, and what gets de-scoped.\n  - If still tied, propose a time-boxed spike/experiment to increase confidence, or a staged plan (MVP now + committed follow-up date).\n• Documentation:\n  - Decision log entry: context, options considered, scoring/inputs, final decision + rationale, owner, follow-up checkpoint, and what would trigger revisiting.\n  - Communicate in a short written recap to prevent re-litigation.\n\nSee you tomorrow at 1:30–1:50 on Meet.\n—Seeker_C",
