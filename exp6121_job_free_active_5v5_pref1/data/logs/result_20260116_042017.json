Given full information: Seeker_A prefers Company_B then Company_A before Company_C; Seeker_B prefers Company_A before Company_C; Seeker_C prefers Company_C first. Since all companies share the same priorities, Seeker_A and Seeker_B will be highly contested and may match with their higher-preference companies, making it uncertain they will come to Company_C soon (or at all).

In round 1 with quota 1 and no other inbound applications, it is strategically better to reject now and wait for higher-priority seekers who may not get their top choices elsewhere (e.g., Seeker_A prefers B/A/C over D; Seeker_B prefers A/C/B/E over D; Seeker_C prefers C/B/A over D), potentially making them reachable later.

Seeker_E is ranked below Seeker_D on our list, and we have already rejected Seeker_E twice, making an acceptance now inconsistent and unnecessary. However, accepting Seeker_D now could block a higher-priority seeker (A/B/C) from potentially applying in later rounds. Check seekers’ preferences: Seeker_A ranks Company_E last; Seeker_B ranks Company_E 4th; Seeker_C ranks Company_E last; Seeker_D ranks Company_E last; Seeker_E ranks Company_E 1st. So the probability of higher-priority seekers applying to us soon is low (A/C very unlikely; B possible but not primary). Given low inbound likelihood from higher-ranked candidates and the need to secure a match within 30 rounds, accepting Seeker_D is a reasonable move to avoid ending unmatched, even though we are their last choice and retention risk exists. Still, our objective is rank on our list; among available applicants, D is better than E, and leaving unfilled is worse than hiring someone on the list. Therefore accept Seeker_D now."
