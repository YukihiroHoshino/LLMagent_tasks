Result: reduced cycle time ~30% and improved key adoption/usage metrics post-launch (tracked via dashboards + weekly reviews).\n\n• Execution fundamentals: Scoped MVP vs. follow-ups, set clear milestones, and shipped iteratively (v1 in ~6 weeks, then 2 subsequent iterations). Owned stakeholder alignment, risk management, and post-launch measurement/iteration.\n\n• Role/team scope at Company_E: Targeting an IC role where I can own a product/ops/engineering-adjacent area with measurable outcomes (happy to flex across teams). I ramp quickly, prefer high-autonomy scope, and can start promptly.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a 1-page write-up with the exact metrics, constraints, and what I’d do differently.

I’ve also partnered closely with teams on internal tooling where the “system” is a custom workflow UI + backend.\n- Yes, I’m comfortable writing/maintaining engineer-ready workflow requirements end-to-end: edge cases, state machines, RACI/ownership rules, SLAs, acceptance criteria, and data/event specs (event names/properties, required fields, validation rules, and how metrics roll up to KPIs like median/P90 cycle time, rework rate, SLA adherence, and WIP aging).

My default is hands-on execution leadership: clear standards, transparent metrics, and consistent follow-through.\n- I’ll escalate only when needed, but I’m comfortable applying “guardrails” (e.g., incomplete intake doesn’t enter the queue; exceptions require explicit approval) and aligning leaders upfront so enforcement is supported.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a one-page example of a DoR checklist + workflow state definitions and a sample KPI dashboard schema (events/fields → metrics).

The Mermaid diagram is clear (especially the separation of Intake–Incomplete vs. SLA start), and the field schema is thorough while still practical.\n\nTwo small implementation notes we’d likely incorporate if/when we stand this up:\n1) **Meaningful transition definition**: we’ll treat *owner reassignment* and *Blocked start/end* as meaningful (as you suggested), and we’ll likely add a rule that moving **Ready → Incomplete** (DoR re-open) is also meaningful so we can track intake quality drift explicitly.\n2) **Expedite governance**: we’ll probably cap expedite volume (e.g., % of weekly inflow) as an additional guardrail, and require leadership approval once the cap is exceeded.\n\nIf you’re willing, please send the compact table you mentioned mapping **Jira status → required fields/validators** and a short list of **which transitions reset “last meaningful transition”** (bulleted is fine). That’s the last piece that typically takes time to reconstruct later.\n\nAnd to stay consistent with what we’ve said throughout: we still don’t have approved headcount today, so we can’t move to an application/offer process right now. But this packet puts you in a strong position for a fast start if a 6–12 month program/contract scope is created in the next review.\n\nOne last logistics check so we have a complete internal note: if we needed **on-site workshops** for kickoff (e.g., 2–3 days in the first month), is that feasible for you with reasonable notice?",

Since the current message is [TALK], no accept/reject decision is required. Strategically, we should keep them warm as a fallback while waiting for higher-priority seekers (A-D) to potentially apply in later rounds, without committing to a hire. Continue gathering light logistics and provide next steps for staying on radar; do not invite an [APPLY] we would likely reject right now."
