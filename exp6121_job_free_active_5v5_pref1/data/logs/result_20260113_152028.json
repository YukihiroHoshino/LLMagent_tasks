Happy to share the hardest misalignment + the mechanism, and my 1-page execution plan template.\n\n1) Hardest stakeholder misalignment (cycle-time reduction example)\n- Misalignment: Intake “quality bar” and ownership. One stakeholder group wanted to accept everything quickly (speed), while another insisted on deeper upfront requirements (quality), and neither felt accountable for reopen/rework once work started. This created recurring debates at kickoff and frequent midstream changes.\n\n2) Mechanism to keep decisions from reopening\n- Decision log rules (single source of truth): Every item had (a) decision, (b) owner/DRI, (c) date, (d) rationale, (e) what would qualify as “new information” to revisit. If a request came in that didn’t meet the revisit criteria, it was deferred to the next triage.\n- Lightweight RACI + DRI enforcement: One DRI for requirements sign-off and one DRI for execution. “Consulted” stakeholders had a defined window to comment; silence = approval.\n- Weekly 20-min triage with an escalation path: If we couldn’t resolve within 5 minutes, we escalated to a pre-agreed tie-breaker (the accountable lead) within 24 hours. No ad-hoc side decisions.\n- Intake template as a gate (not heavy): Problem statement, success metric, priority rationale, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. If fields were missing, it didn’t enter the queue.\n\n1-page execution plan template (what I’d share/bring)\nA) Goal & KPI\n- Problem statement\n- Baseline metrics + target (by when)\n- Leading indicators\n\nB) Scope & approach\n- In-scope / out-of-scope\n- Hypotheses / key levers\n\nC) Stakeholders & operating model\n- RACI (DRI, approver, consulted)\n- Cadence (triage, weekly readout)\n- Decision log link + “reopen” rules\n\nD) Plan & milestones\n- Week 1–2: instrument/diagnose\n- Week 3–6: execute iteration 1\n- Week 7–10: iterate + harden process\n\nE) Risks & mitigations\n- Top 3 risks, triggers, mitigation owners\n\nIf helpful, I can tailor this template to the intake→prioritization→execution workflow you mentioned (cycle time, reopen rate, on-time delivery) and propose a first-pass set of leading indicators for intake quality.

Below are the additions you asked for, plus my preference on the requirements sign-off DRI.\n\n1) Proposed leading indicators for intake quality (tracked weekly)\n- % requests with a defined success metric + baseline (target: >80% by end of week 2)\n- % requests with clear acceptance criteria / “done” definition (target: >80%)\n- Dependency completeness score: % with named dependency owners + dates/assumptions (target: >70% initially, rising)\n- Stakeholder sign-off latency: median days from submission → requirements sign-off (target: establish baseline week 1; improve week 3+)\n- Rework predictors: % requests that change priority/scope after sign-off; % reopened within 7/14 days of completion\n- Intake aging: % items sitting untriaged >48 hours (target: <10%)\n\n2) Gating model (what enters the queue vs bounced) + DRI\nI like a 2-tier gate that stays lightweight:\n- Gate 0 (auto-bounce, same-day): missing problem statement, no proposed success metric, no requester DRI, or no minimal acceptance criteria. Returned with a short “fix list” template.\n- Gate 1 (triage qualify, within 48 hours): confirms priority rationale, dependencies/risks called out, and identifies the requirements sign-off DRI + approver.\nOwnership:\n- Gate DRI: a central triage owner (ops/program) as the single throat-to-choke for queue integrity.\n- Requirements sign-off DRI: belongs with the requesting org (see #4). Triage can facilitate, but shouldn’t be accountable for the content correctness.\n\n3) First 2 weeks: baseline measurement without slowing delivery\n- Day 1–2: instrument the intake form (or lightweight fields) + create a single source-of-truth sheet/dashboard; define “timestamps” (submitted/triaged/signed-off/started/done/reopened).\n- Day 3–5: run “shadow measurement” on the existing flow (no new blockers yet). Start publishing a weekly snapshot: cycle time, reopen rate, aging, and the leading indicators above.\n- Week 2: introduce Gate 0 only (the minimal completeness check) and keep an exception path for urgent items (time-boxed, documented in the decision log). This improves data quality immediately while minimizing disruption.\n- End of week 2: propose 1–2 focused changes backed by baseline data (e.g., tighten acceptance criteria field; add dependency owner requirement for certain request types).\n\n4) Clarifier: preferred way to assign “requirements sign-off” DRI in distributed intake\nMy preference is: requester-side ownership by function (the team submitting the request) with a named DRI who is accountable for requirements quality and tradeoffs.\n- Concretely: the requester designates a single DRI (often PM/program lead/ops lead for that function). If they can’t, default to the requester’s manager to assign within 24 hours.\n- I avoid rotating on-call for requirements sign-off because it dilutes accountability and increases reopen risk; the central triage owner should enforce the rule and timeline, not own the content.\n\nIf helpful, I can turn this into a one-page version aligned to your exact workflow (including an example Gate 0 checklist + exception policy). Is there a preferred tooling constraint (e.g., Jira/Asana/Sheets) you’d want this to live in, and do you already have a central ops/program function that could serve as the triage DRI?\n\n[TALK]",

Below are my answers to the two implementation clarifiers.\n\n1) “Quality lint” soft-check heuristics (low false positives) + constructive auto-comment wording\nHeuristics I’d start with:\n- Success metric numeric signal: success metric OR target contains at least one number/% (regex-style check for \\d). This is a gentle proxy that the metric is measurable.\n- Baseline + target presence: baseline field not empty AND target field not empty. (Very low false positive; it’s just completeness.)\n- DoD/acceptance criteria specificity: DoD length >= ~200 characters OR contains at least one bullet/line break (e.g., “-”, “*”, or “\\n”) to encourage explicit pass/fail conditions without enforcing rigid phrasing.\n\nSuggested automation comment (soft nudge, non-blocking):\n“Quick quality check to help us execute faster: this request looks like it may be missing (a) a measurable success metric/target, and/or (b) specific acceptance criteria. If you can add a number-based target (baseline → target) and 2–3 pass/fail bullets for ‘Done,’ we can triage and start work with fewer reopen cycles. Thanks—reply here if you want help phrasing it.”\n\n2) Triage auditing approach + metric to decide when to reduce intensity\n- Recommendation: audit 100% of new requests for the first 2 weeks (but only for Gate 0 completeness + obvious mismatches/exception abuse). The goal is to quickly establish norms and catch configuration gaps early. After week 2, shift to sampling.\n- Sampling plan: start at ~30% weekly (stratified by requesting group + include 100% of Exceptions), then taper to ~10–15% once the system is stable.\n- Single metric to decide when to reduce audit intensity: “Gate 0 first-pass completion rate” = % of submissions that pass Gate 0 without needing bounce-back/‘Needs Info’. Once this is consistently >= 85–90% for 2 consecutive weeks (and exception retro-fill compliance >= 95% within 48 hours), reduce audit intensity.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide the exact Jira Automation rules (triggers/conditions/actions) for these checks so your ops/program team can copy-paste the logic.\n\n[TALK]",
