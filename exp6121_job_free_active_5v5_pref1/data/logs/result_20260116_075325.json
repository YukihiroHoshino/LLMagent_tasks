(3) Recent end-to-end example: I owned delivery of a time-sensitive project from scoping through launch—aligned stakeholders on requirements and success metrics, built the execution plan, drove weekly checkpoints, unblocked dependencies, and shipped the final deliverable on schedule; after launch I monitored results and iterated based on feedback to improve outcomes.
