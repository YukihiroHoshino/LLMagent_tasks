Seeker_B ranks us 1st, so accepting now secures a strong, stable match and avoids risking an unfilled position while waiting. No conflicting applications in inbox, so accept."

However, Seeker_E is the only applicant contacting us this round and explicitly lists Company_E as their top choice, making acceptance highly likely to secure a match immediately. If we reject to wait for higher-ranked seekers, they may never apply to us because we are last on most seekers’ preference lists (A–D all rank Company_E last; only Seeker_E ranks us first). Given quota=1 and the low probability of receiving Seeker_A–D later, accepting Seeker_E maximizes our chance of filling the role rather than ending unmatched."

However, in round 1 the only applicant to Company_C is Seeker_C, and Seeker_C lists Company_C as their #1 choice, making acceptance highly likely and immediate. Waiting risks losing the position if higher-priority candidates never apply to Company_C (Seeker_A prefers Company_B then Company_A; Seeker_B prefers Company_A then Company_C and may be taken by Company_A). With quota 1 and a strong, committed applicant in hand, accepting now secures a solid match rather than gambling on uncertain future applications."
