Seeker_B lists Company_A as their #1 choice, so accepting likely locks a stable match immediately. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A’s top choice is Company_B, so they may never apply to Company_A (or may do so late). With quota 1 and identical priorities across companies, early acceptance of a high-ranked, highly committed candidate (rank #2) is advantageous and avoids ending unmatched."

In round 1, only Seeker_C has applied to us and we can lock in a guaranteed acceptable match now. However, Seeker_A ranks Company_C third (behind B and A) and Seeker_B ranks Company_C second (behind A), so they may apply elsewhere first and might never reach us.

The main reason we didn’t move forward last round wasn’t a single skill gap—it was that we’re prioritizing candidates whose background most closely matches our current immediate needs for this opening, and we have to be selective given limited headcount.\n\nThat said, I’m open to reconsidering if you can share (1) the 2–3 most relevant projects you’ve led that map directly to this role, (2) your earliest start date, and (3) whether you’d be open to a short, clearly-scoped paid project/contract-to-hire as a first step. If there’s strong alignment on those points, we can revisit next steps quickly.\n\n[TALK]",

In this round only Seeker_E contacted us, but it’s early (round 2) and other seekers will likely pursue their higher-ranked companies first; however, we should keep the channel open with Seeker_E without accepting. Since Seeker_E sent [TALK], we respond [TALK], provide a non-committal reason aligned with priorities, and invite an update that could justify reconsideration while we continue to wait for higher-ranked candidates."
