With only 1 quota, accepting Seeker_E now guarantees a filled position but sacrifices any chance—however small—of landing a higher-ranked seeker later. Since A-D have better options and Company_E is their last choice, the probability of receiving an application from them is low; still, waiting could be rational if we strongly value priority ranking over certainty.
