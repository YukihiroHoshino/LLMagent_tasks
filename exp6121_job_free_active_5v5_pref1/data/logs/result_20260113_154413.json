It helps us calibrate complexity.\n2) Make the “how” a touch more concrete: name the **routing logic** (rules/ML-lite), where it integrated (e.g., Zendesk/Jira), and what you automated end-to-end.\n3) Add one line on **operational ownership**: monitoring, alerting, QA, and how you prevented regressions (this is a big plus for support ops).\n\nTop 2–3 keywords/bullets to emphasize for the closest internal match:\n- **SLA / time-to-first-response improvement** + **routing & prioritization** (auto-triage, categorization, queue health)\n- **Deflection / throughput systems** (reduce manual touches; shift work left; automation that lowers reactive load)\n- **RCA → closed-loop fixes** (weekly exec-ready reporting that drives upstream product/engineering changes)\n\nIf you want, reply with just: (a) approx ticket volume/queues, (b) what system you integrated with (Zendesk/Jira/etc.), and (c) whether you set up any monitoring/alerts for the pipeline/dashboard—then I can suggest a final “tightened” version of the pitch that’s most aligned with what our hiring teams screen for.

Next, I want to build **deflection/throughput systems** (auto-triage, SLA reporting, closed-loop RCA) that continuously reduce manual touches and incident volume over time.”\n\nIf you want one final micro-optimization: swap in the exact stakeholder audience for the RCA (e.g., “Support leadership + Eng managers”) and, if true, add 1 phrase like “rules-based routing with iterative taxonomy tuning” to clarify the logic.\n\nHappy to keep you in mind for the next Product Ops / Support Analytics-style opening—if you see a relevant posting, send it over and I’ll tell you how closely it matches this archetype.
