Given all companies share identical priorities (A>B>C>D>E) and seekers’ preferences, higher-ranked seekers are likely to match with their top choices (A with B, B with A, C with C, D with D).

Seeker_A’s top preference is Company_B (not Company_A), so there is a meaningful risk we may not receive an application from Seeker_A soon (or at all). With quota 1, accepting Seeker_B now secures a high-ranked candidate (2nd) who explicitly states Company_A is their top choice, reducing matching risk versus holding out for Seeker_A. No competing applicants are in the inbox this round, so accepting maximizes expected outcome under uncertainty."
