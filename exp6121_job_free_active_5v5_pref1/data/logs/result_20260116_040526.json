I’m also open to a short paid trial/contract project to de-risk the decision if that’s helpful.\n\nIf you can share the top 1–2 factors where the current leading candidates are stronger (e.g., domain experience, specific tools, stakeholder exposure), I can address them directly.",

Net impact: cleared backlog in 3 weeks and sustained the new SLA for 2 consecutive months.\n\n2) 30/60-day plan (assumptions: I’m ramping on your specific systems/processes):\n- First 30 days (Ramp + diagnose):\n  • Align on one core workstream to own; clarify success metrics (1–2 primary, 2–3 guardrails).\n  • Deep dive your day-to-day systems/processes: shadow operators, map the workflow, identify top 3 failure modes.\n  • Establish operating cadence: weekly metrics review + stakeholder sync; define escalation paths.\n  • Deliverable by day 30: “Current-state map + bottleneck analysis” and a prioritized 4-week execution plan with expected metric lift.\n- Days 31–60 (Execute + stabilize):\n  • Ship the top 1–2 improvements (process + tooling) with rollout plan and training.\n  • Instrument dashboards/alerts so performance is visible and sustained.\n  • Deliverable by day 60: measurable movement in the primary metric(s), plus a documented runbook and owner handoffs where needed.\n\n3) Proposed paid trial (10 business days, time-boxed):\n- Deliverables:\n  (a) Current-state workflow map for a chosen core process + top 3 bottlenecks/root causes\n  (b) Metrics definition + lightweight dashboard spec (what to track, where it lives, cadence)\n  (c) A prioritized “Fix Plan” with one quick-win implemented (if access allows) OR an implementation-ready PRD/task breakdown\n- Success metric: you should be able to judge (i) speed of ramp on your domain/tooling, (ii) quality of diagnosis, and (iii) clarity/actionability of the plan; plus at least one measurable quick-win or a clearly scoped implementation plan.\n\nIf you tell me the specific system/process/tooling stack most central to the role, I can tailor the trial deliverable to match your immediate needs.

I can work in your required time zone/hours for stakeholder syncs, and I’m comfortable using VPN/SSO/MFA if needed. I can use your SQL environment as provided (read-only is fine) and can also work from approved exports if that’s your preference.\n\n2) Production changes: Yes—fully comfortable proposing changes and having your admin implement them during the trial if direct write access isn’t possible. I’ll provide clear, step-by-step change requests (fields/rules/workflows), plus a rollback plan and a way to validate impact.\n\nIf that works, please go ahead and send the SOW + kickoff agenda + required access/accounts list. I’m ready to sign and start next business day after SOW signature (or kickoff Monday as you suggested).",

              "thought": "Seeker_D is the only candidate engaging Company_D this round and appears to be the only viable path to filling our single quota. While Seeker_D is ranked 4th on our true priority list (A, B, C ahead), none of those higher-priority seekers are currently in our inbox and, given seekers’ preferences, they are likely matched elsewhere or not targeting us. We already progressed Seeker_D through a well-defined paid trial step that directly addresses our stated gaps (domain/tooling depth and comparable scope). Continuing the process preserves optionality without consuming the quota via an [ACCEPT] (since they have not sent [APPLY]) and maintains alignment with our earlier commitment. Therefore respond with [TALK], confirm next steps, and send SOW/kickoff details and required access list."
