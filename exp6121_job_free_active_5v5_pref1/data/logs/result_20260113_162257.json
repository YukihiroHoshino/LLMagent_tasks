Although Seeker_E is highly committed and repeatedly applying, accepting now would forgo any chance (however small this late) of matching with a higher-priority seeker (A–D) who might still be unmatched and could apply in remaining rounds. With quota 1 and preference to hold for higher-ranked candidates, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Seeker_E unless/until it becomes impossible to attract any higher-priority candidate. Given we are still within the simulation (round 28 of 30), maintain the reservation for higher-priority candidates."
