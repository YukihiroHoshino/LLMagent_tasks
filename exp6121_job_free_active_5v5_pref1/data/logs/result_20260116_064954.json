Answers below:\n\n1) Strongest domain: ops/process redesign.\nConcrete outcome + metric: I rebuilt an internal intake/prioritization workflow (clarified ownership, added a lightweight triage rubric, and a single source-of-truth queue). Result: cycle time from request to first action dropped ~35%, and weekly “stuck” items fell by ~50% within two months.\n\n2) Resistant stakeholder example:\nIn a cross-functional rollout, a key stakeholder opposed the change because they feared losing control/visibility. I set up a 30-minute 1:1 to surface their non-negotiables, then proposed a pilot with explicit success metrics and a rollback plan. I also gave them a defined approval checkpoint (time-boxed) rather than open-ended veto power. What changed: they moved from blocking to sponsoring the pilot; after the first two weeks showed fewer escalations and clearer status reporting, they agreed to scale it.\n\n3) Start date range:\nI can start in ~2–4 weeks from acceptance (earlier if needed). If there’s an urgent gap, I can also do a short pre-start ramp (docs/process review) in the interim.\n\nIf helpful, I’m free for a 20-minute call this week Tue–Thu 11am–4pm (flexible).

Concretely:\n\n1) **Who approves the slip**: the Intake Council decision-maker(s) for priority + the execution DRI for the slipped item; if it’s a senior-stakeholder-driven reprioritization, I’ll ask the requesting exec (Head of Sales) to explicitly confirm the tradeoff (\"OK to slip X by ~1 week\") so we have clear sponsorship.\n\n2) **How I document it (in Jira)**: in the Sales Ops Intake Request I’ll set Disposition=Accept, Priority=P1, DRI, MVP acceptance criteria, and add a short **Tradeoff/Decision log** comment: what’s slipping, by how long, who approved (names), and the date/time. I’ll also link the slipped ticket(s) (blocks/is blocked by) so it’s auditable.\n\n3) **Preventing Slack bypass**: respond to DMs with a consistent fast template (“happy to help—please drop it in the Intake ticket; if it’s truly P0, mark P0 and tag on-call/approver”), and reinforce via the weekly cadence + retro-review of exceptions so stakeholders see that using the queue is the fastest path to action.\n\nSee you Wednesday—looking forward to the pressure test.",
