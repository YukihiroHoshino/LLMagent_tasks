Also, Seeker_A ranks Company_B as their #1 choice, so accepting now secures our top candidate and avoids risk of losing them to another company in subsequent rounds. No other inbox messages this round create a better option than our top-ranked seeker, so immediate acceptance is optimal."

              "thought": "Company_A is my top true preference. All companies share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), so I am ranked #2 everywhere and could likely be accepted if I apply early before Company_A fills with Seeker_A. To maximize my chance at my first choice, I should apply to Company_A immediately with a clear, committed message."

              "thought": "Company_A has quota 1 and true priority ranks Seeker_A above Seeker_B. However, only Seeker_B has applied this round, and Seeker_B ranks Company_A as their top choice, making acceptance likely to lock a stable match. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A prefers Company_B over Company_A and may never apply. Given the goal to fill with as high a priority candidate as possible within 30 rounds, accepting Seeker_B now is a strong outcome (2nd choice) with high certainty versus uncertain prospects of landing Seeker_A."

I’d like to formally apply and be considered for your open position. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "Company_C is my top choice on my true preference list, and in round 1 it is best to apply immediately to maximize my chance of securing my most-preferred match before other seekers compete for it.

Given the one-off message constraint per round and uncertainty that higher-priority seekers (A or B) will apply to us soon (they each prefer other companies over us), accepting Seeker_C now secures a solid candidate within our list and avoids the risk of ending unmatched. With quota=1, we should lock in this match."

              "thought": "Company_D is my top true preference. With identical company priority rankings favoring Seeker_A > Seeker_B > Seeker_C > Seeker_D > Seeker_E, I should apply immediately to my first choice to have any chance before the company fills its single slot."

Since all companies share the same priority list, top seekers (A/B/C) are likely to be contested and may not reach us. Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their #1, so accepting now secures a mutually strong match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched. No higher-ranked candidate is currently in our inbox, so accept."

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and our true priority ranks Seeker_E last. In round 1, only Seeker_E applied to us; however, higher-priority seekers (A–D) all rank Company_E last, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. Waiting risks ending unmatched, but accepting now locks in our lowest-ranked option. Given the 30-round horizon and that Seeker_E ranks us first and is ready to commit, the safest way to secure a match is to accept now rather than gamble on unlikely later interest from higher-ranked seekers."
