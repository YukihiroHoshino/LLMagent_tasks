Waiting risks losing Seeker_C to another company later while Seeker_A prefers Company_B/Company_A over Company_C and Seeker_B prefers Company_A over Company_C, so neither is guaranteed to apply to us.

Although Seeker_E has applied and ranks us #1, accepting now could prevent matching with higher-priority seekers (A-D) who may come later as they get rejected by their top choices. Since all companies share the same priority list (A>B>C>D>E), competition for top seekers is high and those top seekers will likely be accepted elsewhere early, but we should still preserve the option at least for a round rather than lock in our lowest-ranked candidate immediately.

Waiting risks losing Seeker_B to other companies (Seeker_B ranks us #1 but could still apply elsewhere if rejected), and there is no guarantee Seeker_A will apply to us (Seeker_A ranks Company_B above us).

In this round we must respond with [TALK] (not accept/reject). We should be transparent that we’re still hiring but are prioritizing candidates aligned to current needs, and invite a concise follow-up that could justify reconsideration without signaling likely acceptance."

To maximize expected outcome within 30 rounds, accepting Seeker_E now secures a filled role rather than remaining unmatched."
