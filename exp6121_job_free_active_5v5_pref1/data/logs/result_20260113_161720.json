Given the long history where we have consistently indicated no reopen triggers and have not invited an application, and since Seeker_E only sent [TALK] (not [APPLY]), the best move is to maintain the same stance: keep them on standby and avoid commitment. This preserves optionality for higher-ranked seekers through round 30 while staying consistent with prior communication."

However, our true priority list ranks Seeker_E last, and we prefer leaving the position unfilled over hiring someone not on the list; Seeker_E is on the list but lowest priority. With one round left, there is no indication higher-priority seekers (A–D) are engaging us; still, we have repeatedly stated we are not reopening consideration absent specific triggers, and none have occurred. Accepting now would contradict our stated evaluation stance and could lock us into our lowest-ranked option when we might still end unmatched by design.
