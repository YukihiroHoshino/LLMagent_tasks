I personally created/updated monitors, tuned alert thresholds, added custom metrics, and instrumented a couple of traces/spans to isolate bottlenecks.\n- Logs: centralized logging via ELK-style stack (Kibana for querying). I added structured log fields to improve correlation.\n- Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes; CI/CD via GitHub Actions (build/test) and ArgoCD-style GitOps deploys. I personally updated CI checks for performance-related guardrails, created a canary rollout step for the service, and owned the deploy + rollback runbook.\n- Cloud/runtime: AWS (EKS, ALB), plus managed Postgres.\n\n3) One more directly analogous project (closest overlap)\n- Domain/problem: reducing incident rate and tail latency for an event-driven ingestion + processing service feeding a customer-facing dashboard (strict freshness + reliability constraints).\n- What I owned: on-call incident lead for recurring failures; identified failure modes (backpressure, poison messages, retry storms), implemented idempotency + DLQ handling, and added SLO-based alerting.\n- Tooling depth: Kafka (consumer group tuning, lag monitoring), Kubernetes (resource requests/limits, HPA tuning), Datadog (lag/latency/error dashboards + alerts), and Postgres query/index tuning for the dashboard read path.\n- Outcome: materially reduced paging frequency, improved data freshness, and brought p95 latency back within target during peak periods.\n- What I’d do differently: implement load-shedding earlier and add automated regression checks for consumer lag + DLQ growth.\n\nIf this is now a tight enough overlap to your target domain/toolset, I’m ready for the short targeted screen immediately (today/tomorrow).

Our true priority list ranks Seeker_E last, and we previously rejected them twice, but after detailed discussion they now appear much closer to our desired profile and we already committed to a targeted screen with an immediate yes/no afterward. Accepting now would lock the seat before completing the agreed validation and could be suboptimal if a higher-priority seeker (A/B/C) applies later. However, we must respond to an [APPLY] with either [ACCEPT] or [REJECT]. Given our stated process and desire to keep the seat for closer matches, we should REJECT for now while keeping the scheduled screen as a pre-offer evaluation; but a rejection would likely end negotiations and lose the candidate. Since they are the only active candidate and the market is late (round 16) with others likely matched, and we have strong evidence of fit, the best way to fill the seat with a viable candidate is to ACCEPT contingent on the screen outcome, though the protocol has no conditional accept. To avoid losing them and because they now meet our narrower profile signals, we ACCEPT and proceed to the screen as onboarding/verification, honoring our commitment to move fast."
