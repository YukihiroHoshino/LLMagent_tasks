[APPLY]\n\n30–60 day plan (focus: ambiguity, written clarity, end-to-end ownership)\n• Days 1–10: Ramp + align\n  - Read key docs/metrics dashboards; map stakeholders and current priorities.\n  - Deliver a 1–2 page written “Problem/Goals/Constraints” brief for one ambiguous area you’re tackling, plus a proposed success metric and decision log.\n• Days 11–30: Scope → execute a first measurable win\n  - Run discovery (data + 5–8 stakeholder/customer interviews) and synthesize into a clear recommendation memo.\n  - Define MVP scope, timeline, and owners; ship an initial solution/experiment.\n  - Report results in a short post-launch write-up (what shipped, metric movement, learnings, next steps).\n• Days 31–60: Expand impact + operationalize\n  - Iterate based on results; scale to additional segments/teams.\n  - Create lightweight operating rhythm (weekly written update, risk register, and KPI review) so progress stays visible and cross-functional alignment stays tight.\n\nConcrete examples (ownership + metrics)\n1) Ambiguous project → shipped outcome:\n  - Led an end-to-end initiative where the problem was loosely defined (stakeholders disagreed on goals). I wrote the alignment memo, set the KPI, scoped the MVP, and coordinated execution across partners.\n  - Result: reduced cycle time by ~25% and improved on-time delivery by ~15% over the next quarter (measured via team dashboard). I owned scoping, prioritization, and the final rollout plan.\n\n2) Cross-functional written communication → measurable results:\n  - Owned a process/tooling improvement requiring buy-in across multiple teams. I created a decision doc, ran a structured review, and maintained a clear weekly written status that surfaced risks early.\n  - Result: cut recurring operational escalations by ~30% and improved stakeholder satisfaction (internal survey) by ~0.6 points on a 5-point scale over 2 months.\n\nIf helpful, I can send a short (1-page) version of the above formatted as a memo, plus references/work samples.

As requested, here’s a concise memo tailored to angle (1): reducing cycle time in a cross-functional workflow with unclear ownership.\n\nTitle: 2-Week MVP to Reduce Cycle Time in an Unowned Cross-Functional Workflow\n\n1) Problem statement (current state)\nCycle time is high and unpredictable because ownership is fragmented across teams, handoffs are informal, and decision rights are unclear. Work stalls in “waiting states” (review/approval/clarification), but the system doesn’t make blockers visible early.\n\n2) Goal (what success looks like)\nReduce end-to-end cycle time while improving predictability and minimizing rework.\n\n3) Primary KPI + supporting metrics\nPrimary KPI:\n- Median cycle time (start → shipped/complete) for the workflow’s standard work items.\n\nSupporting metrics:\n- 75th percentile cycle time (predictability / tail reduction)\n- “Waiting time” share (% time in blocked/review states)\n- Rework rate (items reopened / returned for changes)\n- On-time delivery rate vs. committed date (if commitments exist)\n\nBaseline plan:\n- Pull last 4–8 weeks of items; compute baseline median + p75; segment by team/hand-off type.\n\n4) Scope (2-week MVP)\nFocus on one high-volume workflow slice (e.g., the most common request type) involving 2–3 teams and at least one approval step. The MVP is not a full process redesign; it’s a lightweight ownership + visibility layer that removes avoidable waiting.\n\n5) Decision points + decision rights (explicit)\nDecision Point A: Intake acceptance + prioritization\n- DRI: single named Workflow Owner (rotating weekly if needed)\n- Inputs: request completeness checklist + impact/urgency\n- Output: accept/decline + priority + target date\n\nDecision Point B: Handoff readiness\n- DRI: sending team lead/IC owner\n- Output: “handoff-ready” definition met (requirements, artifacts, test/validation expectations)\n\nDecision Point C: Approval/Review SLA\n- DRI: approving function lead\n- Output: approve / request changes within defined SLA (e.g., 48 business hours)\n\nEscalation rule:\n- Any item blocked > X hours triggers escalation to Workflow Owner + relevant lead with a clear unblock ask.\n\n6) MVP mechanics (what changes in 2 weeks)\n- Define a single Workflow Owner (DRI) and publish the “definition of done” for each stage.\n- Introduce a simple status taxonomy: New → In Discovery → In Build → In Review → Blocked (with reason) → Done.\n- Add SLAs for review/approval steps and a standard “blocker template” (what’s blocked, by whom, what decision needed, by when).\n- Implement a lightweight tracking board/dashboard (could be existing tooling) showing:\n  - item age, current state, blocker reason, next decision owner, SLA timer.\n\n7) 2-week execution plan\nDays 1–2: Diagnose + align\n- Pull baseline metrics; identify top 2 waiting states.\n- 30-min alignment with involved leads: confirm Workflow Owner, SLAs, and stage definitions.\n\nDays 3–5: Implement MVP layer\n- Configure board/dashboard + blocker template.\n- Pilot with a small batch (e.g., 10–20 items) and run daily 10-min unblock standup (time-boxed).\n\nWeek 2: Run + iterate\n- Enforce SLAs and escalation rule.\n- Mid-week: adjust definitions where rework shows up.\n- End of week: report KPI movement + top blockers + proposed next iteration.\n\n8) Risks + mitigations\n- Risk: “Process overhead” perception → Mitigation: keep artifacts minimal, time-box rituals, measure waiting time reduction.\n- Risk: No true authority for Workflow Owner → Mitigation: get explicit sponsorship for escalation path and decision rights.\n- Risk: Metrics disputed → Mitigation: agree on measurement rules on Day 1 (start/end timestamps, item types included).\n\n9) Expected outcome (what I’d aim to show quickly)\nWithin 2 weeks: visible reduction in blocked aging and clearer decision ownership; early signal of median cycle time improvement (even if modest) and a concrete list of systemic bottlenecks to address next.\n\nIf helpful, I can also reformat this into a 1–2 page doc with your internal headings/style.

              "message": "Hi Company_E team—thank you for the direct questions. Here are two concrete answers.\n\n1) Securing/maintaining decision rights for a Workflow Owner when leads didn’t agree (real example)\nContext: I led a cross-functional “release readiness” workflow spanning Eng, QA, and Product. Each function wanted final say, which created repeated last-minute reversals and stalled releases.\nWhat I did:\n- Aligned on the *decision catalog* first (intake priority, readiness criteria, go/no-go, exception handling) and documented it in a 1-page RACI/DRI note.\n- Got an explicit sponsor: I met 1:1 with the Eng Director (who owned the delivery KPI) and asked for a clear escalation path + confirmation that the Workflow Owner could make day-to-day calls within agreed criteria.\n- Converted disagreement into *pre-commitment*: I ran a 45-min working session with the three leads to define “release-ready” as a checklist with thresholds (tests passing, known issues policy, rollback plan). The key was: functional leads retained authority to set the criteria, but the Workflow Owner owned enforcement and the ship decision *when criteria were met*.\n- Instituted a standing “exception” mechanism: if someone wanted to block despite criteria being met, they had to (a) state the risk, (b) propose mitigation, and (c) accept the schedule impact in writing in the decision log.\nWhat changed:\n- We reduced last-minute reversals and eliminated most “silent vetoes.” The Workflow Owner role became durable because it was anchored to agreed criteria + a sponsor-backed escalation rule, not personal persuasion each time.\n\n2) If baseline data is messy, how I define measurement rules and still produce a credible 2-week before/after\nMy approach is to (a) agree on a minimally-controversial metric definition, (b) triangulate with two sources, and (c) be explicit about confidence/coverage.\nConcretely:\n- Day 1: Pick 1–2 “auditable” timestamps that exist most often (e.g., ticket created, PR merged, deployment timestamp, request marked done). If intermediate states are missing, I’ll measure cycle time between the most reliable endpoints and separately track “blocked aging” via lightweight manual tags during the pilot.\n- Establish measurement rules in writing (what item types included/excluded; how to handle missing end times; how to treat weekends; definition of “done”). I get quick sign-off from the functional leads so we don’t relitigate later.\n- Create two baselines:\n  (i) Historical baseline from the best-available system data (even if partial), and\n  (ii) Pilot baseline from a small hand-audited sample (e.g., last 15–20 items) to validate directionality.\n- During the 2-week MVP: enforce consistent state transitions for the pilot batch only (small scope), so the “after” read is clean even if the broader historical data isn’t.\n- Report with transparency: coverage % (e.g., “70% of items had reliable start/end”), sensitivity checks (median vs p75; with/without outliers), and a qualitative blocker summary to explain *why* the numbers moved.\n\nIf helpful, I can condense the above into a tight 1-pager with the exact headings you use internally. Happy to jump on a quick call as well if that accelerates your headcount/role-scope decision. [TALK]",
