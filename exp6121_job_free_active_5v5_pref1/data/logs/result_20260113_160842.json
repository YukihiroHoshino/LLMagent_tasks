However, given all companies share identical priorities (A>B>C>D>E), higher-ranked seekers are likely to be taken by other companies they prefer more, making it unlikely Company_E will later secure A-D. Still, with 30 rounds available, it is strategically better to reject now and wait at least a few rounds to see if any higher-ranked seeker applies; if none do, Company_E can accept Seeker_E in a later round if they re-apply.

We’re happy to move forward.\n\nLet’s schedule the 30-minute screen for **Tue 10:30 AM PT** (within your Tue 10–12 window). If that doesn’t work, I can also do **Wed 1:30 PM PT** or **Thu 9:30 AM PT**—please confirm which you prefer.\n\nOnce you confirm, I’ll send the calendar invite and details for the screen (we’ll focus on the KPI/metrics reliability work and a short walkthrough of your approach to data-quality prevention). \n\n[ACCEPT]",

While Seeker_E is lowest on our true priority list, the market is late (round 6), we have no current matches, and Seeker_E has demonstrated strong fit through multiple TALK rounds and is ready to proceed immediately. Given no higher-priority seekers are currently engaging us and leaving the role unfilled is worse than taking a proven-fit candidate from our acceptable set, accept now to secure the hire."
