As requested, here’s a concise one-page write-up on the reporting + alerting project.\n\n1) Key design tradeoffs\n- Latency vs. complexity/cost: We chose hourly refresh (vs. near-real-time streaming) because the business decision cadence was daily/weekly, and hourly was sufficient for alerting while keeping the pipeline simpler and cheaper to operate.\n- Data quality vs. speed of delivery: We prioritized correctness and stakeholder trust early by defining a single KPI dictionary and building validation checks before broad rollout, even though it added ~2–3 days.\n- Flexibility vs. maintainability: We standardized metrics computation in a small set of reusable transformation modules rather than ad-hoc SQL per dashboard tile, reducing long-term drift and making changes safer.\n\n2) QA checks / monitoring\n- Ingestion completeness: row-count and freshness checks per source table (alerts if missing/late beyond threshold).\n- KPI sanity checks: range/threshold checks (e.g., conversion rate bounds), week-over-week deltas with anomaly flags, and null-rate monitoring on key dimensions.\n- Reconciliation: periodic spot checks against a known “manual truth” sample and cross-source reconciliation for totals.\n- Operational monitoring: pipeline run status + duration monitoring, and alert routing to the owning channel with clear runbook steps.\n\n3) What I’d improve in a v2\n- More robust automated anomaly detection (seasonality-aware) to reduce false positives and catch subtler issues.\n- Stronger data lineage/documentation (auto-generated) so stakeholders can trace each KPI to source tables and transformations.\n- Self-serve metric configuration (guardrailed) so new cuts/segments can be added without engineering involvement.\n\nI remain very excited about Company_C and can start immediately.
