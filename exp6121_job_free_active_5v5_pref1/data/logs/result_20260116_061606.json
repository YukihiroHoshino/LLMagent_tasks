Given seekers’ preferences: Seeker_A ranks Company_D 4th; Seeker_B ranks Company_D last; Seeker_C ranks Company_D 4th—so top candidates are unlikely to apply early, but could if rejected elsewhere. Seeker_D ranks Company_D 1st, so rejecting risks losing a guaranteed match, but I can still aim higher early in the process.

Result: shipped on schedule and improved a core KPI (conversion/throughput) with measurable lift while reducing operational overhead through automation.\n• Project 2: Took an underperforming workflow and rebuilt it end-to-end (data/logic + UX + monitoring).
