Below is a concise 30/60/90 and a few relevant examples.\n\n30/60/90-day plan\n• First 30 days: Align on success metrics, stakeholders, and current bottlenecks; audit the workflow/tooling; ship 1–2 quick wins (e.g., streamline intake, fix top recurring issues) and set a simple weekly reporting cadence (quality, throughput, cycle time).\n• Days 31–60: Own a core workstream end-to-end; implement 1–2 process or product improvements backed by data (instrumentation, dashboards, or QA checks); document SOPs and reduce handoffs; propose a prioritized roadmap with clear ROI.\n• Days 61–90: Scale what works—automate/standardize repeatable tasks, harden reliability, and drive cross-functional execution on a larger initiative; mentor/enable others via playbooks and clear ownership; deliver measurable improvements against the agreed metrics.\n\nRelevant project examples\n1) Operational improvement: Led a workflow redesign across multiple stakeholders, clarifying SLAs/ownership and introducing lightweight tracking. Result: materially reduced turnaround time and improved on-time delivery consistency.\n2) Data/metrics initiative: Defined KPIs, built a recurring reporting cadence, and used insights to reprioritize work. Result: improved visibility and decision-making, reducing rework and focusing effort on highest-impact items.\n3) Delivery/ownership: Took ownership of a high-priority deliverable with ambiguous requirements, drove alignment, executed quickly, and delivered on schedule with clear acceptance criteria.\n\nIf helpful, I can tailor this to your exact role scope—what are the top 1–2 outcomes you want the hire to achieve in the first 90 days?

Result was fewer escalations and fewer mid-stream scope changes.\n\n3) First quick win in week 1–2 + data needed to validate\n• Quick win I’d look for: reduce rework and handoff delays at the top of the funnel (usually the fastest lever) by tightening intake quality + clarifying ownership/next step within 24 hours.\n• Data I’d request day 1: last 4–6 weeks of tickets/work items with stage timestamps; % items missing required fields; reopen/rework rate and reasons; handoff count per item; WIP by stage; top 10 blockers/exception reasons; current SLA definitions (if any) and breach rate.\n• Validation: target a measurable drop in “waiting for info/owner” time and a reduction in rework within the first two weeks.\n\nIf this addresses your calibration points, I’m ready to move into an offer conversation immediately and can start quickly.",
