Given quota=1, accepting Seeker_B now would block us from matching with a higher-priority seeker.

              "message": "[TALK] Hi Company_D team—happy to answer the two final prep questions.\n\n1) **How I’d A/B test without slowing the funnel (rollout strategy, guardrails, low-volume codes):**\n- **Rollout strategy:** ship behind a feature flag and start with a **small ramp (e.g., 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)** with daily monitoring; if risk is low, use **sequential ramp** rather than a long A/B to move faster.\n- **Primary success metrics (guardrails):** auth-step completion rate, retry→success rate, time-in-step, time-to-first-value, and downstream activation/retention; guardrails for **support-contact rate**, error recurrence, and latency.\n- **Experiment design:** for high-volume failure modes (timeouts/insufficient_scope/invalid_credentials), run a standard A/B at the step entry level with clear attribution.\n- **Low-volume error codes:** avoid underpowered A/Bs; instead use (a) **pooled analysis** across a “long tail” bucket with consistent UX patterns, (b) **before/after with ramped rollout** + guardrails, and (c) targeted QA + logging to ensure we can still diagnose impact.\n- **Safety valves:** instant rollback via flag if completion drops beyond a threshold (e.g., -1pp absolute) or if support-contact spikes unexpectedly.\n\n2) **Balancing self-serve vs escalate-to-support (reduce abandonment without overloading support):**\n- **Principle:** keep users moving with the **fastest user-fixable path** first; escalate when the probability of self-serve success is low or repeated failure indicates a hard blocker.\n- **Self-serve first (deflection):** permissions/expired token/invalid credentials → show the exact fix (required scopes, reconnect, setup guide) + guided retry.\n- **Escalate intelligently:** config-like issues (e.g., redirect mismatch) or **repeated failures** (e.g., 3 tries, or 2 for config errors) → make **Contact support** primary, prefill payload, and persist a “blocked” state so users don’t loop.\n- **Support load control:** route to **tiered help** (inline checklist → doc → contact) and use failure frequency to adjust thresholds; track **support-contact-per-successful-connection** as a key ops metric.\n- **Outcome focus:** optimize for step completion + time-to-first-value while keeping support-contact rate within an agreed band.\n\nI’ll also bring the one-slide UI progression mock (first failure → repeated failure → support handoff) to the Wed 2:30pm screen. See you then: https://meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij",

I have an active, positive dialogue with them and an upcoming screen; the best move is to keep momentum by answering their two final prep questions with concrete, execution-oriented bullets to maximize acceptance chances. Use [TALK] since they haven’t requested a re-application yet and we’re in pre-screen prep."
