Also improved on-call handoffs because the runbooks and dashboards made triage repeatable.\n\n2) Single-threaded ownership for on-call quality/SLOs:\nYes. I’ve been the DRI for a service/workflow’s on-call health—owning SLO definition, alert tuning, and reliability roadmap, and coordinating fixes across eng + ops. I’m comfortable being accountable for error budgets and making prioritization calls to keep the system stable while still shipping.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share a 1-page outline of how I’d approach the first 30/60 days for the reliability + cycle-time goals you listed.
