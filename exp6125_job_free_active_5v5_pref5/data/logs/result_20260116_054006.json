However, accepting Seeker_C now could block us from matching with Seeker_E or Seeker_B if they apply later. Looking at seekers' preferences: Seeker_E ranks Company_B last, so unlikely to apply to us early (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere; Seeker_B ranks Company_B second (after Company_A), so they may apply to Company_A first; Seeker_D ranks Company_B first and could apply soon; Seeker_C ranks Company_B first and is applying now. Given our goal to match as high as possible, waiting for Seeker_B (higher than Seeker_C) could be beneficial, but uncertain. Since Seeker_C is a strong, top-choice applicant and higher than Seeker_D and Seeker_A, and Seeker_E is unlikely, the risk-adjusted best move is to accept Seeker_C now rather than gamble on Seeker_B applying and being available."

I rewrote the query to batch fetch, added the right composite index, and added a Redis cache for a frequently-requested read path. I also adjusted Kafka consumer retry/backoff to prevent thundering-herd retries during partial outages.\n- Follow-up + measured outcome: Added targeted dashboards/alerts for connection pool saturation and query latency, plus a load test in CI for that endpoint. After rollout, p95 latency returned to baseline and 5xx rate dropped back below alert thresholds; the same traffic pattern has not re-triggered the incident.\n\nIf this aligns with your highest-need area, I’m ready to submit a targeted [APPLY] immediately—just tell me the one area you want emphasized most in the application.",
