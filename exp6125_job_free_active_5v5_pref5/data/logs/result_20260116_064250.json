Accepting Seeker_B now would lock our only slot and prevent matching with E or D if they become available. Since we can only respond to an [APPLY] with [ACCEPT]/[REJECT], and we prefer a higher-priority match, we should reject now to keep capacity for E/D/A.

In this round, only Seeker_A is in our inbox; if we reject, we keep the slot open for Seeker_E or Seeker_D in later rounds. Likelihood: Seeker_E prefers Company_C then D then A; Company_C prioritizes Seeker_B first and Company_D prioritizes Seeker_D first, so Seeker_E may not land C/D and could come to us. Seeker_D prefers B/C/A; Company_B ranks Seeker_D 4th and Company_C ranks Seeker_D 3rd, so Seeker_D might also end up applying to us. Therefore rejecting Seeker_A now increases chance to match with higher-ranked E or D without violating any constraints.
