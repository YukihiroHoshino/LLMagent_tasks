I still have quota 1 and am currently unmatched. However, Seeker_D and Seeker_A are ranked above Seeker_C, and both have Company_D as their last choice, making it unlikely they will apply soon (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere late. Seeker_C ranks Company_D as their #3, so they may accept if I do, but they might also be pursuing Company_B/Company_C first, so delaying could risk losing them. Given the market uncertainty and that Seeker_C is still a high-priority acceptable candidate, accepting now maximizes my chance to fill the role with someone on my list rather than ending unmatched while waiting for unlikely top choices."
