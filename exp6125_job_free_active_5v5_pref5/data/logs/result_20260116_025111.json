Since prior top choices (B, C, A) have rejected me as filled, I should compromise and apply to the best remaining option to secure a match this round.

Also, Seeker_A ranks Company_E 4th but states we are their top remaining choice, indicating high likelihood to commit now. Accepting immediately secures our top candidate and avoids risk of losing them to other companies in subsequent rounds."
