Since Seeker_E is available and has applied directly, accepting Seeker_B now would block a higher-priority match. Given we can only send one response and must decide on Seeker_B’s APPLY now, the optimal move is to reject Seeker_B to preserve the slot for Seeker_E. Also, Seeker_B’s own preferences rank Company_A #1, so they have good outside options but will likely continue pursuing; however, Company_A’s objective is to maximize its own priority match."

Company_A ranks me 1st, and it is 3rd on my true preference list, making it the best high-probability secure match early.

Although Seeker_E ranks Company_A third (after Company_C and Company_D), they are currently applying to us, so an acceptance should lock in the match before they potentially match elsewhere. Seeker_B is lower on our priority list and was previously rejected; even if reconsidered, Seeker_E dominates for our objective. Therefore, accept Seeker_E."

Between them, Seeker_C is higher on our true priority list, so accepting Seeker_C dominates accepting Seeker_D. Holding out for Seeker_E or Seeker_B is risky because Seeker_E ranks Company_B last and Seeker_B ranks Company_A first, so they are unlikely to apply/accept us.
