We have quota 1, so accepting Seeker_E immediately secures our top choice and ends our search. Although Seeker_B also applied and ranks #4 for us (even if Company_A is their top choice), there is no upside in delaying or risking losing Seeker_E to other companies—Seeker_E ranks Company_A third and may receive/accept offers elsewhere (e.g., Company_C is their #1 and Company_C ranks Seeker_E #4).
