Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our list within quota 1, it is better to reject Seeker_B now rather than lock in a lower-priority match immediately."

Company_E ranks me #1, and it is still reasonably high on my true preference list (4th). Securing a match quickly with a company that strongly prioritizes me reduces the risk of ending up with my last choice (Company_D) or unemployed.
