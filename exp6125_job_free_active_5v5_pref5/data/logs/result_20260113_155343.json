Result: time-to-first-value down ~22% and activation up ~11% over 6 weeks.\n\n(2) 0→1 execution: I owned the launch of a lightweight internal KPI dashboard (requirements → data definitions → rollout). I set the metric taxonomy, coordinated data/eng, and drove adoption with a weekly review cadence. Result: reporting time reduced from ~2 days/month to near-real-time; leadership usage became weekly and we retired 3 redundant reports.\n\n(3) Fast scoped win: I identified a high-friction handoff between sales and implementation, proposed a standardized intake + SLA, and implemented it with stakeholders. Result: cycle time reduced ~18% and fewer escalations (qualitatively, but tracked via ticket volume).\n\nRole target: product/ops-style ownership (product/program/strategy & ops), where I can translate business goals into plans/metrics and ship improvements quickly.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re prioritizing, I’d like to apply and move to next steps—happy to go deeper on any example and the decisions/tradeoffs I made.",

Sharing 2 examples where I personally drove alignment across resistant stakeholders, the decision framework, and the measurable outcome:\n\n1) Sales ↔ Implementation handoff (high resistance on both sides)\n- Situation: Sales wanted speed/looser qualification; Implementation wanted stricter intake to reduce thrash. Escalations were rising and no one owned the end-to-end.\n- What I did: I ran a 2-week “alignment sprint” with Sales, Impl, and Ops leads. Decision framework: (a) agree on the single business goal (reduce cycle time without increasing rework), (b) define 3 shared metrics (cycle time, rework rate, escalation volume), (c) map failure modes and pick the smallest policy/process change that moved all 3.\n- Intervention: standardized intake (must-have fields), explicit acceptance criteria, and an SLA with a weekly exception review.\n- Outcome: cycle time down ~18% over the next month; escalations dropped materially (tracked via ticket volume), and we kept a durable weekly operating cadence to prevent backsliding.\n\n2) Onboarding funnel overhaul (Product/Eng/CS misaligned on “what good looks like”)\n- Situation: Product wanted more steps for data capture; CS wanted fewer steps for faster activation; Eng was concerned about scope.\n- What I did: I facilitated a metric-first decision: picked a primary metric (time-to-first-value) + guardrails (activation rate, support contacts), instrumented the funnel, and used a RICE-style prioritization with an explicit tradeoff doc to get sign-off.\n- Execution: shipped two iterations (flow + copy + triggered nudges), reviewed results weekly with stakeholders, and locked in owners for ongoing monitoring.\n- Outcome: time-to-first-value down ~22% and activation up ~11% over ~6 weeks.\n\nIf these map to the cross-functional execution + stakeholder alignment gap you mentioned, I’d really value a quick 20–30 min screen as a contingency. If you tell me the specific “messy, multi-team problem” this role is meant to own, I can also outline how I’d approach the first 30/60 days and what metrics I’d anchor on.",
