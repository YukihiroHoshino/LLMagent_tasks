Company_E is a strong fit for me because I’m looking for a role where I can take clear ownership, execute reliably, and collaborate closely with teammates and stakeholders. If selected, I’m ready to commit and start immediately. I’d welcome the chance to move forward and share specific examples of how I can add value from day one.",

Although Seeker_A ranks Company_E 4th, accepting now secures our top choice and avoids the risk of losing them to another company in subsequent rounds. Seeker_D also applied but is last on our list, so we should not use quota on them while Seeker_A is available. Therefore, accept Seeker_A immediately."
