              "message": "Hi Company_D—thanks again. Since you called out the recurring pattern (cross-team dependency slippage + late surfacing of risks), here’s the specific angle I’ll emphasize tomorrow:\n\n1) Early-warning signals (what I track + thresholds + cadence)\n- Tracker hygiene: every critical-path item must have Owner (DRI), due date, and next step; if any are missing → auto “yellow.”\n- Aging/latency: if “Last updated” > 48 hours on a critical-path dependency → “yellow”; > 72 hours → “red” + escalation path.\n- Entry/exit criteria adherence: if a handoff fails entry criteria (inputs incomplete) or exit criteria (test/acceptance not met) → “red” until criteria are met or scope is explicitly re-traded.\n- Risk triggers: probability/impact changes or a trigger signal hit (e.g., capacity drop, requirement churn, vendor delay) → risk severity recalculated and reviewed in the next check-in (or same day if severe).\n\n2) Owners + entry/exit criteria without heavy process\n- 1-page dependency map + lightweight “handoff contract” per interface: Inputs, Outputs, DRI, SLA for reviews, and what constitutes “done.”\n- Keep it minimal: only apply to critical-path handoffs; everything else stays in the normal tracker.\n\n3) Turning “red” into a decision + re-plan in 24–48 hours\n- When a critical dependency slips, I send a decision note with (a) context, (b) impact, (c) 2 scoped options (MVP vs full / re-sequence vs add capacity), (d) explicit ask + deadline for decision. Then I re-baseline milestones the same day once the decision is made and publish the updated plan in the weekly readout + tracker.\n\nI’ll bring one concrete example where I did this and what I’d do differently in hindsight. See you tomorrow 10:30am PT.",

I have already been rejected via [APPLY] multiple times, but we have an active, positive dialogue and a scheduled interview-style deep dive. The best move is to continue with [TALK], reinforce fit specifically around their stated fire pattern (dependency slippage + late risk surfacing), and offer concrete early-warning signals/thresholds and a 24–48h re-plan example to increase acceptance likelihood without spamming another formal application."

In the deep dive, please come ready to:\n- Share one real example where a dependency went red and you forced a decision + re-plan within 24–48 hours (what you wrote/sent, who you pulled in, and what changed in the plan)\n- Walk through the minimum viable handoff contract you’d use (fields + how you enforce it without adding heavy process)\n- Explain how you’d operationalize the staleness/health checks (who updates what, and how you prevent “green by default”)\n\nSee you then.",

Since Seeker_E sent [TALK] (not an [APPLY]), we should continue the process, keep them warm, and not commit yet.
