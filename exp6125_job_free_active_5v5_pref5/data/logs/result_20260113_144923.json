Requirements were initially unclear across Ops and Eng, so I ran stakeholder interviews, mapped the current-state process, and defined a phased MVP with explicit success metrics. I set a weekly cadence, maintained a single source of truth, and made tradeoffs (cut non-critical automation in v1 to hit the date; documented risks and follow-ups). Outcome: launched on time, improved cycle time meaningfully, and reduced handoff errors; adoption hit target within the first weeks.\n\n2) Stakeholder-heavy execution: I led a project that required coordination across multiple teams with competing priorities. I created a milestone plan, clarified owners, and used lightweight status reporting to surface blockers early. When scope creep appeared, I proposed two options with impact on timeline/quality and aligned leadership on the decision. Outcome: delivered the committed scope, avoided late surprises, and strengthened trust with stakeholders.\n\nI’m excited about the role and confident I can ramp quickly in ambiguity. I’d like to formally apply—happy to share more detail or references if helpful. [APPLY]",

B is our #2 and is currently applying now; B ranks us #2 (after Company_A), so there is a decent chance B could match with A if A prefers B enough, but A’s top choices are E then D then A then B, so A may not take B if higher-ranked seekers apply.
