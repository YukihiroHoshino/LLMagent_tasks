Company_B is the top choice for several seekers and also prioritizes Seeker_E first, so Seeker_E may have strong alternatives, but we can still potentially secure a higher-ranked candidate if we wait.

I’ve consistently delivered end-to-end results under tight timelines, and I’m comfortable operating with ambiguity while keeping quality high. If helpful, I can share 2–3 brief, directly relevant project examples and I’m available to move quickly through next steps. Thank you for your consideration.",
