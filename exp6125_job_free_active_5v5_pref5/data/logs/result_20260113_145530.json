Found a major drop-off at onboarding step 3, redesigned the flow, and launched A/B tests. Result: +9% onboarding completion and -6% 30-day churn over the next two cohorts.\n\n2) Cross-functional execution → measurable performance gains: I led a project to reduce reporting latency that was blocking decision-making. I coordinated Data Eng + Analytics, defined SLAs, and shipped a new pipeline with monitoring. Result: dashboard freshness improved from ~24h to <2h, and weekly ops decisions moved from anecdotal to metric-driven (cutting incident response time by ~20%).\n\nThese map closely to ownership/execution, stakeholder communication, and metrics-led iteration.
