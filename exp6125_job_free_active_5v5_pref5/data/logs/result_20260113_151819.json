Seeker_E (our #1) has not contacted us and ranks Company_A only 3rd, while Seeker_D ranks Company_A 3rd and is actively pursuing us now. Given quota=1 and the risk of losing Seeker_D to Company_B/Company_C (both ranked above us by Seeker_D), accepting Seeker_D now maximizes expected outcome versus waiting for unlikely Seeker_E. Seeker_A is lower priority (#3) and has been rejected before; no better option in inbox this round."
