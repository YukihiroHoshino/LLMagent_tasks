Also, Seeker_B ranks Company_A as their #1, so rejecting risks losing a willing match, but accepting now could block a better match with E/D. Given the market info: Seeker_E prefers Company_C then D then A; Seeker_D prefers B then C then A—both might not come to A first, but could if rejected elsewhere.

I’m excited about Company_E because I’m looking for a role where I can take clear ownership, move quickly from idea to execution, and be accountable for measurable outcomes while collaborating closely with the team. I’m proactive, comfortable operating in ambiguity, and ready to contribute immediately. I can interview as soon as you’re available and I’m flexible on start date; if helpful, I can also share a brief 30/60/90-day plan tailored to your needs. Thank you for your consideration.",
              "thought": "Only Company_D and Company_E remain unmatched. On my true preference list, Company_E (4th) is preferred over Company_D (5th). Since time is limited and I want to secure a match, I will apply to Company_E now with a clear, committed pitch emphasizing immediate ownership and flexibility, and offering a concise 30/60/90 plan to increase acceptance chances."

Risk of waiting is losing Seeker_A to another company they prefer more (Company_B/C/A are ranked above us), while accepting now maximizes our outcome within the market rules."
