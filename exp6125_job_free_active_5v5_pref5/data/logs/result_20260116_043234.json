However, Seeker_B (our top choice) has not applied yet; Seeker_B’s preferences rank Company_C third after Company_A and Company_B, so there is a meaningful chance Seeker_B matches elsewhere if we wait. Seeker_C ranks Company_C second (after Company_B), so if we reject now we may lose Seeker_C to Company_B. Given quota=1 and the goal to match as high as possible on our list within the process, locking in Seeker_C now is a strong outcome (2nd choice) and avoids ending up with a lower-ranked candidate or unfilled role if Seeker_B never becomes available."

However, multiple higher-priority candidates (E/B/C) exist in the market, and at least Seeker_B and Seeker_E do not list Company_B as their top choice (B prefers A first; E ranks B last), so they may not apply soon or at all. Seeker_C ranks Company_B first and may apply, making them a realistic higher-priority option to wait for. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_D now could block a better match if Seeker_C applies later.

Outcome: we shipped on the deadline with no critical regressions and avoided a last-minute slip.\n\n• Cadence that changed behavior (not just dashboards): I set a weekly operating review with a strict decision log + RACI and made it the only forum where priorities changed—anything not in the log didn’t get resourced. To drive adherence, I pre-briefed decision owners, time-boxed debates, and escalated “no-show/no-decision” items within 24 hours with clear options/impacts.
