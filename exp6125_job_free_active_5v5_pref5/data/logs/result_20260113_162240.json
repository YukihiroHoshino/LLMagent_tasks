Result: shipped in 6 weeks and improved the core KPI by ~18% (and reduced manual effort for the team by ~30%).\n\nExecution in ambiguity: I’ve repeatedly taken loosely defined goals and turned them into clear milestones—setting success metrics up front, prioritizing high-leverage work, and communicating tradeoffs early. In one case, I re-scoped a stalled effort into two quick iterations that delivered an initial release in 2 weeks, then expanded based on user feedback.\n\nRole target: I’m aiming for a role where I can own projects/products end-to-end and operate cross-functionally (execution + stakeholder alignment).

Please send the calendar invite when ready.\n\nI’ll come prepared to walk through one end-to-end example (context → ambiguity → defining success/metrics → plan & tradeoffs → execution cadence/stakeholder alignment → results), and I’ll tailor it to your two priorities: (1) driving an ambiguous cross-functional initiative to a shipped outcome, and (2) tightening execution cadence/communications.\n\nIf there’s anything specific you’d like me to bring (doc/metrics/refs) ahead of the chat, tell me and I’ll send it today.",
