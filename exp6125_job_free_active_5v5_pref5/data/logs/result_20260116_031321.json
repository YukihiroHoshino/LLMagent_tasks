Seeker_D also ranks us #1, but is ranked very highly by Company_A (#2) and Company_D (#1), and D’s own preferences place Company_C as #2 and Company_A as #3, so D has strong outside options and may not remain available if we delay. Since Seeker_E (our top choice) and Seeker_B (our #2) did not contact us this round and may be difficult to attract (E ranks us last; B ranks us #2 but may target A first), holding out is risky.
