Given where we are in the process and your stated ability to ramp quickly and drive execution, we’d like to move forward and extend an offer. We’ll follow up with next steps and details to confirm start date and onboarding plan.",
              "thought": "Company_D’s true priority list ranks Seeker_E 4th (above only Seeker_B). We have already rejected Seeker_E twice, indicating we were holding out for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D/Seeker_A/Seeker_C). However, by round 5 we are the only company still active and Seeker_E is repeatedly applying, implying the top candidates are likely matched elsewhere and unavailable. With quota 1, leaving the role unfilled is possible, but given the market appears effectively ended and Seeker_E is on our acceptable list, accepting now secures a hire rather than ending unmatched."
