However, higher-ranked candidates Seeker_E and Seeker_B have not applied yet. Notably, Seeker_B prefers Company_A first, but could come to us if rejected there; Seeker_E ranks us last, so unlikely to apply. Seeker_C ranks Company_B first, so accepting now secures a strong mutual match and avoids risk of losing them to Company_C (their #2) in later rounds.
