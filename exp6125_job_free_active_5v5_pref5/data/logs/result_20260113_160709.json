With quota 1, accepting Seeker_D now would likely block a better match. Reject Seeker_D to preserve capacity for Seeker_B/Seeker_C; Seeker_D can likely match elsewhere since they also rank Company_C highly and multiple companies remain unmatched."

B is ranked higher than C and also has Company_B as their #2 (after Company_A), while C has Company_B as #1. With only 1 quota, the best outcome is to match with the highest-ranked feasible candidate. Since Seeker_B is available and has applied, we should reserve the slot for Seeker_B and reject Seeker_C despite their strong interest.
