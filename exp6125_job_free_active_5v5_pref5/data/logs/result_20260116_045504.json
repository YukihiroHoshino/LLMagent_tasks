Accepting Seeker_D now would prevent matching with Seeker_A and would be strictly worse per our priority list. Therefore we should reject Seeker_D to preserve capacity for higher-ranked candidates, especially Seeker_A who is currently available and interested."

They have applied directly to us and ranked us 4th, but given our ability to accept now and secure top choice, we should lock the match immediately rather than risk them matching elsewhere in later rounds. Seeker_D is last on our list and was previously rejected; no better candidate is currently applying. Therefore accept Seeker_A."
