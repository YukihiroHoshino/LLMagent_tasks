With the market narrowing, I’m focusing on roles where I can take real ownership and deliver measurable outcomes quickly, and Company_E stands out as a place where I can do that with a collaborative team.\n\nMy working style is: align on the goal and success metrics fast, execute end-to-end, communicate progress/tradeoffs clearly, and iterate quickly based on feedback. I’m ready to interview immediately and can start promptly. If we’re aligned, I’m prepared to commit and make Company_E my top choice among the remaining options.\n\nThank you for your consideration — I’d appreciate the chance to speak.",

In this round, Seeker_A (our #1) also applied, so accepting Seeker_D would lock our only quota and prevent matching with a much higher-priority candidate. Given we prefer leaving the role unfilled over hiring off-list (and Seeker_D is on-list but lowest), the optimal move is to reject Seeker_D now and preserve capacity for Seeker_A or other higher-ranked seekers (Seeker_C/Seeker_B/Seeker_E) if they apply later. Seeker_D also ranks Company_E 4th, suggesting higher risk they may later prefer other companies, further reducing the value of accepting them immediately."
