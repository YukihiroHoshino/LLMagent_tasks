Higher-priority seekers (A, C, B) have not engaged with us yet, and our stated strategy throughout has been to hold the slot for those profiles and otherwise leave it unfilled rather than reopen to lower-priority candidates. In this round, the only inbound is Seeker_E with a TALK message reiterating they will step back. Accepting or reopening now would contradict our repeated commitments and reduce our chance to match with a higher-priority candidate should they engage in remaining rounds. Therefore, maintain the same stance and respond with TALK, confirming no change and that we will reach out proactively if anything changes."
