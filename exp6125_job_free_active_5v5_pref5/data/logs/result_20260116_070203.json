Seeker_C also ranks Company_C as their #2 (after Company_B), so delaying could cause them to accept Company_B if available.

If/when you see one of those objective signals (a genuinely new/re-posted req or a new Platform/SRE/Data/ML Platform posting), the clean path is to apply directly to that specific posting.",

Only Seeker_E is contacting us in round 30, and they are 4th on our list; however, the current seat is strictly tied to a specific profile and we have repeatedly communicated we will not reconsider Seeker_E for this req this cycle unless a genuinely refreshed/re-posted req appears. Seeker_E is not applying, only talking. At round 30 the simulation ends; maintaining consistency and avoiding a last-minute reversal that contradicts stated constraints is optimal. Respond with confirmation and closure guidance; no accept/reject needed because it’s [TALK]."
