Still, by round 15 we have no other inbound applicants, and waiting for Seeker_D or Seeker_A (our top two) is risky because they both rank Company_D last and may never apply. Given quota=1 and Seeker_C’s explicit commitment to accept immediately, accepting now secures a reasonably high-priority candidate and avoids ending unmatched."
