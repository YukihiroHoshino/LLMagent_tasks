Per your note, here are two comparable end-to-end projects with scope, stakeholders, and measurable outcomes.\n\n1) Ambiguous cross-functional launch (ownership + stakeholder management)\n- Problem: A critical workflow was causing drop-offs and support escalations, but ownership was fragmented across Product, Eng, Ops, and Support.\n- My role: Led discovery → alignment → execution as the single DRI. Defined success metrics, wrote the PRD, ran weekly exec/working-group updates, and unblocked engineering/ops dependencies.\n- Stakeholders: Product, Engineering, Data, Ops, Support, and a Sales lead for customer comms.\n- Results: Reduced workflow drop-off by ~18% and cut related support tickets by ~25% within ~6 weeks of rollout (measured via funnel + ticket tagging). Shipped in two phases to de-risk.\n- What I’d do differently: Pull data instrumentation earlier (week 1) to shorten iteration cycles and reduce debate over root cause.\n\n2) Process + tooling improvement (independent execution, measurable outcomes)\n- Problem: High variance in cycle time for a recurring operational process; handoffs were unclear and rework was common.\n- My role: Mapped the process, identified top failure points, implemented a lightweight intake/triage rubric + dashboard, and set SLAs with owners. Drove adoption through training and weekly reviews until stable.\n- Stakeholders: Ops managers, Engineering (light tooling), Analytics, and frontline users.\n- Results: Improved median cycle time by ~30% and reduced rework by ~20% over ~2 months; also improved predictability (fewer outliers) which helped planning.\n- What I’d do differently: Involve frontline reps earlier in rubric design to increase buy-in and reduce initial friction.\n\nI can operate independently and ramp quickly, and I’m happy to share a 1-page write-up or walk through either example live.
