Based on seekers' preferences, Seeker_B prefers A then B then C (so could come to us if rejected elsewhere), Seeker_C prefers B then C (good chance to approach us), and Seeker_D prefers B then C (also possible).

However, Seeker_E is my top choice and may apply elsewhere first (their top choice is Company_C, and Company_C’s top is Seeker_B), so there is a plausible path where Seeker_E does not end up with Company_C and could later approach Company_B. Still, holding out risks ending unmatched if Seeker_E never applies, while Seeker_C is a strong, high-ranked option who is explicitly prioritizing Company_B.
