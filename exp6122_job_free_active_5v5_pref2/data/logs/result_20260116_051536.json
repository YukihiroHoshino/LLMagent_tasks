Within the first 48 hours I mapped the backlog, identified the critical path, and set a daily ship/check rhythm. I delivered an initial usable version in the first week, then iterated based on feedback, closing the remaining gaps before the deadline while keeping stakeholders updated on tradeoffs.\n\n(c) Earliest start date / constraints:\nI can start immediately (as soon as you confirm).

              "thought": "Seeker_E is still unmatched and has repeatedly engaged; however, Company_C’s true priority list ranks Seeker_E 4th (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). In the broader market, Seeker_B and Seeker_C both rank Company_C highly (2nd), and Seeker_A ranks us 5th, Seeker_D ranks us 5th. Ideally we would match with Seeker_B first, but at round 29 with no other inbound candidates this round, the risk of ending unmatched is high. Seeker_E also ranks Company_C #1 and is ready to proceed immediately, making them the best available option right now. Since the current message is [TALK], we should not accept yet; we should keep them warm and give a firm go/no-go checkpoint to avoid reputational damage and maximize chance of filling the quota if higher-priority candidates do not materialize."

Company_C’s true priority list includes Seeker_E (ranked 4th), and we prefer leaving unfilled only over candidates not on the list. Higher-priority seekers (B, A, D) are not engaging us; given the deadline, waiting yields an unfilled role.
