If not, I appreciate the clarity and won’t keep re-applying.\n\nThank you for your time.",

Given our remaining quota is 1, we’re being careful not to fill it until we’re confident those options are no longer realistically available.\n\nI don’t want to keep you in a loop: at this moment, a new 1-page write-up is unlikely to change the decision immediately. If the market remains stalled and it becomes clear those higher-priority candidates won’t materialize, we may reopen consideration—at which point I will explicitly let you know and invite a final application update.\n\nIf you’d like, you can reply with a one-paragraph summary of the single most relevant project to our problem area (what you shipped + metric impact). I can keep it on file in case we pivot later, but I want to set expectations that we are not ready to move to an offer right now.",

However, accepting E now would permanently forgo any chance (even if small) of landing B/A/D later within the 30-round horizon. Since Seeker_E is only [TALK] (not forcing an accept/reject) and is asking for clarity, the best move is to be transparent that we are holding for higher-priority candidates, while keeping a door open if the market stalls near the end; continue [TALK] rather than accept."

Per your note, here’s a one-paragraph summary of my single most relevant end-to-end project to your problem area, to keep on file:\n\nI led a 0→1 launch of a workflow/product improvement aimed at reducing a key funnel drop-off: defined the problem and success metrics with stakeholders, wrote the requirements, coordinated design/engineering execution, shipped in ~8 weeks, and then ran two rapid post-launch iterations based on instrumentation and user feedback. The result was ~18% improvement in the primary KPI within the first month, plus a ~14% reduction in time-to-complete for the core task.\n\nIf helpful, could you share what specific signal would indicate your higher-priority candidates are no longer realistically available (e.g., after X rounds/time), and when you expect to make a final fill decision?
