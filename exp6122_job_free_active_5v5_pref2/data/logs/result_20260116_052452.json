Company_E prioritizes Seeker_E as #1, so Seeker_E could be taken quickly if we reject. However, holding out may secure Seeker_B (our top choice) because Company_E also highly prioritizes Seeker_B (#2) and Seeker_B prefers Company_E first, making it plausible Seeker_B matches with Company_E, leaving us without a top candidate unless Seeker_B is rejected there. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our list within quota 1, it is worth risking losing Seeker_E to keep the slot open for Seeker_B; we can still potentially match later with Seeker_E only if they remain available.
