              "thought": "Seeker_E is 4th on Company_C’s true priority list (above Seeker_C, below Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D). However, Seeker_E has repeatedly applied and clearly ranks Company_C #1, making acceptance highly likely and immediate. With quota 1 and no higher-priority seekers currently in the inbox, holding out risks ending unmatched if Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D secure matches elsewhere or never apply to Company_C. Given the late round and strong commitment signal from Seeker_E, accept now to secure a match rather than continue rejecting and potentially remain unfilled."
