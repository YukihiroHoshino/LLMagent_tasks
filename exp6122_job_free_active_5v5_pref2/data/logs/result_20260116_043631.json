              "message": "Hi Company_C—Seeker_E here. Thank you again for the candid feedback. Per your suggestion, here’s a short, targeted 5-bullet mapping to the “must-haves” profile you described (highly direct, role-specific, immediate-impact):\n\n• Immediate ramp: I’m comfortable owning a scoped workstream end-to-end in week 1–2 (requirements → execution → handoff), with tight feedback loops and minimal supervision.\n• Role-specific execution: I’ve done repeated, similar-to-this-seat work where success was measured by fast, concrete deliverables (not exploratory projects), and I can share a concise portfolio/write-up if useful.\n• Stakeholder clarity: I’m practiced at translating ambiguous asks into crisp specs, aligning stakeholders quickly, and documenting decisions to keep pace high.\n• Quality under speed: I use lightweight checklists/QA to avoid rework while moving fast (clear acceptance criteria, small milestones, early demos).\n• Reliability: I’m ready to commit immediately and prioritize this role as my top choice.\n\nTwo quick questions: (1) Is there a single non-negotiable requirement I still clearly don’t meet (so I can stop pursuing respectfully), or is it more a relative ranking versus other candidates? (2) If it’s relative ranking, is there any additional evidence (work sample, reference, short exercise) that could realistically change the decision?\n\nAppreciate your time either way.",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched and it is my #1 true preference. I have been rejected multiple times, and Company_C indicated they might keep a short targeted summary on file though it won’t guarantee moving forward. Since applying again is unlikely to change the decision without new evidence, I will send a [TALK] message with a concise 3–5 bullet mapping to must-haves and ask if any single gap is still a hard blocker or if there is any scenario (timeline/conditions) under which they would reconsider."

              "message": "Hi Seeker_E—thank you for sending the mapping; it’s clear and thoughtful.\n\nOn your questions:\n\n1) It’s not one single “hard no” non-negotiable like eligibility or availability. The gap is that we’re prioritizing very specific, directly comparable evidence of having done this exact kind of work recently and repeatedly (same scope, same tooling/process, similar constraints), and we don’t currently have enough concrete proof of that match.\n\n2) It’s primarily relative ranking versus the profile we’re holding out for. That said, there *is* evidence that could realistically change things—specifically:\n- One tightly scoped work sample/portfolio item that is clearly analogous (what you owned, constraints, artifacts/deliverables, timeline, and measurable outcome), ideally in a 1–2 page write-up.\n- 1 reference (name + context) who can quickly confirm you’ve executed this kind of work end-to-end under tight timelines.\n\nIf you can share those, we’ll review, but I want to be transparent: given how strict we’re being for this seat, it still may not result in moving forward.\n\nIf you’d like, send the single best work sample write-up and the reference context, and we’ll take one more look this week.",
              "thought": "Company_C’s true priority ranks Seeker_E 4th (ahead of only Seeker_C). We have repeatedly rejected Seeker_E’s prior APPLY attempts, signaling we are holding out for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D). Given the market context (we appear to be the only company still unmatched) there is a possibility those higher-priority seekers are already matched elsewhere, but accepting Seeker_E now would forfeit any chance to match with a higher-priority seeker if one becomes available later. Since Seeker_E is currently [TALK] (not forcing an accept/reject) and we want to preserve optionality while being honest and respectful, we should respond with [TALK], clarify that the gap is role-specific proof rather than generic traits, and offer a concrete, bounded evidence request (work sample + brief reference) while setting expectations that it’s unlikely to change the decision."
