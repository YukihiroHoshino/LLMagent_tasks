Seeker_E did not contact us and, per Seeker_E’s preferences, Company_E is their last choice, so the probability of obtaining Seeker_E later is low. Seeker_B has Company_E as their top choice and is applying now, so accepting secures a very high-priority candidate (2nd overall) with strong commitment.

              "thought": "Seeker_E is 4th on our true priority list (B, A, D, E, C). Our quota is 1 and we strongly prefer holding for higher-priority candidates if there is still a realistic chance they may apply. However, after 16 rounds we have received no outreach from Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D to Company_C, and Seeker_E has repeatedly demonstrated strong commitment and willingness to accept immediately. Given the late stage and the risk of ending unmatched, accepting Seeker_E now secures a filled role with an eager candidate rather than continuing to wait indefinitely for higher-ranked seekers who have not engaged us."
