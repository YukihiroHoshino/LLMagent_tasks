Thank you for your consideration. [APPLY]",

In this round I received [APPLY] from Seeker_B, Seeker_A, and Seeker_D. Seeker_B is the highest-ranked among current applicants (only Seeker_E would be preferred, but Seeker_E’s preferences rank Company_E last, making it unlikely they will apply/accept). Seeker_B ranks Company_E as their top choice, so accepting now secures a highly preferred, stable match and avoids the risk of losing them to other companies (Company_A and Company_C rank Seeker_B #1). With quota 1, it is optimal to accept Seeker_B immediately rather than wait for an unlikely Seeker_E application."

If we reject now to wait for higher-priority candidates, we risk losing our slot entirely because Seeker_B ranks us #2 (may go to Company_E first), Seeker_A ranks us last, and Seeker_D ranks us last; they are unlikely to apply to us early, if at all.
