I owned requirements, coordinated Eng/Product/Ops, implemented event tracking + dashboards, and drove weekly experiment iterations; the changes (simplified flow, better prompts, and faster follow-up) lifted activation by ~25% in one quarter.\n\nIf your situation opens up, I’m available for that 15-minute chat same-day and can start immediately.",

Maintain a simple “exclusion list” table and apply it consistently in the funnel queries.\n- **Tracking health check (weekly, lightweight)**:\n  - volume sanity: total events by type vs prior week (alerts on large deltas)\n  - coverage: % of signups with required identifiers (user_id, created_at) and expected onboarding events\n  - schema/version drift: monitor key properties (e.g., channel, device, persona) for null rate spikes\n  - sample validation: spot-check 10–20 recent user journeys end-to-end (signup → setup → aha) to confirm ordering and timestamps look right.\n\n**(2) Handling users who do “Aha” before setup (ordering logic)**\n- I’d treat this as a **separate path** rather than forcing a strict linear funnel, because it’s a meaningful behavior signal (some users may reach value without completing the formal setup).\n- Concretely, I’d report:\n  - **Linear funnel** (Setup → Aha): Step2 counted as “Aha within 7 days *and after first setup_completed*” for Setup→Aha conversion.\n  - **Alternate path**: **Aha-first rate** = users who complete Aha within 7 days **before** setup (or with no setup) / signups.\n  - **Total activation**: users who complete Aha within 7 days regardless of setup ordering / signups.\n- On the dashboard, I’d show **Aha-first as a breakdown** so we can decide whether to (a) streamline setup, (b) reposition setup as optional, or (c) guide users from Aha-first into completing setup for longer-term retention.\n\nSee you Tue 2:30–2:45pm ET.",

This is exactly the kind of concrete, week-1 plan we wanted to see.\n\nYour two interventions for the Setup→Aha gap (opinionated post-setup “next best action” + triggered guidance for stalled users) are well-scoped, and I like the explicit guardrails (repeat-aha within 14 days + “empty setup” check). The instrumentation/trust plan (named DRI + weekly tracking health + versioned metrics contract) also directly addresses the stakeholder concern.\n\nNo further prep needed—let’s keep **Tue 2:30–2:45pm ET** as planned. On the call, I’ll ask you to (1) pick one of the two interventions and outline the exact experiment design (variants, eligibility, success/guardrail metrics, minimum runtime), and (2) walk through how you’d roll out the metrics contract with Eng/Product in the first week.\n\nOn our side, we’re still finishing up with a couple candidates who are higher on our current priority list; we should have a clearer signal around Tue/early this week, and at minimum we’ll be able to tell you where things stand and what the next step would be.\n\n[TALK]",

Here are my prep answers for Tue.\n\n1) **Eligibility rule for the Next Best Action CTA (opinionated but not wrong):**\n- **Default-for-all, with a lightweight “escape hatch.”** Show one primary CTA that routes to the most common shortest-path-to-value flow (based on aggregate conversion), **but** include a secondary link: “Not your goal? Choose a different first task” (opens 2–3 options).\n- If we have a reliable early signal, I’d add a simple rule: **persona/company-size (or use-case selection during signup) → CTA variant**. If we don’t have that signal cleanly, I’d start with the default + escape hatch to avoid misrouting.\n\n2) **Single most important guardrail to avoid forced clicks (beyond outcome_viewed):**\n- **Repeat value / sustained usage proxy:** % of users who complete a **second core action** (or return and complete core action again) within **7–14 days**. This catches “one-and-done” behavior where users click through but don’t actually get durable value.\n- If we need a faster guardrail while waiting for 7–14 day data: **core-action error/abandon rate** (started-but-not-succeeded) to ensure we’re not pushing users into a path that increases frustration.\n\nStill holding Tue 2:30–2:45pm ET and ready to move quickly if you get the green light.",
