Although Seeker_E is our top choice, Seeker_E did not contact us this round and in their preferences Company_E is last, making it unlikely we can secure them.

Here are quick, concrete answers:\n\n1) Cross-functional project example + handling misalignment/blockers:\nI led an end-to-end rollout of a new intake + prioritization process for customer-reported issues across Support, Eng, and Product. The main misalignment was Support pushing for speed/volume while Eng wanted fewer, higher-signal tickets. I set up a lightweight weekly triage with explicit decision rights, created a shared rubric (severity, revenue impact, reproducibility), and added a “definition of ready” checklist so tickets arrived with the needed context. When blockers hit (ownership gaps and slow responses), I used a single-threaded owner model per issue, established SLAs for handoffs, and published a simple dashboard so delays were visible. Result: faster resolution on top issues, fewer back-and-forth cycles, and clearer prioritization.\n\n2) Role/team environment where I do my best work:\nI’m at my best on teams that value end-to-end ownership, clear goals/metrics, and an operating cadence with fast unblock paths. I like ambiguity as long as we can align on a plan, instrument outcomes, and iterate with tight feedback loops.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re looking for, I’d love to formally apply and move quickly.
