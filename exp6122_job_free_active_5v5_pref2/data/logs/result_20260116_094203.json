Define success metrics and baseline.\n2) Execution plan (Days 6–10): Propose a simplified workflow (single intake template, weekly prioritization, clear DRI per item, definition of done). Socialize with key stakeholders; lock decision rights.\n3) Deliver MVP outcomes (Days 11–30): Run 2 execution sprints on the highest-impact items; publish a weekly status + risk log; implement a dependency “unblock” routine (48-hour SLA for escalations).\n\nDays 31–60 (Scale + Harden + Prove Repeatability):\n1) Expand to broader set of requests; refine prioritization rubric (impact, effort, risk).\n2) Harden measurement: dashboard + retro cadence; document playbook.\n3) Train/hand off components to ensure repeatable process beyond my direct involvement.\n\nMetrics I’d move (2–3):\n1) Cycle time: reduce median intake→ship by 20–30% by day 60.\n2) On-time delivery: increase % of commitments met from baseline to +15–25 pts.\n3) Stakeholder satisfaction: weekly pulse (e.g., 1–5) improve by +0.5–1.0.\n\nKey risks/dependencies + mitigations:\n- Misaligned priorities across stakeholders → Mitigate via explicit decision-maker, weekly prioritization meeting, and written tradeoffs.\n- Hidden cross-team dependencies → Mitigate via dependency mapping in week 1, clear owners, and escalation SLA.\n- Metric gaming / wrong targets → Mitigate via baseline + guardrails (quality checks, post-ship outcomes review).\n\nIf helpful, I can tailor this to a specific team/workstream you’re hiring for—if you share the area, I’ll adapt the plan and metrics in a follow-up.

Also, Seeker_E’s preferences rank Company_C #1, so they will likely continue to engage, but we must decide on this [APPLY] now; given our objective to match as high as possible on our list, we should reject and keep the seat open for B/A/D."

Scope covered intake/prioritization, dependency management across 3 functions, sprint execution, and weekly exec-level status/risk reporting.\n\n2) Concrete dependency I unblocked: We were stuck waiting on an upstream data instrumentation change owned by another team, which was blocking a key KPI dashboard and delaying two downstream launches. I (a) clarified the exact acceptance criteria and reduced the request to the smallest viable change, (b) secured a named DRI and a 48-hour decision window via the shared stakeholder forum, and (c) offered a parallel path by drafting the spec + test plan and coordinating a short working session to remove ambiguity. Outcome: the upstream team shipped the change within 5 business days (original estimate was ~2–3 weeks), unblocking the dashboard and allowing the downstream launches to ship the following sprint.\n\nIf your pipeline situation changes, I can make myself available immediately for a fast final conversation and can tailor a 30/60-day plan to the specific workstream you need covered.",
