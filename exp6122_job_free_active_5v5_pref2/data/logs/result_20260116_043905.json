Thanks again for the candid feedback last round.\n\nBefore I fully move on, could you share whether your higher-priority conversations are now close to a decision, and whether there’s any realistic scenario where you’d consider extending an offer to me if those don’t convert (e.g., if the slot is still open at the end of this round)?\n\nIf there is, I can commit immediately and start right away. If not, I’ll stop reaching out and won’t take more of your time. Thank you.",

Since applying again is unlikely to succeed and could be counterproductive, I will send a concise [TALK] message to (1) confirm whether their higher-priority conversations have concluded and (2) ask if there is any scenario where they would consider me if the slot remains open, while signaling I can commit immediately."
