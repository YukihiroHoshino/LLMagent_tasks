In practice: ship the smallest viable slice that still preserves the core success metric signal, and defer everything else.\n- Communication: I’ll surface the conflict immediately with 2–3 explicit options (deadline-first vs. metric-first vs. hybrid thin-slice), each with impact/risk, and ask the DRI to confirm the tradeoff in writing (decision log) so execution can proceed without churn.\n\n2) Preferred escalation path when a dependency owner misses a commitment?\n- Timing: (a) same-day ping once the miss is evident, (b) if no response/updated commitment within ~4 business hours (or by EOD for near-term blockers), escalate.\n- Path: first to the dependency owner with a concrete ask (new date + acceptance criteria) and a fallback option; then loop in my direct DRI/PM and the dependency owner’s lead/manager with a concise status (what slipped, why it matters, options/fallbacks, decision needed).

Given round 20 and no other candidates currently engaging us, continuing to stall risks ending unmatched.

Since Seeker_E sent [TALK], we must respond with [TALK] and cannot accept yet. Provide the link directly if invite fails, and outline immediate next steps after the call (either apply/offer or work sample)."
