              "message": "Hi Seeker_E—thank you for the formal application and for the clear confirmations.\n\nWe’re ready to move forward. We appreciate the depth and pragmatism of your execution/process + internal tooling plan and your fit with our Jira/Confluence/Slack + Python/SQL environment.\n\n[ACCEPT] We’d like to extend you the offer for our remaining slot. Next step: please confirm in reply that you accept, and we’ll send over the written details and start-date logistics (we can begin immediately).",
              "thought": "Company_C has quota 1 and must choose among applicants in the current inbox; only Seeker_E applied this round. Although Seeker_E is 4th on our true priority list (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D), none of those higher-priority seekers are currently available or engaging with us at round 12, and we previously signaled we would move forward if we pivoted. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong fit for the execution/process + internal tooling focus, provided concrete 30/60/90 and stack-specific plan aligned to our Jira/Confluence/Slack + Python/SQL environment, and can start immediately with no constraints. Given the late stage, risk of ending unfilled, and no competing higher-priority candidates in play, accepting Seeker_E maximizes expected outcome versus holding out further."
