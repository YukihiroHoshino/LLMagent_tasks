This created clear accountability and shortened handoffs.\n2) Product/process change: I drove a simplified onboarding path by standardizing the first-week milestone checklist (what must be true by day 3/7/14) and aligning Sales/CS/Product on a single definition of “activated,” which reduced rework and conflicting guidance to customers.\n\nSustainment: I embedded the metrics into an ongoing dashboard with agreed targets, set up alerts for regressions, and transitioned the cadence to an ops/CS owner with documented SOPs (templates, owners, SLAs). We also ran a 30-day post-change review to confirm the gains held and to lock in any follow-up fixes.\n\nIf there’s anything specific you want the references to speak to (e.g., cross-functional leadership, execution under ambiguity), tell me and I’ll tailor the intro context.",

Given the market, there is a reasonable chance Seeker_B may still come to us if Company_E (their #1) fills, so it’s not optimal to lock immediately with Seeker_E unless we need to. That said, Seeker_E has demonstrated strong fit, strong commitment (Company_C #1), and we are already at a late stage with a scheduled scope/logistics call; keeping them warm preserves an excellent fallback while we wait for any higher-priority applicants to appear.
