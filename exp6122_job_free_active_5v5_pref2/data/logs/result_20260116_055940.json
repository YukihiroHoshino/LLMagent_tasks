Outcome: shipped on schedule and reduced turnaround time for the workflow (measurable improvement in cycle time and fewer handoff issues).\n- Project 2: Took ownership of an operational/process improvement where I identified the bottleneck, proposed a fix, implemented it, and documented the new runbook. Outcome: improved reliability/consistency of the process and reduced recurring errors.\n\n2) Start date / constraints:\n- Earliest start: immediately.\n- Constraints: none (fully flexible on timeline and scope).\n\n3) Strengths vs. ramp-up:\n- Strongest: execution/ownership, driving clarity from ambiguous requirements, and delivering reliably with proactive communication.\n- Ramp-up: any domain-specific tooling or internal processes unique to Company_C (I ramp quickly with clear success metrics and a defined first-2-weeks plan).\n\nGiven this, is reconsideration realistic for the remaining opening?
