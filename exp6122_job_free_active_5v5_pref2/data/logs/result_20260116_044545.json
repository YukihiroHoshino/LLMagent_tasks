Yes to both: I can submit a formal application now and I’m available for a 15–20 minute call within the next 48 hours (today/tomorrow—please send a couple of slots and I’ll confirm immediately).\n\nOne-paragraph plan (shipping 1–2 concrete deliverables fast): In week 1, I’ll align with you on the single highest-impact outcome, define a tight success metric, map dependencies/risks, and turn it into a 2–3 week execution plan with clear owners and checkpoints. Weeks 2–4, I’ll drive delivery via a lightweight cadence (daily async updates + 2x/week decision/blocked review), aggressively de-risking by front-loading unknowns, cutting scope to an MVP when needed, and escalating decisions early. By days 30–60, I’ll ship deliverable #1 to production (or equivalent launch) with measurable impact, then immediately roll learnings into deliverable #2, documenting the playbook (milestones, handoffs, QA/release checklist) so the team can repeat the cycle faster.\n\nCompany_C remains my #1, and if you give the go/no-go checkpoint by end of next round as noted, I’m ready to move immediately on my side.",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched and it is my #1 choice. Company_C has indicated I’m their leading fallback and asked me to (1) confirm I can submit a formal application and do a 15–20 minute call within 48 hours, and (2) send a one-paragraph plan. To maximize my chance of securing the match this round, I should send a strong but concise plan and formally apply, emphasizing speed and commitment."

Please consider this an acceptance of your application.\n\nNext steps: please share (1) two 15–20 minute time slots in the next 48 hours for a quick kickoff call, and (2) your preferred email/phone for sending the written offer details. We’ll aim to finalize everything immediately after that call.",
              "thought": "Company_C’s true priority list is B > A > D > E > C, so Seeker_E is 4th-choice. However, by round 6 we have no other inbound from higher-priority seekers, and Seeker_E is explicitly #1 for Company_C and ready to move immediately—high acceptance certainty. Waiting risks ending unmatched if higher-priority candidates never apply/accept. Given quota=1 and Seeker_E’s strong commitment, accept now to secure a match rather than hold out indefinitely."
