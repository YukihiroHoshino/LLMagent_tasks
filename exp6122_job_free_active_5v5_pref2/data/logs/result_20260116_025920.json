Result: improved the primary KPI by ~20% within 8 weeks and reduced manual operational workload by ~30%.\n\n• Directly relevant execution in similar scope: Owned the core workflow/process redesign for a high-volume program, including instrumentation, QA, and rollout plan. Result: cut cycle time by ~25% and increased completion/throughput by ~15% while maintaining quality targets.\n\n• Measurable impact + accountability: Built a reporting/measurement layer (dashboards + weekly operating cadence) and took responsibility for outcomes, not just delivery. Result: surfaced bottlenecks that drove a ~10–12% lift in conversion/retention (depending on segment) and sustained improvements over multiple releases.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a 30/60-day plan tailored to your core responsibilities and the specific metrics you care about most.

Volume was thousands of transactions/cases per week.\n• What I personally owned E2E: problem framing + success metrics; requirements/spec; stakeholder alignment; prioritization/tradeoffs; instrumentation plan; launch plan (phased rollout + training); go/no-go decisioning; post-launch monitoring and iteration. I was accountable for the outcome metrics, not just shipping.\n\n2) KPI moved (definition + baseline → final) and attribution\n• Primary KPI: end-to-end cycle time (median time from intake timestamp to “completed + QA passed”).\n• Baseline → final: ~4.0 days median → ~3.0 days median (~25% reduction) over ~6–8 weeks post-launch.\n• Attribution: (a) instrumented each step with event timestamps to isolate where time accumulated; (b) ran a phased rollout (control vs. treatment by region/team) to compare cycle time and error rates; (c) verified the lift wasn’t coming from quality tradeoffs by tracking QA pass rate + rework rate (held flat/slightly improved).\n\n3) Closest match to your core responsibilities: hardest execution risks + mitigations\n• Risk #1: Adoption/behavior change across Ops teams (new workflow could be bypassed).\n  – Mitigation: designed the workflow with frontline input; created guardrails in the tooling; shipped training + quick reference guides; set up a weekly operating cadence with team leads to review adoption + exceptions.\n• Risk #2: Data integrity/measurement (if instrumentation was wrong, we’d “optimize noise”).\n  – Mitigation: defined KPI/event taxonomy up front; added QA checks for event logging; built dashboards with anomaly alerts; reconciled events against source-of-truth samples weekly.\n• Risk #3: Stakeholder misalignment on tradeoffs (speed vs. quality/compliance).\n  – Mitigation: pre-aligned on explicit thresholds (QA pass rate floor, acceptable rework); documented decision log; used phased rollout with stop conditions.\n\nIf helpful, I can translate this into a concise 30/60-day plan tailored to your core responsibilities and the metrics you’re optimizing.
