Given quota=1 and early round, it’s optimal to keep Seeker_E warm while not committing, in case higher-priority seekers (especially Seeker_B who ranks Company_C 2nd, or Seeker_C who ranks Company_C 2nd) approach soon. Since no application is made yet, respond with [TALK], provide info, and invite them to apply while buying time to see if higher-priority candidates appear."

I’m ready to formally apply.\n\nProject highlights (impact-focused):\n1) Owned an ambiguous, cross-functional launch from discovery → delivery: aligned Product/Eng/Ops on scope and success metrics, drove execution through weekly stakeholder reviews, and shipped on schedule. Result: improved key funnel conversion by ~18% and reduced cycle time by ~25% through clearer requirements and tighter iteration loops.\n2) Led a process + tooling improvement initiative: identified bottlenecks, implemented lightweight automation and dashboards, and standardized handoffs across teams. Result: reduced manual workload by ~30% and improved SLA adherence from ~82% to ~95%.\n\nI’m particularly excited about Company_C because I enjoy high-ownership work with measurable outcomes and frequent stakeholder collaboration.

Company_E’s top priorities include Seeker_E and Seeker_B, so Seeker_B is likely to go to Company_E first and may be accepted there; Seeker_E ranks us #1 and is likely to accept immediately. Waiting risks ending unmatched if Seeker_B goes elsewhere and Seeker_A/Seeker_D won’t target us. Seeker_C ranks us #2 but we rank Seeker_C last.
