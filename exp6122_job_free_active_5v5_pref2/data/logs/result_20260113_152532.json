Although Company_C ranks me 4th, applying early gives me a chance if higher-priority candidates go elsewhere (notably Seeker_B prefers Company_E first, and Seeker_A prefers Company_E/B ahead of C). I will make a direct, enthusiastic application emphasizing fit and readiness to commit."

              "thought": "Seeker_E is on our true priority list but ranks 4th (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). In round 1, it’s likely higher-priority candidates will apply elsewhere first: Seeker_B’s #2 is Company_C (after Company_E), Seeker_A ranks us last, Seeker_D ranks us last. Company_E will likely take Seeker_B or Seeker_E (it ranks Seeker_E #1, Seeker_B #2). If we reject Seeker_E now, we may lose a strong, committed candidate who has us as #1, and there’s no guarantee Seeker_B will come to us if Company_E accepts them. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_E secures a match with a ranked candidate and avoids ending unmatched."

              "thought": "Company_D’s true priority list ranks Seeker_C as #2 (behind Seeker_A). However, Seeker_C has Company_D as their #1 choice and has already applied in round 1, making acceptance highly likely to secure a strong match immediately. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_D only #3 and may apply to Company_E or Company_B first; those firms also rank Seeker_A highly, so Company_D could lose them. With quota 1 and only Seeker_C in the inbox this round, accepting Seeker_C locks in a top-tier candidate and avoids the risk of ending unmatched or with a lower-priority option later."

Seeker_A is also #1 for Company_E, but accepting Seeker_A now would forgo the higher-priority Seeker_B (and possibly Seeker_E later).
