Seeker_E has applied repeatedly and remains committed, but our stated strategy has been to hold the slot for higher-priority candidates. Given we prefer leaving unfilled over hiring outside the list (and Seeker_E is on-list but not top), the decision hinges on whether higher-priority candidates are likely to become available to us. In this market, Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 and may come to us if Company_E doesn’t take them; Seeker_A ranks us last; Seeker_D ranks us last; so only Seeker_B is plausibly reachable. Since we are still early (round 6/30), it is rational to continue waiting for Seeker_B rather than lock in Seeker_E now."
