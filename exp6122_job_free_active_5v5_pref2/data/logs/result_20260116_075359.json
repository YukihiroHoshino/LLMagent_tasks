On Company_E’s true priority list, Seeker_B is ranked #2, Seeker_A #3, and Seeker_D #4. Since higher-ranked acceptable candidates (B and A) are available right now and would fill our only slot, accepting Seeker_D would be suboptimal. Therefore, reject Seeker_D to preserve capacity for a higher-priority match. This is also safe because Seeker_D has other options (Company_A is #2 for them) and we can pursue/accept Seeker_B (who also ranks us #1)."

Seeker_E (our top choice) has not applied and ranks Company_E last, so unlikely to come. If we delay, we risk losing Seeker_B to other companies (Seeker_B also ranks Company_C second, and Company_A ranks Seeker_B first).

Seeker_C has applied and states Company_D is their top choice, making acceptance likely to lock in a stable match immediately. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky: Seeker_A prefers Company_E then B then D, so they may not apply to us soon and could match elsewhere. No other inbound messages this round.

              "thought": "Seeker_E is 4th on Company_C’s true priority list (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). However, in this round only Seeker_E applied to us. Given Seeker_E ranks Company_C as their #1 choice, accepting would lock in a match with high likelihood of commitment. Waiting to try for higher-ranked candidates is risky because Seeker_B prefers Company_E first (and Company_E ranks Seeker_B highly), Seeker_A ranks Company_C last, and Seeker_D ranks Company_C last—so our chances of attracting/landing those higher-priority seekers are low. With quota 1, the expected value favors accepting Seeker_E now rather than holding out and potentially remaining unmatched."

With quota=1 and no other inbound applicants this round, accepting Seeker_D secures a very high-priority match immediately. Waiting would only be justified if Seeker_B were likely to apply soon and accept us, but Seeker_B ranks Company_A last, making that unlikely.
