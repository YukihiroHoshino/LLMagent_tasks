However, Seeker_C has already applied and explicitly states we are their top choice, making acceptance highly likely to secure a strong match immediately. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_D only 3rd and may apply to Company_E or Company_B first; we have no other inbound applications this round. With quota 1, locking in Seeker_C now yields a high-priority, stable match rather than gambling for Seeker_A."

We still have quota 1 and no other applicants this round, but higher-priority targets (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) may approach us in later rounds.

Since Seeker_B is higher on our priority list than Seeker_A and is available now, we should preserve the slot for Seeker_B (or potentially Seeker_E later, though Seeker_E currently ranks us last and is unlikely to apply).
