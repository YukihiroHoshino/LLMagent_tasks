In this round, applicants include Seeker_B (#2) and Seeker_D (#4) in addition to Seeker_A (#3). Since Seeker_B is higher on our true priority list and is also applying to us as their #1 choice, accepting Seeker_A now would forgo the opportunity to match with a higher-priority candidate this round.

Seeker_B is the highest-ranked among those who applied this round. While Seeker_E is ranked above Seeker_B, Seeker_E has Company_E as their last choice and is unlikely to apply/accept, so holding the slot for Seeker_E is risky and could leave us unmatched. Seeker_B also ranks Company_E as #1, so accepting now secures a strong, stable match aligned with our priorities and within quota (1).

Company_E is my last choice but it ranks me 1st, so I can likely secure it later if needed. To maximize my chance at a higher-ranked match, I will start by applying to Company_C and make a strong, specific pitch; if rejected, I can pivot to Company_A/D/B in later rounds while keeping Company_E as a fallback."

Seeker_B ranks Company_C as their 2nd choice (after Company_E), Seeker_A ranks us last, Seeker_D ranks us last, and Seeker_C ranks us 2nd. Company_E highly prioritizes Seeker_B and is Seeker_B’s top choice, so Seeker_B is likely to match with Company_E if available. Seeker_C may apply to Company_D first, where they are ranked 2nd, making them a plausible alternative later. Given only Seeker_E has applied to us this round and they rank us #1, accepting now guarantees a match but may forgo a chance at higher-ranked candidates later. However, higher-ranked candidates are unlikely to choose us early (A/D last; B likely taken by E). Best move is to accept Seeker_E to fill the role with a known, committed candidate rather than risk ending unmatched."

Seeker_C ranks us #1, so acceptance likely locks a stable match. If we reject to wait for Seeker_A, we risk losing Seeker_C and may not receive Seeker_A later because Seeker_A prefers Company_E and Company_B over us, making it uncertain they will apply.

Waiting risks losing Seeker_D to another company (Seeker_D ranks Company_E first and may apply there next), leaving me potentially with lower-priority options later.
