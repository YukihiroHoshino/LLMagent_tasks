However, Seeker_B ranks Company_C as their 2nd choice, so there is a reasonable chance they come to Company_C after Company_E.

I’m ready to start immediately and can jump into ownership of 1–2 priority workstreams in week 1.\n\nThank you for reconsidering. [APPLY]",

Company_C explicitly asked me to send a Google Doc link with the artifact plus one concrete metric, then re-submit with [APPLY] to be eligible for an immediate decision. I will comply, provide a shareable link placeholder, add a clear estimated metric, and formally apply to prompt a timely accept/reject once their higher-priority conversations resolve."

This is exactly the kind of concrete execution + stakeholder-management signal we needed.\n\nWe’d like to move forward with you for the role at Company_C. We’ll follow up with next steps to confirm start timing and complete the remaining process items. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_E is in the inbox this round. While Seeker_E is 4th on our true priority list (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D), none of those higher-priority seekers are currently engaging us, and we risk ending unmatched if we continue to wait. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong responsiveness, provided the requested artifact and a concrete metric, and has Company_C as their top choice, increasing match stability. Given the round is already 6 and there is no competing applicant pressure in our inbox, accepting Seeker_E now secures a satisfactory (in-list) candidate rather than holding out for uncertain higher-priority options."
