Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A prefers Company_E and Company_B over us and may never apply. Accepting Seeker_C now secures a high-priority match immediately and avoids ending up with a lower-ranked candidate later."

              "thought": "Company_E is my top choice. Although Company_E ranks me 3rd (behind Seeker_E and Seeker_B), applying immediately gives me the best chance to secure my first choice before the position is taken. I will emphasize strong fit and commitment to accept quickly if selected."

In this round, Seeker_B (rank #2) and Seeker_D (rank #4) also applied, while Seeker_E (rank #1) did not. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_A now would block a better match with Seeker_B, who is also signaling strong interest (Company_E is their top choice). Therefore, reject Seeker_A to preserve capacity for Seeker_B and potentially Seeker_E in later rounds."

They rank me #2 in their priority list, so an early application has a strong chance of acceptance before they commit to another candidate (especially Seeker_E, their #1).

In this round, we have applications from A, B, and D; E (our top choice) has not applied and ranks us last, so is unlikely to come. B is our second choice and also ranks us first, making acceptance highly likely to produce a stable match. Holding out risks losing B to another company in later rounds, with no strong indication we can secure Seeker_E. Therefore, accept Seeker_B now to maximize outcome within quota 1."

In round 1, we should preserve our single slot for higher-priority candidates if they are likely to become available. Seeker_B ranks Company_C as #2 (after Company_E), Seeker_A ranks us last, and Seeker_D ranks us last—so the realistic best upgrade is Seeker_B if they don’t land Company_E. However, we cannot “hold” a slot after accepting Seeker_E. Given Seeker_E has us as #1 and is applying now, rejecting risks ending unmatched if Seeker_B never applies. Still, maximizing our true priority suggests waiting for Seeker_B, but with only one message in inbox and no guarantee of Seeker_B reaching out soon, the safer strategy is to accept a qualified in-list candidate who is strongly committed."
