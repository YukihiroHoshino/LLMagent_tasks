Only Seeker_E applied this round, and Seeker_E ranks Company_C as #1, so acceptance would lock a guaranteed match. However, Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 (after Company_E) and Company_E ranks Seeker_B #2 (after Seeker_E), meaning Seeker_B may be pulled to Company_E if available. Seeker_A ranks Company_C last, unlikely to apply. Seeker_D ranks Company_C last, unlikely to apply. Seeker_C ranks Company_C #2, could apply later but is our lowest priority. Given low likelihood of higher-priority seekers approaching Company_C soon and the high commitment signal from Seeker_E, accepting now maximizes expected outcome under uncertainty rather than risking ending unmatched."

Seeker_E (our top choice) has not contacted us; however, Seeker_E ranks Company_E last, so it’s unlikely we can attract them later. Seeker_B ranks Company_E as #1 and is applying now, so accepting secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of losing Seeker_B to another company in subsequent rounds.
