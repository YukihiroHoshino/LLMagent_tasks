If there’s any scenario where you would reopen consideration for me this round, I’d value a clear yes/no and what the deciding criteria would be.\n\nIf helpful, I can commit immediately and align to a very specific need (own a defined project end-to-end, cover execution bandwidth, or take a scoped trial period) to reduce risk. I’m trying to be respectful of your process while also understanding whether there’s a realistic path forward.\n\nThanks again for your time.",

In that scenario we would reassess the remaining pool at that time.
