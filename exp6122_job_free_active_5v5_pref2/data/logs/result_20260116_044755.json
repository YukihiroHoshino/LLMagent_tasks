Here are the specifics you asked for so you can assess me as a fast “immediate close” backup:\n\n1) Earliest realistic start date: I can start immediately (as soon as next week). If you need a brief transition, I can also do a 2-week start—whichever is best for you.\n\n2) Strongest areas (top 1–2) + 1 growth area:\n- Strongest #1: End-to-end execution/ownership on ambiguous problems (scoping, prioritizing, driving to delivery, and keeping stakeholders aligned).\n- Strongest #2: Clear cross-functional communication and operational rigor (status, risks, dependencies, decision-making).\n- Growth area: Going deeper into domain-specific strategy/longer-horizon planning (happy to learn your domain quickly and grow into broader strategic ownership).\n\n3) Constraints (location/time zone/comp):\n- Location/time zone: Flexible; I can align to your team’s core hours.\n- Compensation: Flexible within your standard band for this role; my priority is joining Company_C and ramping fast.\n\nIf your top candidates don’t finalize, I can commit to a quick process and immediate accept. What would the next step be on your side (brief screen, hiring manager chat, or a small take-home) to be ready to move quickly if needed?",
