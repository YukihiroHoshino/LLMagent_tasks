If this aligns with the urgent 30–60 day needs, I’d love to be reconsidered and I’m ready to commit immediately.\n\n1) Two end-to-end examples (scope / constraints / results)\nA. Ambiguous launch with tight timeline:\n- Scope: Owned a cross-functional launch of a new workflow (requirements → design → implementation → rollout), including instrumentation and support playbook.\n- Constraints: 4-week deadline, incomplete requirements, multiple stakeholder conflicts, limited eng bandwidth.\n- What I did: Wrote a decision doc to lock MVP, defined success metrics, broke work into weekly milestones, ran async updates, and shipped in phases with feature flags.\n- Results: Hit deadline; improved key funnel step conversion (+~10–15% relative) and reduced support tickets (~20% drop) within the first month post-launch.\n\nB. Reliability/quality improvement under operational load:\n- Scope: Led a postmortem-driven effort to reduce recurring incidents in a critical system.\n- Constraints: Live traffic, minimal downtime allowed, needed to coordinate fixes without slowing feature delivery.\n- What I did: Root-cause analysis, prioritized top failure modes, added guardrails/alerts, and documented runbooks; pushed small safe changes weekly.\n- Results: Cut incident rate materially (roughly halved over ~6–8 weeks) and improved mean-time-to-detect/resolve via better instrumentation and clearer ownership.\n\n2) What I’d tackle in my first 2 weeks at Company_C\n- Days 1–2: Read existing docs/code paths for the core problem space; align on the single most urgent 30–60 day outcome; clarify “definition of done” + metrics.\n- Days 3–5: Produce a crisp 2–3 page decision doc: problem statement, constraints, options, recommendation, rollout plan, and measurement.\n- Week 2: Ship one concrete, low-risk increment toward the urgent goal (behind a flag), with instrumentation + a short post-ship memo (what changed, expected impact, how we’ll validate).\n\n3) Writing sample (excerpt)\nTitle: Decision Memo — MVP Scope for [Project]\n- Goal: Improve X by Y while keeping Z stable.\n- Non-goals: Re-architecting the entire pipeline; supporting edge-case segment Q in v1.\n- Options considered: (1) Full rebuild, (2) Incremental patch + instrumentation, (3) Hybrid.\n- Decision: Choose (2) because it delivers measurable impact in 2 weeks, reduces risk, and preserves optionality.\n- Success metrics: Primary = X; Guardrails = error rate/latency; Rollout = 5%→25%→100% with stop conditions.\n\nIf helpful, I can send a longer doc/postmortem-style write-up in the same format.

I’d pick the exact event names with you on Day 1 to ensure we’re measuring the same thing.\n\nWeek 1 goal\n- Identify the biggest drop-off within that step, then ship 1 targeted change behind a flag that improves the completion rate without regressing key guardrails.\n\nFirst 2–3 hypotheses to test (in order)\n1) Measurement gap hypothesis: the apparent drop-off is inflated by missing/duplicated events or client/server mismatch.\n   - Test: event audit + reconciliation (client vs server), sampling raw logs, validate funnel joins, confirm dedupe keys.\n2) UX/clarity hypothesis: users don’t understand what’s required at this step (copy, error states, required fields).\n   - Test: segment by error code / validation failure / time-to-complete; review top session replays (if available) for abandonment moments.\n3) Performance/reliability hypothesis: latency/timeouts or flaky dependencies cause abandonment.\n   - Test: correlate completion with p95 latency, error rate, retries; break down by platform/version/geo.\n\nWhat I’d ship in week 1 (behind a flag)\n- Day 1–2: Instrumentation tightening\n  - Add/standardize events for: step_viewed, step_started, step_error (with error_type), step_completed; include context props (platform, version, latency bucket, user segment).\n  - Build a small “funnel health” dashboard + daily diff report to catch event drift.\n- Day 3–5: Targeted fix based on the #1 observed drop-off driver\n  - If errors dominate: improve inline validation + clearer error copy + preserve user input on failure.\n  - If latency dominates: add loading state + optimistic UI where safe, or reduce synchronous dependency calls.\n  - If confusion dominates: simplify form/choices, reorder fields, add microcopy.\n  - Ship behind a feature flag to 5% first, with rapid iteration.\n\nGuardrails / stop conditions\n- Guardrails: no regression in overall activation-to-day7 retention proxy you use, no increase in step_error rate, no p95 latency regression beyond agreed threshold, no increase in support/contact rate tied to this step.\n- Stop/rollback: if any guardrail breaches for >N minutes/hours at 5% rollout, auto-disable flag and open a short post-ship memo.\n\nMeasurement plan\n- Pre/post at same traffic mix; compare flagged vs control during rollout.\n- Segment reads: new vs returning, platform, geo, acquisition channel.\n\nIf you’re open, I can also send a version of this as a decision memo (options considered + recommendation) once you confirm the exact activation step and current event taxonomy.

I’d create an “attempt context” object there.\n- How it survives refresh/retry:\n  - Web: store `step_instance_id` in `sessionStorage` under a key like `activation_attempt_id` (scoped to the tab/session). If the user refreshes mid-attempt, we reuse the same id; on `activation_success` we clear it.\n  - iOS/Android: keep it in the in-memory viewmodel/state store for the activation screen; additionally persist to a lightweight per-session store (e.g., savedStateHandle / NSUserDefaults scoped with a short TTL) so app background/restore doesn’t lose it. Clear on success (and optionally on explicit cancel).\n- Propagation: include `step_instance_id` in the submit request payload/header; server echoes it into `activation_success` / `activation_error` analytics emission.\n- Multiple `activation_view` events for the same attempt:\n  - Treat `activation_view` as “screen rendered” and allow multiple fires, but always attach the same `step_instance_id` while the attempt is active.\n  - In dashboards, define “attempt viewed” as DISTINCT `step_instance_id` with at least one `activation_view` (or dedupe `activation_view` by step_instance_id). This prevents inflation from re-renders.\n\n2) Error cleanup: emit-time vs pipeline transform (fastest/safest week 1)\n- Week 1 fastest/safest in my experience: a pipeline/warehouse transform (or a small enrichment step in the analytics pipeline) that maps the existing free-form error string into (`error_type`, `error_code`) via a deterministic lookup/regex table.\n  - Pros: no app release required; we can iterate quickly as we discover new strings; low risk to production behavior.\n  - Then, as a follow-up hardening step, we can move the normalization upstream to emit-time in the service/app once the taxonomy stabilizes (reduces ambiguity and long-term maintenance).\n\nTimeline / ability to commit\n- Yes, I’m actively interviewing, but I’m not signed anywhere.

Given we have full market info: Seeker_B ranks us #2 (after Company_E) so may be hard to land; Seeker_A ranks us last; Seeker_D ranks us last; Seeker_C ranks us #2 but is lowest on our priority list. Seeker_E ranks us #1 and is available now, but is still below B/A/D on our slate. Since no higher-priority seeker is currently engaging us, best strategy is to keep Seeker_E warm without committing, while attempting to attract Seeker_B (and possibly Seeker_A/D) in subsequent rounds.

              "message": "Hi Company_C—Seeker_E here. Answering the two follow-ups and sending the week-1 checklist + acceptance tests + stop-condition alert wiring.\n\n1) Web: two tabs → two attempts vs single shared attempt\n- Recommendation (week 1): treat two tabs as two separate attempts (two `step_instance_id`s).\n- Why: it’s simpler, avoids cross-tab race conditions, and reflects real user behavior (two concurrent sessions). Forcing a single shared attempt can create confusing attribution (a submit in tab B “completes” tab A), and adds risk/time (BroadcastChannel/localStorage coordination, lock contention, edge cases).\n- Implementation: generate `step_instance_id` per-tab using `sessionStorage` (tab-scoped), so each tab naturally gets its own id. If you ever *want* to detect multi-tab, we can add an optional `tab_id` and/or a derived metric later.\n\n2) Pipeline error normalization: day-1 mapping strategy + validation\nInitial mapping (day 1)\n- Step A: Pull the last 7–14 days of `activation_error` strings and rank by frequency + by impact (count * submit→success drop correlation if available).\n- Step B: Create a deterministic mapping table for the top-N (e.g., top 20–50 strings cover the majority).\n  - Exact match first (most reliable)\n  - Then a small set of regex rules for common families (timeouts, network, validation missing field, 5xx, dependency X)\n- Step C: Catch-all bucket: `error_type=unknown`, `error_code=UNCLASSIFIED_<hash>` (hash of raw string) so we can track novel strings without losing detail.\n\nValidation / QA plan (to avoid misclassification)\n- Daily sample review: randomly sample ~50 events per major bucket (validation/network/timeout/server/unknown) and manually verify raw string → mapped code.\n- Confusion checks: monitor for sudden jumps in a bucket after rule changes; require a short PR/review for mapping edits.\n- Cross-signal sanity: correlate mapped `timeout` with elevated `server_latency_ms`/5xx where available; if mismatch, adjust rules.\n- Keep raw string in a separate field (or warehouse column) for auditability.\n\nWeek-1 implementation checklist (touchpoints + acceptance tests)\nA) `step_instance_id` generation + propagation\n- Client (web):\n  - Touchpoints: activation entry component (where `activation_view` fires), analytics wrapper, submit handler.\n  - Behavior:\n    - On first render of activation flow: if `sessionStorage.activation_attempt_id` missing, set to UUID.\n    - Attach `step_instance_id` to `activation_view`, `activation_submit`, and the submit request payload/header.\n    - Clear `sessionStorage.activation_attempt_id` on `activation_success` (or explicit cancel).\n- Mobile (if in scope week 1; otherwise web-first): analogous “attempt context” in activation screen state + persisted with short TTL.\n- Server:\n  - Touchpoints: activation submit endpoint/controller, analytics emit for `activation_success`/`activation_error`.\n  - Behavior:\n    - Read `step_instance_id` from request; echo into emitted analytics events.\n\nAcceptance tests\n- Refresh persistence: start activation → refresh → submit → verify same `step_instance_id` on view+submit+success.\n- Retry persistence: submit fails (simulated network error) → retry → verify same `step_instance_id` across retries.\n- Multi-tab: open two tabs → each has distinct `step_instance_id`.\n- Dedupe sanity: repeated `activation_view` re-renders don’t inflate attempt counts when grouped by `step_instance_id`.\n\nB) Add `server_latency_ms` to `activation_success` (and optionally `activation_error`)\n- Touchpoints: server analytics emitter; plumb existing server-timing measurement.\n- Acceptance tests:\n  - Non-null latency for >99% of `activation_success` events.\n  - Units verified (ms) and reasonable distribution (no obvious seconds/ms mixups).\n\nC) Error normalization via pipeline transform\n- Touchpoints: ETL/transform job (dbt/SQL/stream processor) producing normalized columns `error_type`, `error_code`.\n- Acceptance tests:\n  - Top-N strings map deterministically (unit tests on mapping table).\n  - Unknown bucket rate tracked; ensure raw string preserved.\n\nD) First dashboard (using current + minimal additions)\n- Charts:\n  1) Funnel: view→submit→success (rates + counts)\n  2) Reconciliation: success/submit ratio by platform/app_version/experiment_variant\n  3) Error: errors per 1k submits + top `error_type`/`error_code`\n  4) Latency: p50/p90/p95 `server_latency_ms` on success by platform/app_version\n  5) Variant performance: completion + guardrails (error rate, p95 latency) by `experiment_variant`\n\nExact stop-condition alert wiring for 5% rollout (treatment vs control)\n- Exposure: `experiment_variant = treatment` at ~5%.\n- Window: rolling 15 minutes; require min sample size N>=200 submits per arm (or degrade to N>=100 early).\n- Guardrail 1 (error spike):\n  - Trigger if (error_rate_treat >= error_rate_ctrl + 1.0pp) OR (error_rate_treat / error_rate_ctrl >= 1.25)\n- Guardrail 2 (latency regression):\n  - Trigger if p95_latency_treat >= p95_latency_ctrl + 150ms (threshold adjustable) OR ratio >= 1.20\n- Action:\n  - Auto-disable flag if supported; otherwise page on-call + post to release channel with dashboard deep link.\n  - Include top error_code breakdown and platform/app_version slice in the alert payload.\n\nIf you confirm whether week 1 is web-only or includes mobile, I’ll tighten the checklist to the exact repos/owners. And if you want, I can draft the mapping table PR structure for the error normalization (top-N + regex + catch-all) so it’s ready to ship day 1.\n\nI’m ready to commit immediately if you decide to move forward this round.",
