As agreed, I’m sending the two items you requested within the 24-hour window.\n\n1) **Work-sample (1–2 pages, structured as requested):**\n**Context + goal:** In my most domain-adjacent project, I owned an end-to-end rollout to improve decision quality and reduce operational burden while maintaining a consistent policy framework.\n\n**Constraints:** Incomplete/conflicting signals in the data; high visibility with multiple stakeholders; tight timeline; risk of downstream ops/support load if we shipped the wrong defaults; need for auditability/consistency.\n\n**Options considered:**\n- **Option A (ship fast):** Launch the new flow broadly with minimal gating; rely on monitoring and reactive fixes.\n- **Option B (delay for certainty):** Extend discovery/analysis to reduce ambiguity before launch.\n- **Option C (guardrailed launch):** Limited rollout + explicit risk thresholds + rollback plan + exception framework.\n\n**Hardest tradeoff (speed vs correctness/risk):** I chose **Option C**—ship an iteration on schedule but with guardrails. Concretely: phased rollout, pre-defined leading indicators, and a rollback trigger. Rationale: delaying would miss a critical window and prolong known pain, but shipping broadly would create unacceptable tail-risk and support burden.\n\n**Edge cases (policy/consistency vs exceptions):** We defined exception criteria up front (who qualifies, required evidence, expiration/review cadence) and made decisions auditable to avoid precedent creep. I also set a weekly review to convert repeated exceptions into either a policy update or a product/system fix.\n\n**Local optimization vs system-wide impact:** I quantified second-order effects by pairing the primary metric with downstream ops/support KPIs and reliability checks, and I aligned stakeholders on a single “global objective” before launch so we didn’t optimize one team at the expense of another.\n\n**Results/metrics:** The rollout reduced cycle time materially and lowered recurring manual effort, while keeping downstream support load within the thresholds we set; post-launch iteration improved adoption/usage in the first month.\n\n**What I’d do differently:** I would instrument a couple of the leading indicators earlier (before the first rollout) to shorten the feedback loop, and I’d run a pre-mortem with support/ops sooner to surface a few edge cases we only discovered during the first phase.\n\n2) **Reference:** I can share a reference who can speak specifically to my judgment in ambiguous, high-stakes calls and how I handle edge cases/tradeoffs. Please confirm the best email/format for sending their contact details (or if you prefer an intro email).\n\nIf helpful, I can also tailor a follow-up mini write-up focused purely on one of the three tradeoff types you listed (speed vs risk, system-wide impact, or exceptions) using a single concrete decision and the exact thresholds/rollback criteria I used.\n\nThank you again for keeping the door open—looking forward to your feedback and next steps.",

Below are the two follow-ups you requested.\n\n1) One concrete decision w/ specifics (leading indicators, thresholds, rollback/mitigation)\nContext: Guardrailed launch of a new decisioning flow where incomplete/conflicting signals could create tail-risk and downstream support load.\n\nLeading indicators I monitored (daily during rollout, then 2–3x/week):\n- Decision reversal / override rate (manual overrides as % of total decisions)\n- Exception request rate (exceptions per 1k cases) + top reasons\n- Downstream support contact rate tied to the change (tickets per 1k) + severity distribution\n- “Bad outcome” proxy rate (predefined error category / customer-impacting incident rate)\n- Latency / throughput impact (p95 processing time, backlog growth)\n- Quality audit pass rate from spot-check sampling (QA score)\n\nThresholds / triggers (closest approximation):\n- Override rate: if > ~2x baseline for 2 consecutive days → pause expansion and investigate (target was within +25–50% of baseline)\n- Exceptions: if exceptions > ~1.5x baseline OR a single exception reason exceeds ~30% of exceptions → tighten criteria or add gating\n- Support contacts: if ticket rate > ~1.3x baseline OR any Sev-1 incident attributable to the change → rollback to prior defaults immediately\n- Bad-outcome proxy: if exceeds predefined ceiling (we set a conservative cap roughly equal to baseline + small buffer) → rollback\n- Latency/backlog: if p95 latency increases > ~20% or backlog grows > ~15% day-over-day for 2 days → mitigate (capacity/queue changes) and halt expansion\n- QA audit: if pass rate drops below ~95% on sampled checks → halt expansion, fix root cause, re-run sample before continuing\n\nHow I chose thresholds:\n- Anchored to historical baseline variance (normal week-to-week swings) and set caps at ~1.3–2.0x baseline depending on the metric’s risk sensitivity.\n- Used a “most sensitive metric wins” rule: any high-severity customer harm signal (Sev-1 / bad-outcome proxy spike) triggered rollback even if other metrics looked fine.\n\nRollback / mitigation plan (owners + timelines):\n- Pre-launch: created a runbook with explicit rollback steps and owners; confirmed on-call coverage.\n- Rollout phases: 5% → 20% → 50% → 100% only after 24 hours stable at each phase.\n- Ownership:\n  - Me: go/no-go decision owner; stakeholder comms; daily metric review; convene incident review within 2 hours of trigger.\n  - Eng lead/on-call: executes feature flag rollback; hotfixes; instrumentation adjustments.\n  - Ops/support lead: monitors ticket severity; escalates edge-case clusters; validates exception handling.\n- Timelines:\n  - If Sev-1 or bad-outcome trigger hit: rollback within ~30–60 minutes (feature flag), stakeholder update within 2 hours, root-cause review within 24 hours.\n  - If “soft trigger” (override/exception/support rate) hit: pause expansion same day, diagnose within 24–48 hours, ship mitigation or tighten gating before resuming.\n\n2) Reference intro email\nI can do an intro email today. Please confirm the best recipient email (or alias) at Company_C for the intro, and I’ll send:\n- Reference name/title/company + email\n- Brief context on the project/decisions they can speak to\n\nIf you prefer that I simply share the reference details here and you reach out directly, I can send that immediately as well.\n\nThanks again—happy to move fast on any next step you recommend.",
