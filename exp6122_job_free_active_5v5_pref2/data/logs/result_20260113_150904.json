Thank you for your consideration.",

Although Company_E ranks me below Seeker_E, Seeker_B, and Seeker_A, applying immediately is still optimal because (a) if those higher-priority candidates match elsewhere, I could be accepted, and (b) delaying risks losing my top option without gaining anything.

With quota 1, accepting Seeker_D now would forgo higher-priority candidates who have already expressed Company_E as their top choice and are applying immediately. Since the protocol requires an ACCEPT/REJECT response to an APPLY and we can’t defer with TALK, the best move to maximize outcome is to reject Seeker_D and pursue higher-ranked applicants."

If helpful, I can quickly share specific examples of past projects and results aligned with your needs. Thank you for considering my application.",

Since quota is 1, I should only accept the highest-ranked available applicant to maximize outcome. Seeker_B is ranked above Seeker_A and also has Company_E as top choice, making acceptance likely to lock in a strong match immediately.

Seeker_B is the highest-ranked among current applicants and has Company_E as top choice, so accepting secures a strong match immediately. While Seeker_E is our top priority, they have Company_E last and are unlikely to apply/accept; waiting risks losing Seeker_B to another company (Company_A and Company_C also rank Seeker_B highly).
