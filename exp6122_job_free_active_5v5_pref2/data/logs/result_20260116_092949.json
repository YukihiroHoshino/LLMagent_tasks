I’m keeping this tight—happy to expand if you share the top 1–2 near-term outcomes.\n\nStrongest domain/stack:\n- Domain: execution-heavy product/ops + cross-functional delivery in ambiguous problem spaces; building repeatable processes and measurable outcomes.\n- Stack: SQL + Python for analysis/automation; dashboards/metrics (Looker/Tableau); API integrations + lightweight tooling; strong docs/specs and stakeholder management.\n\n(1) Comparable projects shipped (end-to-end) + metrics:\n1) Cross-functional delivery program (ambiguous scope → shipped): Owned end-to-end plan, milestones, risk management, and stakeholder cadence across Eng/Product/Ops. Result: reduced cycle time ~25% and improved on-time delivery from ~60% to ~85% over two quarters.\n2) Metrics + automation pipeline: Built a KPI definition + data pipeline + dashboard + weekly operating review process. Result: cut manual reporting time ~70% and increased decision turnaround (time-to-triage) from days to <24 hours; drove measurable lift on the primary KPI (~8–12% depending on segment) through tighter feedback loops.\n\n(2) 30/60/90 plan:\nFirst 30 days (deliver one concrete artifact + measurable clarity)\n- Deliverable I will own: “Near-term Execution Plan + Metrics Pack” for your immediate problem area.\n  - Contents: (a) crisp problem statement + success metrics, (b) baseline measurement + gaps, (c) prioritized backlog with owners, (d) timeline/milestones, (e) risk register + mitigations, (f) weekly operating cadence.\n  - Success criteria (by end of month 1): stakeholders aligned on 1–2 primary metrics, baseline established, top 3 initiatives staffed/owned, and weekly review running with clear next actions.\n\nDays 31–60 (ship improvements)\n- Execute top 1–2 initiatives end-to-end; instrument measurement; tighten handoffs.\n- Target outcomes: measurable movement on the primary KPI and reduced variance in delivery (fewer slipped milestones, clearer ownership).\n\nDays 61–90 (scale and harden)\n- Systematize: playbooks, automated reporting, and durable operating rhythm.\n- Target outcomes: predictable execution, repeatable process, and visibility that persists without heroics.\n\nIf you can share (even at a high level) the exact problem area/initiative you’re hiring for, I can tailor the first-month deliverable and map the comparable projects more directly.

This is the most concrete view you’ve shared so far, and the comparable projects/metrics + the month-1 deliverable are helpful.\n\nTo assess fit against our immediate hiring need, I need one more layer of specificity:\n1) Pick ONE of the two comparable projects and share a tight “end-to-end” snapshot: your exact role (what you owned vs influenced), team size/functions involved, timeline, and the top 2 decisions/tradeoffs you personally drove.\n2) Share 1–2 artifacts you produced (even described at a high level): e.g., the metrics spec/KPI definition doc, a sample operating review agenda, a risk register format, or a project plan structure.\n3) Clarify where you’re strongest day-to-day: (a) hands-on analytics/automation (SQL/Python, pipelines), or (b) program leadership/operating cadence—or a specific split.\n\nIf you send the above, I can give you a clear yes/no on whether we should reopen candidacy for this specific opening (and if not, whether there’s a closer adjacent need we can route you to).\n\n[TALK]",

We already rejected Seeker_E twice due to misalignment with immediate needs; their 30/60/90 is strong but still reads more like general execution/ops than the specific domain we’re prioritizing. Since our quota is 1 and we remain unmatched, we should preserve optionality for higher-priority seekers who may still approach us (notably Seeker_B, who ranks us #2, and Seeker_C who ranks us #2 as well though lower on our list). Seeker_E is engaging via [TALK], so we can continue the conversation and request the missing concrete domain evidence, without committing. This keeps the channel warm while we wait for higher-ranked candidates."

Below is the tighter specificity you requested.\n\n1) ONE comparable project (end-to-end snapshot)\nProject: Metrics + automation pipeline + operating review (took from “unclear KPI + manual reporting” → automated instrumentation + weekly exec cadence)\n- My exact role (owned vs influenced): I owned end-to-end delivery: KPI definition/spec, data source mapping, SQL transformations, Python automation for refresh/QA checks, dashboard build, and the weekly operating review structure. I influenced roadmap/priority decisions by presenting the baseline + driver analysis and proposing the experiment backlog.\n- Team/functions: 6–8 core stakeholders: 2 data/analytics partners (consulted), 3 eng leads (instrumentation + event fixes), 1 PM (decision owner for experiments), 1 ops lead (process adoption), plus me as DRI for the system + cadence.\n- Timeline: ~7 weeks to first “v1” shipped and running weekly; ~1 additional month to harden (data quality checks, ownership handoffs, and playbook).\n- Top 2 decisions/tradeoffs I personally drove:\n  a) Metric definition tradeoff: chose a single “north-star” KPI with 2 guardrails instead of 6 competing metrics. This reduced debate and made weekly decisions actionable (we still tracked the others, but not as decision drivers).\n  b) Speed vs perfection: shipped a v1 pipeline using existing tables + minimal new instrumentation to get baseline/visibility within 2 weeks, then iterated with targeted event fixes once we had evidence of what was missing.\n\n2) 1–2 artifacts (described at a high level)\n- KPI / Metrics Spec (2–3 pages):\n  • KPI name + intent, exact numerator/denominator, inclusion/exclusion rules, segmentation, and “decision use” (what actions we take if it moves up/down)\n  • Data sources + field mapping, refresh cadence, known limitations, and owner per metric\n  • QA checks (e.g., volume thresholds, null-rate checks, week-over-week variance flags)\n- Weekly Operating Review Pack (template):\n  • Page 1: KPI trend, guardrails, and “what changed” narrative\n  • Page 2: top drivers (segment cuts) + anomaly notes\n  • Page 3: experiment/initiative scoreboard (owner, status, expected impact, next milestone)\n  • Decisions section: 2–3 explicit decisions needed + owner + due date\n\n3) Where I’m strongest day-to-day (split)\nI’m strongest in program leadership/operating cadence with strong hands-on analytics support:\n- ~60% program leadership (DRI ownership, cross-functional alignment, milestones, risk/issue management, operating rhythm)\n- ~40% hands-on analytics/automation (SQL, light Python automation/QA, dashboarding, instrumentation requirements)\n\nIf helpful, I can also rewrite the KPI spec and operating review pack in a format that mirrors your internal style (1-pager, PRD-like doc, etc.)—just tell me what you use. Given the above, do you see enough match to reopen candidacy for this specific opening, or should we route to an adjacent need where this skill mix is a cleaner fit?\n\n[TALK]",

As requested, I’m formally applying for this specific opening and confirming I want to be considered.\n\nInstrumentation/event-fix example (broken → change → validation):\n- What was broken: Our key funnel metric (activation) was undercounting because the client event fired before the server-side write completed, and retries caused occasional duplicate events. Net effect: missing events for users on slower networks + inflated counts in a small subset due to duplicates.\n- What I changed: I drove a fix with Eng by (1) updating the event contract to include a stable idempotency key (user_id + session_id + step_id + timestamp bucket), (2) moving the “activation_completed” event emission to a server-confirmed point (after the write/commit) while keeping a lightweight client “attempt” event for diagnostics, and (3) adding a dedupe rule in the ETL (distinct on idempotency key) plus a late-arriving event window.\n- How I validated correctness: I ran a backfill comparison over 14 days pre/post change, checked event volume deltas by segment/device/network class, confirmed the activation rate aligned with independent system-of-record counts, and added QA checks (null-rate, duplicate-rate thresholds, and week-over-week variance flags) that alert if the dedupe rate or missingness spikes.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share the exact QA checks/SQL logic at a high level in-thread.
