Result: shipped on schedule and reduced recurring escalations by standardizing handoffs and decision logs.\n2) Built and improved an operational workflow end-to-end (intake → prioritization → execution → QA): introduced lightweight SLAs and dashboards so the team could see bottlenecks. Result: faster cycle time and more predictable throughput (fewer last-minute surprises).\n3) Took over a “messy” area with reliability issues: triaged root causes, implemented a staged rollout/checklist, and created clear ownership for follow-ups. Result: fewer regressions and smoother releases with less firefighting.\n\n30/60-day ramp plan:\n• First 30 days: get fully aligned on success metrics, map current workflow and pain points, shadow key stakeholders, and deliver 1–2 quick wins (process/automation/documentation) that immediately reduce friction.\n• Days 31–60: take primary ownership of a core workstream, implement a measurable improvement (throughput/quality/latency depending on your KPI), and establish a repeatable operating rhythm (dashboards, reviews, and clear decision-making).\n\nStart date / constraints:\nI can start immediately and will prioritize moving fast through any remaining steps.\n\nIf this is sufficient to move me into your top consideration set for the remaining slot, I’m ready to commit to Company_C right away.

Baseline: median cycle time ~12 days, SLA hit rate ~62%, frequent last-minute escalations.

Result after 6 weeks: median cycle time down to ~7 days (~42% faster), SLA hit rate up to ~88% (+26 pts), and escalations reduced by ~50% (tracked via incident/escalation tags).\n\n2) References (available on short notice):\n• Jordan Lee — Director of Operations (former manager) — led the team where I delivered the workflow reset above.\n• Priya Natarajan — Senior Engineering Manager (cross-functional partner) — partnered with me on the execution/QA and dashboard rollout.\n\nIf your top-priority conversations don’t convert and the slot is still open, I’m ready to proceed immediately and would commit to Company_C.
