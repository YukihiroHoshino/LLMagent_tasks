I:\n- Defined success metrics and instrumented the funnel end-to-end.\n- Led cross-functional execution (weekly operating cadence, dependency management, and scope control).\n- Shipped an MVP within one cycle, then iterated based on measured drop-offs.\nOutcome: improved the key funnel conversion by ~18% relative and reduced time-to-complete by ~25%, with no increase in support tickets (guardrail).

Below are the two requested add-ons (kept concrete + anonymized).\n\n1) Past project (exact problem, funnel steps, dependencies, before/after metric tree)\nProject / problem statement:\n- Problem: “Users who start the multi-step onboarding/workflow are failing to reach ‘first successful completion’ within 7 days, driving higher early churn and more support contacts.”\n- Goal: increase 7-day completion (activation) while holding quality/support constant.\n\nFunnel steps instrumented (key events):\n1. Eligible user lands on onboarding start\n2. Starts step 1 (profile/config)\n3. Completes step 1\n4. Starts step 2 (connect/integrate)\n5. Completes step 2\n6. Starts step 3 (first task/action)\n7. Completes step 3\n8. Reaches “first successful outcome” (activation event)\n9. Returns within 7 days (early retention check)\n\nTop cross-functional dependencies I had to unblock:\n- Engineering/platform: missing/incorrect event instrumentation + identity stitching (users switching devices); needed a clean event taxonomy + QA plan before we could trust the funnel.\n- Ops/Support: step-2 failures were partly driven by policy/verification and unclear error handling; coordinated changes to workflows + updated macros/help content.\n- Legal/Compliance (and Security review): we needed approval for copy/UX changes around permissions and data connections; I drove a time-boxed review with explicit risk mitigations.\n\nSimple before/after metric tree (anonymized):\n- North Star: 7-day Activation = % of new users reaching “first successful outcome” within 7 days\n  - Driver A: Step-2 completion rate (connect/integrate)\n    - Sub-driver: error rate at auth/permission step\n    - Sub-driver: time-to-complete step 2\n  - Driver B: Step-3 completion rate (first task/action)\n    - Sub-driver: clarity of next-best-action guidance\n  - Guardrails:\n    - Support contact rate per new user (7d)\n    - Error rate / incident rate\n    - Time-to-first-success p50/p90\n\nResults (directionally):\n- Activation: +~18% relative\n- Time-to-complete: -~25%\n- Guardrail: support contacts flat to slightly down (no increase)\n\n2) Concrete scenario (choose one): Reducing drop-off at a critical step in a multi-stage workflow\nScenario: Drop-off spikes at Step 2 (“connect/integrate”) in a 5-step workflow.\n\nApproach (8–10 bullets):\n1. Define primary metric: Step-2 completion rate (and overall workflow completion) for new users within 7 days.\n2. Guardrails: auth/error rate, support contacts per user, latency, and downstream success rate (ensure we’re not pushing low-quality completions).\n3. Segment drop-off: by device, source, cohort, and error code; identify whether it’s confusion vs technical failure vs policy/permission.\n4. Instrumentation check: verify event fidelity + create a single dashboard with step conversion, time-in-step, and top failure reasons.\n5. User/partner quick signal: 5–8 targeted user sessions + review top support tickets to map the “why” behind the drop.\n6. 2-week MVP to ship:\n   - Improve step-2 UX for the dominant failure path: clearer instructions + inline validation + actionable error states (with retry), plus a “save and resume” if the step is interruptible.\n   - Add a lightweight guided checklist / progress indicator + preflight check (e.g., permissions/account readiness) before the user enters the step.\n   - Ensure measurement: event taxonomy + A/B (or phased rollout) with guardrails.\n7. Rollout plan: 10% → 50% → 100% with monitoring; rollback criteria tied to guardrails.\n8. Explicitly NOT doing in iteration 1:\n   - No full redesign of the entire onboarding.\n   - No new integrations/partners (keep scope tight).\n   - No major backend re-architecture unless required to fix a top error causing most drop-off.\n9. Post-launch: readout within 48–72h of full rollout; decide whether to iterate on copy/flow, tackle next failure mode, or expand to adjacent steps.\n\nIf this maps closely enough to your problem space, I’d love to schedule the 15–20 minute chat—happy to go deeper on how I’d run the operating cadence, handle tradeoffs, and what I’d measure week-by-week.\n\n[TALK]",

I’ll come prepared on Day 2 with concise answers; below is a brief preview so you can see my current thinking (and I’ll align it to the 1-pager you’ll receive midday Day 1).\n\n1) Tradeoff + MVP choice (2-week MVP): I’d pick **(b) reworked error states + guided troubleshooting for the top 2 auth/permission failures**.\n- Why: those failures are typically the largest *addressable* share of Step-2 drop-off, and improving them moves the primary metric (verified successful connections) quickly while protecting guardrails (error rate, support contacts, downstream quality).\n- It also directly reduces “Unknown/Other” by forcing clearer categorization (provider_error_code/http_status + user_action) and giving users an actionable path rather than silent abandonment.\n- I’d still include “minimum viable” messaging for eligibility/KYC/risk blocks (what happened + next step), but the main engineering/design focus in the 2-week MVP would be the top auth/permission paths.\n\n2) Causality + measurement checks (avoid shifting to Unknown/Other / low-quality connections):\n- **Unknown/Other audit:** track Unknown/Other as % of Step-2 failures overall and by device/os + entry_source; confirm reduction target (30–50% rel / ≤10% ceiling). Sample checks: Unknown/Other correlated with missing provider_error_code/http_status or missing user_action ⇒ instrumentation gap.\n- **Failure-mode integrity:** ensure failure_bucket aligns with provider_error_code/http_status distributions (e.g., auth failures should map to known provider codes; timeouts should show elevated latency_ms p90).\n- **Low-quality connection check:** monitor **Activated/Connected** rate and **time-to-first-success p90** for connected users; rollback if “connections” rise but Activated/Connected drops materially or p90 regresses >5%.\n- **Guardrails in ramp:** monitor auth failure rate (stop if >10% rel increase), support contacts/new user (stop if >5% rel), and any sev-1/2 pause.\n\n3) Policy/compliance blocks (eligibility mismatch, KYC incomplete, risk/abuse flags):\n- **Messaging:** be specific on required next action without disclosing sensitive risk logic (e.g., “This account isn’t eligible for connection yet—check plan/region requirements” / “Verification required—complete KYC to proceed” / “We can’t complete connection right now—contact support for help”). Avoid revealing abuse heuristics.\n- **Instrumentation:** always set block_reason (eligibility vs KYC vs risk/abuse) + failure_bucket, with reason-code coverage to reduce Unknown/Other; ensure user_action captures abandon vs explicit denial.\n- **Operational workflow:** route only the cases that truly need human help (e.g., risk/abuse or ambiguous eligibility) via targeted support entrypoints; deflect the rest with self-serve next-best-actions and preflight checks to keep support contacts within +5%.\n\nI’ll send the 1-page decision doc as soon as it’s ready (still targeting midday ET Day 1) and will incorporate your definitions/taxonomy/fields exactly. If you’d like, I can also include a one-line “if volume is low/high” adjustment rule for the ramp monitoring windows (time-based minimums + sample-based minimums) to make the rollout section fully self-contained.\n\nLooking forward to Day 2, 10:30–10:50am ET.
