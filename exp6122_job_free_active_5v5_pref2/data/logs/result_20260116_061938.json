We already rejected their earlier APPLY, and our top targets (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) may still be attainable given their preferences: Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 (after Company_E), Seeker_C ranks Company_C #2 (but is last on our list), Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank us last. So the best realistic upgrade over Seeker_E is Seeker_B; we should avoid locking our only quota with a lower-priority candidate unless forced. Since Seeker_E is only TALKing, we can keep them warm, request final lightweight info, and indicate a near-term timeline while we continue pursuing higher-priority candidates. Maintain optionality; no ACCEPT possible without APPLY anyway."

Here are the two items:\n\n1) Activation definition (“first key action”) + rules:\n- Activation event: “Created first project AND invited at least 1 teammate” within 7 days of sign-up (both required).\n- Inclusion: new sign-ups from web + in-product referrals.\n- Exclusion: internal/test accounts (email domain allowlist), duplicate sign-ups, and users who churned during setup due to hard-bounce/invalid email.\n- Attribution: activation credited to the sign-up cohort date; if invite was sent but teammate didn’t accept, it still counted (invite-sent was the behavioral commitment).\n\n2) Holdout / validating lift wasn’t channel mix:\n- We didn’t run a perfect randomized holdout (time constraints), but we validated via (a) channel-stratified cohorts and (b) a pseudo-holdout on unaffected segments.\n- Channel stratification: activation lift was directionally consistent across our top channels (Paid Search, Organic, Partner). Example (relative lift): Paid Search +12%, Organic +15%, Partner +13% (no single channel explained the overall +14%).\n- Mix check: channel share shifted <1.5pp in the post window; reweighting post results to baseline channel mix produced essentially the same lift (within ~0.3pp absolute).\n- Pseudo-holdout: existing users re-onboarding (returning accounts) showed no comparable step-change in activation during the same period, suggesting the effect was tied to the new flow changes.\n\nIf useful, I can paste a small cohort table (channel × week) with baseline/post counts and rates. Appreciate the quick timeline—happy to provide anything else you need to finalize.\n",

In this round only Seeker_E contacted us; no higher-priority seekers (B/A/D) are currently in our inbox, and we risk ending unmatched if we wait too long. Seeker_E has Company_C as their top choice, so acceptance would likely stick and avoid competition. Given the stated decision timeline (1–2 rounds) and lack of active higher-ranked candidates, we should keep Seeker_E warm but not accept yet because they have not applied this round and we still might attract Seeker_B/A/D. Continue TALK, signal near-final, and prompt an APPLY so we can accept quickly if we decide next round."
