To be fair to you and keep this crisp, here’s what I can commit to: I will give you a definitive update by the end of next round (Round 7). If we don’t have a firm “yes” from that pipeline by then, we’ll reopen immediately and move fast with you.\n\nOne quick question to prepare in case we do move: if you were to start next business day, what baseline metrics would you want access to in week 1 to measure cycle time / handoff reliability (e.g., ticket aging, lead time, incident counts, SLA misses), and what’s the first system/process you’d instrument?\n\n[TALK]",

Our quota is 1 and we are still unmatched, but accepting Seeker_E now would forclose the chance to match with any higher-priority seeker if they approach us in later rounds. Seeker_E has no competing deadlines, reducing the risk of losing them if we continue to wait. No other candidates contacted us this round, but given the market structure, higher-priority seekers may still be in play; therefore we should keep the seat open and continue the conversation, while setting a clear decision timeline so we don’t drift indefinitely."

I’d add/standardize a small set of required fields + stage definitions, then build a simple dashboard for throughput, aging, and handoff failure modes.

We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but accepting E now could block a potential match with higher-priority seekers if they apply later. However, given we are already at Round 7 and have had no inbound from higher-priority candidates to Company_C, the probability of landing Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D may be decreasing. Seeker_E has shown strong, consistent commitment (Company_C is their #1), no competing deadlines, and has provided concrete 60–90 day plans and metrics—high likelihood of conversion if we extend. Since Seeker_E is currently in TALK (not APPLY), we cannot accept yet; best move is to convert to an application now and be prepared to accept immediately if they apply, while signaling that our pipeline decision point is now. This preserves the option to close quickly and reduces risk of ending unmatched."
