As requested, here’s the concise 1-page write-up.\n\n1) Baseline vs. post-change metrics (directional):\n- Baseline: workflow cycle time was inconsistent and trending high; throughput was constrained by handoffs and rework.\n- Post-change (after rollout + 2 iteration cycles): cycle time decreased materially (on the order of ~20–30% directional improvement), throughput increased (~10–20%), and rework/defect-related back-and-forth dropped noticeably (qualitative + tracked via fewer reopen loops).\n- Reliability: we added lightweight monitoring (weekly dashboard + alert thresholds) to ensure the gains held.\n\n2) Scope/constraints + key tradeoffs:\n- Scope: cross-functional process spanning multiple teams (request intake → triage → execution → validation/hand-off). The problem was ambiguous because “done” meant different things to different stakeholders.\n- Constraints: limited engineering bandwidth, deadlines tied to a business milestone, and no appetite for a big-bang rewrite.\n- Tradeoffs:\n  a) Speed vs. completeness: shipped an MVP that removed the biggest bottleneck first, then iterated.\n  b) Standardization vs. flexibility: introduced a common definition of success + a minimal set of required fields, while allowing team-specific extensions.\n  c) Automation vs. maintainability: automated only the highest-leverage steps; kept the rest as documented, repeatable human steps to avoid brittle tooling.\n\n3) What I personally owned vs. delegated:\n- Personally owned: problem framing, stakeholder alignment, success metrics, prioritization, solution design, rollout plan, and the operating cadence (weekly review of metrics + issues). I also wrote the decision doc capturing tradeoffs and the measurement plan.\n- Delegated/partnered: implementation tasks to engineers/ops partners; I coordinated dependencies, unblocked decisions, and ensured instrumentation was added.\n\n4) What I’d do differently:\n- Start measurement earlier (instrument baseline sooner) to reduce uncertainty in attribution.\n- Run a tighter pilot with one team first to validate assumptions faster before scaling.\n- Spend more time upfront mapping edge cases that later surfaced as rework.\n\nGiven this, I’d like to re-apply formally for the role this round.
