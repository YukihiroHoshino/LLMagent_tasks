We really appreciate your continued interest and clarity.\n\nAt this time, we’re still proceeding with our higher-priority candidates for this single remaining spot, so we aren’t able to extend an offer to you right now. If we’re unable to reach agreement with those candidates (e.g., they match elsewhere or decline), we may reopen conversations quickly based on the information you’ve shared.\n\nThanks again, and I do encourage you to continue pursuing other opportunities in parallel.",

Seeker_E strongly prefers us (#1) and is ready to commit quickly, but accepting now would forgo the chance to match with higher-priority seekers if they become available. Given we are still active and there is no evidence higher-priority candidates are unavailable, we should continue to hold the slot and reject this application consistent with prior rounds, while encouraging them to pursue other options and leaving the door open if circumstances change (they can re-approach if we fail to close with higher-priority candidates)."

If your higher-priority candidates have matched elsewhere or declined, I’m ready to close the spot now.\n\nIf helpful, I’m also happy to jump on a quick call today to finalize any last details.

Given the risk of ending unmatched by holding out further, and Seeker_E has repeatedly confirmed immediate start, no constraints, and 24-hour sign, accepting now secures a match while still within our acceptable list. This is preferable to remaining unfilled if top candidates never apply."
