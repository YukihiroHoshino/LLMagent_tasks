We focus on social-emotional skills (friendship, self-regulation), independence (self-care routines), and gentle scaffolding of early literacy/numeracy through hands-on activities rather than worksheets.\n\nHours & flexibility:\nWe offer standard full-day hours with options for early drop-off/late pickup when arranged in advance. If you share the hours you need, I can tell you what’s feasible and what our current capacity looks like.\n\nWhat we value / who thrives here:\nChildren who do well at Nursery_E tend to enjoy exploration and benefit from consistent routines. For families, we value open communication, partnership with educators, and a supportive approach to helping children build independence.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be specific: your child’s age and any particular priorities (e.g., longer hours, outdoor focus, language support, separation anxiety)? If Nursery_E sounds like a strong fit, you’re welcome to apply—happy to guide you through the next step.",

I’m happy to share more about Nursery_E.\n\nDaily routines & curriculum (how we structure the day):\n- We run a consistent, predictable routine (arrival/free play → morning circle → learning centers/small groups → outdoor time → lunch → rest/quiet time → afternoon projects/movement → outdoor/free play/pickup).\n- Our curriculum is play-based and language-rich. We weave early literacy and numeracy into hands-on activities (storytelling, songs/rhymes, sorting/counting games, sensory play, art, building, and simple science exploration).\n- We use small-group activities to meet children where they are—supporting attention, turn-taking, and early problem-solving without a worksheet-heavy approach.\n\nSupporting transitions (starting nursery + daily separations):\n- We do gradual settling-in when possible (shorter initial days or phased separation) and align with family routines.\n- Key-person approach: a consistent educator is the main point of comfort and connection, especially during the first weeks.\n- We use visual cues and predictable rituals (arrival routine, goodbye routine, transition songs) to reduce anxiety and help children anticipate what’s next.\n- If a child is having a tough drop-off, we respond with calm, consistent reassurance and quick engagement in a preferred activity, then update families once the child is settled.\n\nCommunication with parents:\n- Regular check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when feasible, plus periodic updates on progress and wellbeing.\n- We value two-way communication: what you’re seeing at home helps us support your child at school (sleep, changes, worries, interests).\n- If something needs attention (separation anxiety, peer conflicts, toileting, etc.), we share observations early and agree on a simple, consistent plan together.\n\nTo tailor this to your situation, could you share:\n1) Your child’s age and temperament (e.g., slow-to-warm, very social, sensitive to change)?\n2) Any specific priorities (hours, outdoor time, language support, allergies, nap needs)?\n\nIf Nursery_E ends up being a school you’d like to keep as a strong option, I’m also happy to outline next steps for applying and what we look for in a good fit.",

We also do **scheduled check-ins** early in the term and as needed.\n\n4) **Timeline for offers/confirmations**\nWe can move quickly once we have your needs.

If you tell me your needed drop-off/pick-up times, we’ll confirm the exact option we can reserve.\n\n**Settling-in / transition:** We use a gradual, child-centered approach:\n- **Pre-start meet & greet** (short visit with you present)\n- **Staggered start** over the first few days (shorter sessions building to full days)\n- A consistent **key person** for your child, with predictable routines and comfort strategies\n- **Daily updates** during the first 2–3 weeks (how separation went, mood, eating/rest, friendships), plus a quick check-in plan if we see any sustained anxiety\n\nIf you’d like, share your child’s age and any key needs (nap routine, allergies, languages at home), and we’ll tailor the settling-in plan.\n\nWe’re happy to move forward with you.
