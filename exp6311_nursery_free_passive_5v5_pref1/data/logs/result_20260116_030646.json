If Nursery_E could meet those needs, we’d be glad to have you consider applying when you’re ready.",

Happy to share an overview.\n\nDaily routine: We follow a predictable rhythm (welcome/settling-in, morning circle, learning/play blocks, outdoor time, lunch/rest, afternoon small-group activities, and pickup). We balance child-led play with gentle structure so children feel secure while still exploring.\n\nApproach to learning/play: Our focus is play-based learning with intentional support for early language, social-emotional skills, and independence (e.g., turn-taking, self-help routines). Teachers observe and scaffold—adding materials, asking questions, and guiding peer interaction—rather than relying on worksheets.\n\nKey strengths: A calm, consistent environment; strong communication with families; and lots of hands-on activities (stories, art, building, sensory play) with daily movement/outdoor time.\n\nPlacements & waitlists: We fill spots based on availability and priority order. If a spot is not immediately available, families can be placed on a waitlist; if a place opens, we contact families in order. If you’re seriously considering us, you’re welcome to apply—an application helps us understand your needs (start date, schedule) and keep you in mind as openings arise.\n\nIf you share your preferred start date and schedule (full/part-time), I can tell you what availability typically looks like around that time.",

Parent_A’s top choice is Nursery_B, so they are less likely to target Nursery_C immediately.
