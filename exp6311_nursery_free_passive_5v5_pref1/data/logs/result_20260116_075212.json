Our guidance is calm and consistent—clear expectations, redirection, modeling, and positive reinforcement. We work with families on shared strategies if any recurring challenges arise.\n\n3) **Communication with parents:** We provide brief daily updates (highlights, meals/rest, notable moments), and we’re available for quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up. We also schedule periodic conferences and will reach out promptly if anything needs attention.\n\nIf you’d like, please reply confirming acceptance of the offer and any key details we should note (allergies, schedule needs, emergency contacts), and we’ll send the enrollment paperwork immediately.\n\nWarmly,\nNursery_B Admissions\n",
