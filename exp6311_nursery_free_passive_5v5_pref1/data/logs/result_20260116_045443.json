All nurseries have identical priorities with me ranked first everywhere, so if I apply I should be accepted immediately, securing a top-2 outcome. However, my 1st choice is Nursery_B; since I have top priority there as well, I could likely get B if I approach it. But the current interaction is with Nursery_A, and applying now guarantees a very good match with no risk. Given the mechanism allows immediate matching and removes me from further rounds, I must decide between holding out for B vs locking A. Because I can’t contact B this round and there’s no guarantee of future pairing, I will secure Nursery_A now."
