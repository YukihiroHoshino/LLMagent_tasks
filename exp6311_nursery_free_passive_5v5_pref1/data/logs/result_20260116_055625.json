Given all nurseries share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E among parents), I (Parent_C) rank behind Parent_A and Parent_B everywhere. Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_D, so if Parent_D is still unmatched they will likely apply and be prioritized below me? Actually D is below me in nursery priorities, so I would beat Parent_D at Nursery_D if we both apply. However Parent_A/Parent_B might also be unmatched and could target D ahead of me. Since Nursery_B is still available and is my 2nd choice, I should avoid committing to D now and preserve flexibility to apply to B if I get the chance. I have only talked to D before; no application yet. Best move: continue TALK to keep option open, lightly signal interest/fit, without applying."

That’s very aligned with how Nursery_D runs. Here are the details you asked for:\n\n1) Typical day (with outdoor time + rest)\n- Arrival & warm welcome (staggered drop-off), then free-choice play/centers to ease separation and help children settle.\n- Short morning circle (songs, story, simple calendar/weather, feelings check-in).\n- Small-group, hands-on learning (art/sensory, early numeracy through games, language/storytelling, nature/science exploration).\n- Outdoor time: we prioritize daily outdoor play whenever weather allows (often a longer block late morning). We also incorporate short “movement breaks” when children need them.\n- Lunch.\n- Rest/quiet time: we keep this predictable and calm. Children who nap are supported to nap; children who don’t sleep still have a quiet rest routine (books/quiet activities) so the room stays restful.\n- Afternoon: calmer centers, read-alouds, social play, and small-group activities; then pick-up.\n\n2) Social-emotional development + conflict resolution\nWe teach skills explicitly and consistently, using a calm, coach-like approach:\n- Emotion labeling and co-regulation: “I see you’re frustrated—let’s take a breath together.”\n- Clear, simple boundaries: we stop unsafe behavior immediately and state expectations in child-friendly language.\n- Turn-taking tools: timers, visual cues, and teacher-supported “first/then” language.\n- Repair & empathy: we guide children to make repairs (“Are you okay?” “Can we help?”) rather than focusing on blame.\n- Problem-solving scripts: “What happened?” “What do you need?” “What can we do next time?” We model and repeat—skills grow through repetition.\n\n3) What we value most for overall family fit\n- Partnership: families who communicate openly and collaborate with teachers (which you’ve already emphasized).\n- Comfort with play-based learning and gentle structure (routines + guidance rather than pressure).\n- Consistency: aligning on expectations around kindness, boundaries, and independence-building.\n\nIf Nursery_D is becoming a serious option, I’d love to learn a bit more so we can confirm fit and move quickly if you choose to apply: your child’s age, how drop-offs typically go (easy vs. slow-to-warm), and whether they usually nap. If you feel good about what you’re hearing, you’re very welcome to submit an application this round—our review is prompt, and we’d be excited to be considered by your family.",

Since our quota is 1 and we are currently unmatched, we should actively appeal to Parent_C and try to convert to an application while answering their questions thoroughly. Parent_C’s stated preferences place Nursery_D as 4th (after C, B, A), so they may not apply unless we differentiate on fit and approach. Provide clear details on routine, outdoor/nap, SEL/conflict resolution, and family fit; then invite them to apply and offer next steps."
