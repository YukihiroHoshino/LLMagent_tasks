We also emphasize gentle behavior guidance and peer relationship building.\n\nTo help me advise you best: what is Parent_C’s age, start date you’re aiming for, and any specific needs (schedule, allergies, language support, or developmental goals)?

Could you share your child’s age, preferred start date, and the schedule you need (full-time vs. which days)? If you’d like, we can also arrange a brief visit/virtual tour.\n\n[TALK]",
