Teachers coach in the moment, model language for conflict resolution, and partner with families on consistent strategies. We keep group sizes manageable so children get close guidance.\n\nHours & pick-up flexibility: Our standard day runs 8:30–15:30, with options for earlier drop-off and later pick-up depending on the schedule you need.

We then move toward a predictable “hello/goodbye” routine so your child learns that goodbyes are safe and consistent.\n- Separation anxiety: we use a consistent handoff plan (brief, warm goodbye; same script; comfort item allowed), immediate co-regulation with the key-person, and we redirect into a familiar activity. We also send early updates (message/call depending on what you prefer) so you’re not left worrying.\n\nPart-time, staggered starts, gentler transitions\n- Part-time can be possible depending on which days you need and whether it fits cleanly with our current schedule.\n- Staggered/gradual start: yes, we can often do a phased start (e.g., mornings only for a few days, then extend), and we can plan a later “official” start date with settling sessions beforehand when feasible.\n\nTo advise you accurately (and to hold the right plan), could you share:\n1) Your child’s age and any allergies/medical needs?\n2) The start window you’re aiming for (earliest/latest acceptable date)?\n3) Whether you’re considering full-time or which part-time days?\n4) Any known separation anxiety/previous childcare experience?\n\nIf Nursery_E is feeling like a strong fit, I’d encourage you to apply soon—since we only have one spot, we’d love the chance to move to the next step with you promptly.",
