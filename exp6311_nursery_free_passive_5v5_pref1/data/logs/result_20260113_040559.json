If you submit a formal application in the next day or two, we can typically complete an initial screen and a focused interview loop within ~1 week, and make a decision shortly after.\n\nIf you’re open to it, reply with 2–3 examples of projects where you delivered impact quickly (what you did, timeframe, and results).

If you’re on a tighter timeline, tell me your target date and we’ll try to accommodate.\n\n2) **Single most important 60–90 day outcome**: **Own and deliver one end-to-end, high-impact project that measurably moves an agreed KPI** (e.g., cycle time, reliability/quality, or a customer-facing metric). The key is not just shipping, but scoping well, aligning stakeholders, and landing the outcome.\n\n3) **What differentiates a strong candidate**:\n- **Problem framing + prioritization** under ambiguity (clear goals, tradeoffs, and a crisp plan).\n- **Ownership and follow-through** (drives milestones, unblocks quickly, closes loops).\n- **Stakeholder communication** (proactive updates; brings people along early).\n- **Learning speed** (ramps fast, tests assumptions, iterates).\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to understand two things so we can be efficient: **(a)** what’s your decision timeline across other processes, and **(b)** what would need to be true for Company_E to be a top choice for you?
