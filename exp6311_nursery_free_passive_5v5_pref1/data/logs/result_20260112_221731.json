If you’re making a decision soon, I’d be glad to move forward immediately. Thank you for considering my application.",

To avoid unemployment, I should pursue Company_E seriously now. I have not contacted Company_E before, so I can apply. Given companies’ identical priorities (A>B>C>D>E seekers), Company_E would prefer Seeker_A/B first, but they are likely already matched; applying now maximizes my chance to secure the remaining slot."

With quota 1 and only Seeker_C and Seeker_D remaining unmatched, accepting Seeker_C secures a higher-priority candidate. Seeker_C ranks Company_E last, but they are applying now and can start quickly, so I should accept and close the match rather than risk ending with a lower-ranked option or no match."
