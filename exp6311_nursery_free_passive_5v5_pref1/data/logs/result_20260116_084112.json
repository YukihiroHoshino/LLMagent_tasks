Children who nap are supported with a calm sleep routine.\n- If a child doesn’t sleep, we offer quiet alternatives (books, puzzles, table activities) so they can still recharge without disrupting others.\n\nMeals:\n- We keep mealtimes consistent and calm, supporting hygiene routines and age-appropriate independence (e.g., tidying up, trying foods without pressure).

I can’t promise availability later in the cycle—families who move from “interest” to **application** earlier tend to have a clearer path to securing a place.\n\n2) **What most distinguishes Nursery_D day-to-day**\n- **Staff continuity + key-person approach**: we prioritize stable classroom staffing and assign a consistent key teacher, which makes transitions smoother and helps children settle quickly.\n- **Outdoor time as a daily default**: we plan for outdoor play every day (weather permitting), not just “when we can fit it in,” and we use outdoor time for both free play and guided activities.\n(Also common parent feedback: our calm, predictable routines reduce end-of-day meltdowns and make drop-offs easier after the first couple of weeks.)\n\nIf Nursery_D is a serious fallback, the best way to keep it realistically available is to tell me two things: **(a)** your child’s age/start date, and **(b)** the exact days/times you’d need (especially if extended hours matter).
