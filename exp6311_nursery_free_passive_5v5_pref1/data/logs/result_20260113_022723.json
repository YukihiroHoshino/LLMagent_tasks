Our top priorities for this hire are: (1) shipping meaningful work quickly (strong execution and ownership), (2) crisp communication and stakeholder alignment, and (3) sound judgment—knowing when to go deep vs. move fast.\n\nWhat strong first 60–90 days looks like:\n- Days 0–30: ramp on our product, users, and internal tooling; meet key partners; take ownership of a well-scoped but high-impact deliverable and ship an initial improvement.\n- Days 31–60: own a larger project end-to-end (requirements → execution → rollout), including defining success metrics and coordinating with cross-functional partners.\n- Days 61–90: drive a roadmap slice independently—propose the next iteration based on data/feedback and set up a repeatable process for ongoing improvements.\n\nEarly projects the new hire would likely own include one core initiative that directly impacts a key business metric (e.g., improving a critical workflow, reducing friction in a top user journey, or accelerating a high-priority internal process). The exact project is tailored to strengths, but we expect real ownership from week 2–3 onward.\n\nTo make sure I’m aligning you to the right track: what kind of “immediate impact” work do you most enjoy—shipping product features, improving systems/processes, or driving analysis/strategy that changes direction? And what’s your timeline for making a decision this cycle?",
