If a family applies and we confirm fit/availability, we can finalize immediately rather than waiting.\n\n3) Fastest way to confirm/secure if we have availability later: The quickest path is for you to send an [APPLY] message as soon as you’re ready to commit to Nursery_D as a top choice. When we receive an [APPLY], we’ll respond the same round with [ACCEPT] if the place is still available (or [REJECT] if it has already been filled). \n\nTo keep you “actively on the short list,” could you share your child’s age, preferred start date, and the drop-off/pick-up window you’d need most weeks?
