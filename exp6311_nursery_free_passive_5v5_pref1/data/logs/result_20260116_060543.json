For moves between rooms/age groups, we do short “visit” sessions and introduce new teachers in advance.\n\nTo gauge fit, could you share your child’s age and any priorities (e.g., longer outdoor time, language support, nap needs, shyness/transition concerns)?

If anything changes on our side, we would contact you directly right away.\n\nIf you share your required start date and the hours you need, I can also suggest a couple of nearby alternatives that tend to match families looking for a warm but structured setting with consistent communication.",
