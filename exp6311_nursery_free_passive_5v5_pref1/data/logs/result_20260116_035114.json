I’m happy to share more so you can gauge fit.\n\nDaily routine: We keep a consistent, calm rhythm—arrival and free play, a short morning circle (songs/stories), child-led activity stations (sensory, art, early literacy/numeracy through play), outdoor time every day (weather permitting), lunch, rest/quiet time, then afternoon play and pick-up. We emphasize predictable transitions and lots of hands-on, play-based learning.\n\nStaff-to-child ratio: We prioritize close supervision and warm interactions. Ratios vary slightly by age group, but we staff to maintain small-group attention and consistent key-person coverage. If you tell me your child’s age, I can share the specific ratio and room structure.\n\nSettling-in (transition) approach: We use a gradual settling-in plan tailored to each child—typically short visits with a parent/caregiver at first, then brief separations, building up over 1–2 weeks (faster or slower depending on the child). A designated key person supports your child and we keep communication frequent (quick check-ins + updates).\n\nHours & flexibility: Our standard day runs during typical working hours, and we can often accommodate early drop-off/late pick-up in limited slots depending on staffing and capacity. If you share the times you’d need, I can confirm what’s currently feasible.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be precise: What is your child’s age and start timeline? And what schedule (days/times) are you aiming for?\n\n[TALK]",

We aim to keep the day-to-day experience feeling calm and well-supervised, especially during arrival, outdoor time, and lunch/rest.\n\n2) **Social-emotional support & transitions**: We use a consistent routine and clear cues (visual schedules, predictable “next steps,” and transition songs/phrases). Teachers actively coach skills like taking turns, naming feelings, problem-solving with peers, and repairing after conflict. For bigger transitions (starting school, moving rooms, separating at drop-off), we partner with families on a plan—gradual separation when needed, comfort objects, and consistent handoff routines.\n\n3) **Day-to-day communication**: We do **brief daily check-ins at drop-off/pick-up**, and we share **short updates** about meals, rest, mood, and notable moments. If anything needs attention (sleep changes, biting/hitting patterns, toileting, separation anxiety), we message promptly and set up a quick call or meeting rather than letting it linger.\n\n**Strong-fit qualities/circumstances** we see most often:\n- Families who value a **play-based, relationship-centered** approach (and are comfortable with learning happening through play and routines).\n- Openness to **two-way communication** and consistency between home and school (especially around sleep, toileting, and behavior support).\n- Willingness to collaborate during the first few weeks on **transition strategies**.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing, it would help me understand fit: what age is your child, and how do they typically handle (a) separation at drop-off and (b) transitions between activities?

If you share your child’s age group, I can confirm the exact ratio for that classroom.\n\nSettling-in (new children):\n- Gradual transition plan (shorter initial days if helpful).\n- A consistent key educator for the first weeks to build trust.\n- Clear goodbye routine and comfort strategies (favorite item, predictable steps).\n- Frequent parent updates early on so you know how your child is adjusting.\n\nHours & flexibility:\n- We operate on standard full-day nursery hours; we can sometimes accommodate limited early drop-off/late pick-up depending on staffing that term. If you tell me the times you’d need (e.g., earliest drop-off and latest pick-up), I can confirm what’s feasible right now.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately:\n1) Your child’s age and any allergies/medical needs?\n2) What schedule do you ideally need (drop-off/pick-up times, days per week)?\n3) Anything that helps your child settle (nap routine, temperament, comfort items)?",
