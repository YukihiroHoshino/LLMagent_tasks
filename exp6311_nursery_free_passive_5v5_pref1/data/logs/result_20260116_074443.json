If Nursery_D feels like a strong contender for you, I’d encourage you to submit an application soon so we can formally consider your family and, if it’s a fit, reserve the place.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: your child’s age, full-day vs half-day preference, and any key needs (nap, allergies, language exposure, support with transitions)?",

However, Parent_A is not in the remaining unmatched set, and Parent_B is also not remaining, so they are likely already matched elsewhere. Remaining unmatched are Parent_C, Parent_D, Parent_E. Parent_C ranks above Parent_E for us, but Parent_C’s preferences place Nursery_E last, making it very unlikely they will apply to us. Parent_D also ranks Nursery_E last and has explicitly prioritized other placements, so unlikely to apply. Parent_E has applied and is ready to commit; accepting secures a match with minimal risk of missing out. Therefore accept."
