Commute matters mainly insofar as it supports punctuality and consistency. We do not have a formal sibling preference.\n\nTo strengthen your candidacy, it helps to share:\n- Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience\n- Your desired start date and weekly schedule needs\n- Any allergies/medical considerations or support needs\n- What you’re hoping your child gains this year (social, language, structure, etc.)\n\nIf Nursery_C is a serious option for you, you’re welcome to apply when ready—also, could you tell me where Nursery_C sits among your current choices and what schedule you’re aiming for?",

These are designed to be engaging and optional/low-pressure—children are encouraged, not forced.\n- Staff observe play and “extend” learning with questions, vocabulary, and gentle challenges.\n\n**Outdoor time**\nWe aim for **daily outdoor play** (weather permitting), typically at least once a day and often twice. Outdoor time includes gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n\n**Supporting social-emotional development (SEL)**\nThis is a core focus for us. We support SEL through:\n- A **key-person approach** so each child has a consistent adult who knows them well\n- Teaching feelings vocabulary and simple strategies (e.g., breathing, quiet corner, asking for help)\n- Coaching children through conflicts (turn-taking, sharing, repair after mistakes)\n- Predictable routines and clear, kind boundaries to help children feel secure\n\n**Typical day (example schedule)**\n- Arrival & settling-in; free choice play\n- Morning circle (songs, stories, routine talk)\n- Small-group guided activities / learning through play\n- Outdoor time\n- Lunch\n- Quiet/rest time (age-appropriate)\n- Afternoon play/projects (art, sensory, construction, role play)\n- Snack, story, and calm pick-up\n\nIf you share **your child’s age** and what matters most (hours, outdoor focus, gentle separation, language support, etc.), I can be more specific about the age-group routine and how we’d support your child’s transition.\n\nIf Nursery_D feels like a strong fit, you’re very welcome to **apply this round**—we’d be delighted to consider you.",
