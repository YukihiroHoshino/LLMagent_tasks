Goal is to get it back on predictable delivery and remove bottlenecks.\n- **Project 2 (Weeks 4–12): Metrics + improvement plan for a key funnel/workflow.** You’d establish a clean baseline (what’s happening today), identify the top 2–3 drivers of delay/quality issues, and deliver at least one measurable improvement (process change, tooling, or coordination changes) with before/after reporting.\n\n2) **Biggest pain point right now**\n- **Coordination + clarity under time pressure.** We have strong people, but priorities have moved quickly and ownership boundaries aren’t always crisp—so things can stall on decisions, handoffs, and “who’s driving.” This role is meant to be the clear owner who turns ambiguity into an executable plan and keeps stakeholders aligned.\n\n3) **Interview / decision timeline**\n- We can run an **expedited process in ~5–7 days**:\n  1) **30-min call** (fit + what you want next)\n  2) **60-min working session** (light case: take a messy initiative and propose a plan/metrics)\n  3) **30-min stakeholder chat**\n  4) **Decision within 24 hours** after the final conversation\n\nIf this aligns, the fastest next step is: what type of work do you most want to own (product execution vs. ops/program vs. analytics), and what are the 1–2 “must-haves” you’re using to choose among your parallel options?
