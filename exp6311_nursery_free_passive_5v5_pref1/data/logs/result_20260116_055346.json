At round 3, only Nursery_B and Nursery_E remain unmatched, implying A/C/D likely filled with higher-priority parents (priorities are identical A>B>C>D>E for all nurseries). As Parent_B, I have strong priority (2nd) at any nursery, so applying to an available Nursery_B should secure a match and is preferable to risking ending up at Nursery_E (4th) or unmatched. I have only talked with Nursery_E so far and have not applied to Nursery_B yet, so I should apply now."
