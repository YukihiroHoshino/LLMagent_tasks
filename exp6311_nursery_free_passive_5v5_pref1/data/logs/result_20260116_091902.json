If you share your ideal times, I can confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nSocial-emotional support:\n- Consistent key-person approach so your child has a trusted adult.\n- We explicitly teach emotion naming, turn-taking, and problem-solving using stories, role-play, and coached peer interactions.\n- Positive guidance: clear expectations, calm boundaries, and restorative conversations after conflicts.\n\nTo help me give the most relevant details: how old is your child, and what matters most to your family (e.g., longer outdoor time, structured early learning, gentle transitions, flexibility for commuting)? If you’d like, we can also arrange a short visit or call this week.",

I’m glad to share more about Nursery_D.\n\nDaily routine: We keep a predictable, child-friendly rhythm—arrival/free play, morning circle, small-group learning (early language, pre-math, arts), outdoor play, lunch, rest/quiet time, and afternoon project/choice centers with story time before pick-up.\n\nAge mix & class size: We typically group children in close age bands to keep activities developmentally aligned, while still creating opportunities for gentle peer learning. Class sizes are intentionally kept small with consistent staffing so children get steady attention and smooth transitions.\n\nSpecial focus areas: We emphasize social-emotional development, early communication/literacy through play, and hands-on exploration (art, sensory, nature/outdoor time). We also support gradual transitions for new starters when helpful.\n\nTo see if we’re a strong fit, could you share (1) your child’s age, (2) the schedule you need (full-day/part-time), and (3) your ideal start date? Also, where are you in your decision timeline—are you looking to apply this week if it feels right, or still comparing a few schools?\n\nIf you’d like, I can outline what a typical week would look like for your child’s age group and what availability might look like around your start window.",

However, Parent_C’s stated preferences rank Nursery_D 4th, so they are less likely to apply unless top choices don’t work out. Since we have only 1 seat, we should keep Parent_C engaged, highlight differentiators, and gently probe likelihood/timeline while not committing. Continue with [TALK] and invite an application if fit, but also ask about their child and decision process."

We use short, developmentally appropriate small-group moments for early skills, with lots of child-led exploration and social-emotional learning throughout the day.\n\n2) Class size + staff-to-child ratio\nWe keep classes intentionally small with consistent staffing, and we add extra coverage during transitions (arrival, outdoor time, meals) to maintain close supervision and support. If you share your child’s age group and the schedule you need (full-day vs part-time), I can give the most accurate specifics for that classroom.\n\n3) Drop-off/pick-up flexibility\nWe offer a standard drop-off and pick-up window, and we can usually accommodate some flexibility (e.g., slightly earlier/later within a defined range) depending on staffing and the specific classroom routine. If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up times, I can confirm what we can support.\n\nWhat we value most in families for admission\nWe prioritize (a) alignment with a play-based, social-emotional approach, (b) clear communication and partnership with teachers, and (c) consistency—families who can support routines (sleep, transitions, attendance) so children settle in smoothly. We also appreciate families who are responsive in the enrollment process so we can plan staffing and transitions well.\n\nIf you’re deciding quickly: could you share your child’s age, the schedule you want, and your target start date?
