If you decide Nursery_C feels like a strong fit, you’re welcome to apply in a later round.

We prioritize social-emotional development, communication, and independence.\n\nOutdoor time is a daily staple (weather permitting), typically in two blocks—one longer session late morning and a shorter session in the afternoon—because we find movement and nature-based play really supports regulation and curiosity.\n\nFor language/arts, we do daily read-alouds, small-group storytelling, phonological awareness through rhymes, and lots of process-focused art (open-ended materials rather than “everyone makes the same thing”).\n\nTransition support at the start of the year includes staggered start options, short initial days if needed, a consistent key-person/primary teacher approach, and a gradual separation plan tailored to each child. We also share photo/notes updates early on to help families feel connected as routines settle.\n\nTo see if we’re a strong fit: what’s most important for your child this year (e.g., confidence with peers, language growth, outdoor play, structure vs. flexibility), and are there any sensitivities or routines we should know about?",

If you tell me the times you need, I can confirm what’s feasible.\n\n2) **Toilet learning / potty training**\n- We follow a **child-led, supportive approach** (no pressure), and we partner closely with you on timing and routines.\n- When a child is showing readiness, we do **regular, gentle prompts**, consistent bathroom routines (especially around transitions), and lots of positive encouragement.\n- We support practical steps like **pull-ups to underwear transitions**, reminders, hygiene/handwashing routines, and we keep language consistent with what you use at home.\n- Accidents are handled calmly and privately; we’ll send a quick note so you’re never surprised.\n\n3) **Illness policy + medication administration**\n- **Illness:** if a child has a fever, vomiting/diarrhea, or is too unwell to participate comfortably, we ask families to keep them home and we’ll contact you for pick-up if symptoms develop during the day. We also follow standard exclusion guidance for contagious illnesses and will notify the room if there’s a relevant exposure.\n- **Medication:** we can administer medication **only with written parent consent and clear dosing instructions** (and in line with labeling/prescription guidance). We log administration times/doses and store medication safely. For ongoing needs (e.g., inhalers/epi-pens), we set up an individual care plan with you.\n\nIf you share (a) the drop-off/pick-up times you’re aiming for and (b) your child’s age (and whether you’re already in toilet learning), I can be very specific about how we’d implement this for your family.
