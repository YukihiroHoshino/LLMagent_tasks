Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet activities so everyone can recharge.\n• Social/emotional development: We focus on warm, responsive caregiving; coaching children to name feelings; modeling turn-taking and gentle conflict resolution; and using small-group play to build friendships and cooperation.\n\nTo help me share what’s most relevant: what are your top 2 priorities right now (e.g., lots of outdoor time, calmer nap environment, communication style, support for transitions, etc.)? And do you have a preferred start date?\n\nHappy to stay in touch this round and answer anything you’re comparing across schools.",

We aim for a substantial block in the morning and often another shorter outdoor/gross-motor period later, depending on the day.\n- Lunch (family-style when possible; we support independence and positive mealtime routines)\n- Rest/quiet time after lunch: children who nap are supported; non-nappers have calm, quiet activities\n- Afternoon projects (art, music/movement, nature/science exploration) + pick-up\n\n2) Social/emotional development + managing conflicts\n- We explicitly teach core skills: naming feelings, asking for help, taking turns, using words/signs, and repairing after conflict.\n- Educators coach in-the-moment: we stay close, narrate what we see (“You both want the truck”), set clear boundaries (“I won’t let you hit”), and guide children to solutions (taking turns with a timer, finding another truck, trading, asking politely).\n- We focus on prevention: small-group play, clear routines, visual cues, and thoughtfully arranged spaces/materials to reduce bottlenecks.\n- We partner with families if a pattern emerges, aligning on consistent language and strategies.\n\n3) Communication with families (updates, conferences, involvement)\n- Daily: quick drop-off/pick-up check-ins, plus brief day highlights (and meals/rest notes as needed).\n- Ongoing: open two-way communication—if anything comes up (friendship issues, transitions, behavior patterns), we reach out early.\n- Scheduled: periodic conferences to review development and goals.\n- Parent involvement: welcomed but not required—optional events (e.g., reading day/cultural share) and occasional classroom support opportunities, always flexible.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise on fit and timing:\n- Your child’s age and any key needs (nap routine, allergies, language support, transition concerns)?\n- If Nursery_D feels right, when would you be ready to submit an application?\n\nWith our single spot, we do expect interest—so if you’re considering moving quickly, I’m happy to outline the next steps right away.",
