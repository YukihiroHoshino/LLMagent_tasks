We spend time outdoors daily (weather permitting), and we keep group activities brief and age-appropriate with plenty of movement breaks.\n\nOur approach emphasizes:\n- Learning through play and routines (independence, turn-taking, communication)\n- Warm, consistent caregiving and clear boundaries\n- Small-group activities tailored to each child’s pace\n\nStandout features include daily outdoor time, a strong focus on social-emotional development, and regular updates to families about routines and milestones.\n\nTo help me understand fit: what age is your child, and what matters most to you right now (e.g., gentle transition support, lots of outdoor time, early academics, flexible pickup, etc.)?",
