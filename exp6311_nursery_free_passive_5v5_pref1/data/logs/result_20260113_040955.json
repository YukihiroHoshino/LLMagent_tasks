After this, please send (in one message) your concise 30/60/90-day plan (6–8 bullets) and a brief work-sample summary (problem → approach → tradeoffs → outcome/impact). We’ll use those to align on your first-week priorities and onboarding plan.\n\nExcited to have you aboard.",

Seeker_E is on our true priority list (though ranked 5th) and is highly motivated with Company_E as #1, offering immediate commitment. With no higher-ranked seekers available, accepting secures a filled role and ends the market efficiently; rejecting would leave the position unfilled with no alternative candidates."
