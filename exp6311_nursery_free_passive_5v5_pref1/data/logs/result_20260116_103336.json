              "message": "Hi Parent_D—thank you for the transparency. I’m glad you’re still considering us, and I’m happy to lay this out clearly so you can decide quickly.\n\n(1) Core daily schedule (typical)\n- Arrival & settling-in: child-led play/centers + teacher check-ins\n- Morning meeting/circle: songs/story, social-emotional routines, plan for the day\n- Learning blocks: rotating centers + small-group activities (early language/literacy, early math concepts, art/sensory, practical life)\n- Outdoor time: we aim for daily outdoor play (often a mid-morning block; weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time: nap/rest period; quiet alternatives for non-sleepers\n- Afternoon: project/play-based exploration, music/movement, and often a second outdoor block when possible\n- Pick-up / extended care\n\n(2) Hours / aftercare options\nWe offer a standard school-day schedule, and we can typically support extended-care before/after the core day depending on the exact times you need. If you tell me your ideal drop-off and pick-up times (and days per week), I’ll confirm availability for your specific schedule right away.\n\n(3) What makes a family a strong fit for Nursery_B\n- Partnership and communication: responsive, collaborative, consistent follow-through\n- Alignment on guidance: warm, respectful boundaries (empathy + clear expectations)\n- Reliability on schedule and openness to working together on transitions/developmental needs if they arise\n\nVisit/observation\nYes—brief observations are possible. The next openings we can offer are:\n- Option 1: a morning window (best to see routine/centers)\n- Option 2: an early afternoon window (to see rest/quiet time transition + afternoon play)\nShare 2–3 time windows that work for you in the next few days and your preferred time of day, and we’ll lock in the earliest slot.\n\nTwo quick items so we can move fast:\n1) What drop-off/pick-up times do you need (and do you need extended care)?\n2) If the visit feels like a good fit, are you ready to submit an application immediately after?\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Parent_D is 4th on Nursery_B’s true priority list (A, B, C, D, E). With quota 1 and only Parent_C and Parent_D remaining unmatched, Parent_C is higher priority but may match elsewhere (Parent_C ranks Nursery_C first). Keep Parent_D engaged and encourage an application while quickly confirming fit and offering a visit; do not accept unless they apply. Provide clear schedule/hours/fit criteria and propose concrete observation slots to accelerate decision."

Priorities are identical across nurseries (A>B>C>D>E), placing me behind A/B/C everywhere; however, those parents likely already matched since only Nursery_B remains. I have only talked so far and have not applied yet, so I should apply now and signal strong commitment while noting prior attempts to learn details."
