We focus on play-based learning that builds communication, curiosity, self-regulation, and social skills.\n\n**Communication with parents:** We prioritize consistent, two-way communication. You can expect brief daily updates at pickup/drop-off, plus regular written/photo updates on what children explored and how they’re progressing. We also schedule check-ins early in the term and are always available for a quick call/message if something comes up.\n\n**Typical class size:** We keep groups intentionally small to support individual attention and strong relationships. Class size varies slightly by age group and enrollment, but we aim for a close-knit setting with a strong adult presence so children are well-supported throughout the day.\n\n**Supporting transitions (first weeks):** We use a gradual, child-centered transition plan—shorter initial stays if needed, a consistent key-person approach, predictable routines, comfort objects welcomed, and lots of reassurance and relationship-building. We also coordinate closely with you on what helps your child (sleep, separation routines, sensitivities, favorite activities) and adjust the plan as we learn what they respond to.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and any particular needs or preferences (e.g., nap routines, separation anxiety, language environment). I can describe how we’d tailor the first two weeks for them. And if Nursery_C feels like a strong fit, we’d be glad to receive an application from you.",
