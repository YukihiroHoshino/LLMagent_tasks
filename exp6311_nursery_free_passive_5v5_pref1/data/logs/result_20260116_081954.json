              "message": "Hello Parent_C—thank you for reaching out. I’m glad Nursery_D is on your list, and I’m happy to share details.\n\nDaily schedule (typical full day):\n- Drop-off window: usually 8:00–9:00 (we can discuss earlier/later options depending on term staffing)\n- Morning settling-in & free play\n- Circle time (songs, stories, routines)\n- Learning-through-play centers (language, early numeracy, sensory, art, fine-motor)\n- Outdoor play (weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Nap/quiet rest: typically ~12:30–2:00 (we support both nappers and non-nappers with quiet activities)\n- Afternoon small-group activities (crafts, music/movement, early literacy)\n- Snack\n- Outdoor/active play\n- Pick-up window: usually 3:00–5:30\n\nMeals:\n- We support family-provided packed lunches/snacks and can accommodate common dietary needs/allergies with clear plans. If you share any dietary restrictions, I can explain how we handle them.\n\nOutdoor time:\n- We aim for at least one substantial outdoor block daily, often two (morning + late afternoon), subject to weather/safety. On poor-weather days we replace it with indoor gross-motor activities.\n\nEarly learning vs. free play:\n- Our approach is play-based with gentle structure. Children get meaningful free-play time daily, and we also run short, developmentally appropriate guided activities (small groups) to build early communication, social skills, curiosity, and foundational pre-literacy/numeracy—without pushing formal academics too early. We observe children and adjust activities to their interests and developmental stage.\n\nTransition / settling-in plan (first 1–2 weeks):\n- Gradual start when possible (shorter initial days, then extending)\n- A consistent “key person” approach so your child has a familiar adult for comfort and routines\n- Predictable daily rhythm and visual/verbal cues for transitions\n- Extra check-ins at drop-off and pick-up, with quick updates to families\n- Comfort items allowed (where appropriate) and supportive strategies for separation anxiety\n- If challenges come up, we coordinate a tailored plan with you (timing, routines, preferred calming strategies)\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be precise about fit and availability: your child’s age, your preferred start date, and the hours you need (earliest drop-off/latest pick-up). If Nursery_D is becoming a top option for you, feel free to submit an application when ready so we can move quickly on next steps.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is #3 on our true priority list (A, B, C, D, E). With quota 1 still open and no matches yet, we should engage actively, answer thoroughly, and encourage an application soon. Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 4th, so we need to differentiate on schedule, outdoor time, play-based learning, and transition support to improve our chances, while keeping the conversation open via [TALK] since they have not applied."
