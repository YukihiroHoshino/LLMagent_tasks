We use small-group activities and observation-based support so children can progress at their own pace.\n• Key enrollment dates: we encourage families to complete visits/conversations early; decisions are typically made on a rolling basis as places open, and we recommend submitting an application as soon as you feel Nursery_D could be a fit.\n\nTo tailor details: what is your child’s age and what kind of day (full-day/half-day) are you looking for?

Because the exact classroom assignment depends on your child’s age at start, please tell me your child’s age (or birth month/year), and I’ll confirm the specific classroom ratio you’d be in. As a general rule, younger rooms have more staff per child; older rooms have slightly larger groups.\n\n3) Flexibility on start dates/hours\n- Start dates: we can often accommodate a range of start dates (immediate start, start of next month, or a later agreed date), depending on the classroom opening.\n- Hours: we offer standard full-day care with set drop-off/pick-up windows; limited flexibility is sometimes possible depending on staffing and your needs.

When we have a confirmed opening that matches a child’s age/start date, we typically move quickly:\n- We contact families in priority order for that opening,\n- If a family is ready, we can usually confirm within a short window (often a few days) after the offer is made.\n\nTo give you the most accurate “how fast can we finalize” answer: what is your child’s age, and what start date are you targeting?

Educators observe, guide in small groups, and support social-emotional development (confidence, turn-taking, communication) alongside early literacy/numeracy foundations.\n\n2) Staff-to-child ratios (typical)\nWe staff to support close supervision and small-group work. As a general guide:\n• Ages ~2–3: typically 1:4–1:6 depending on the time of day/activity\n• Ages ~3–5: typically 1:6–1:8\n(We adjust staffing for transitions, outdoor time, and when additional support is needed.) If you share your child’s age, I can tell you what ratio you should expect most of the day.\n\n3) Start-date + hours flexibility\n• Start dates: some flexibility when space allows; we can often coordinate a start window rather than a single fixed date.\n• Transition/orientation: we can do a gradual start (short initial sessions, optional caregiver stay-in if helpful, then phased increase).\n• Hours: we can discuss half-day vs full-day needs and the specific drop-off/pick-up window you’re aiming for.\n\nTimeline for filling our remaining spot + application timing\nWe’re filling our final place on a rolling basis, and we expect to make a decision soon.
