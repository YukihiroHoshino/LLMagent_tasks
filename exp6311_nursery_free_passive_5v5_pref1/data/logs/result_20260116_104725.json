If you share your child’s age and any specific needs, I can give the most accurate ratio for that classroom.\n\nStart-date flexibility:\n- We can often accommodate a start date within a reasonable window (e.g., immediate start if a seat is available, or a phased transition over 1–2 weeks). We also try to support staggered starts for settling-in.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise precisely:\n1) Your child’s age and preferred schedule (full-time/part-time, drop-off/pick-up times)?\n2) Ideal start date range (and whether you need a firm date)?\n3) Any allergies, language considerations, or support needs we should plan for?\n\nIf it helps, we can also arrange a brief visit/virtual tour so you can see the classroom flow before deciding.",

Because we can’t reliably “hold” places for later rounds, applying earlier generally gives you the best chance to be considered if Nursery_D is a serious option for you.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child’s age/temperament and what you’re most hoping for in a nursery (e.g., schedule needs, approach to outdoor time, language environment).
