However, higher-priority seekers (A/B/C) may still be attainable later; accepting now would foreclose that option. Given the early round and identical company priorities, it’s plausible Seeker_A/B/C will apply to their top choices (not us), so waiting could be risky but may yield a better match. Still, Seeker_D’s strong interest in us increases match security. Decide to accept to secure a solid candidate rather than gamble in round 1."
