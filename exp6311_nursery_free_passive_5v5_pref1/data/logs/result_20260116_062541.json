Teachers rotate to scaffold learning.\n- Outdoor time every day (weather permitting): we aim for a substantial block in the morning and often a shorter session later as well. Outdoors includes gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n- Lunch & rest/quiet time: rest is flexible to children’s needs.\n- Afternoon: project work, small-group activities, music/movement, then pick-up wind-down.\n\n2) Social-emotional development & transitions\n- We explicitly teach SEL skills (naming feelings, turn-taking, problem-solving) through stories, role-play, and in-the-moment coaching.\n- Consistent routines with visual cues: children know “what comes next,” which reduces anxiety.\n- Transition supports: advance warnings (“in 5 minutes…”), songs/timers, and giving children a job (line leader, helper) to make transitions positive.\n- Drop-off: we use a predictable handoff routine, warm greetings, and a “settling” activity. If separation is hard, we partner with you on a plan (short goodbyes, comfort object if helpful, consistent staff support).\n\nStrengths / what we’re most known for\n- A structured-but-playful environment: children get both freedom to explore and clear routines.\n- Language-rich teaching: lots of conversation, storytelling, and vocabulary building throughout the day.\n- Strong focus on independence: self-care routines, choice-making, and responsibility in age-appropriate ways.\n\nTo help me understand fit (and to make sure we can support your child well), could you share your child’s age and anything we should know (allergies, languages spoken at home, any transition needs)?

Most days children get at least one longer outdoor session, and often a second shorter session later in the day. We use outdoor time for both free play and guided gross-motor activities.\n\n2) Approach to early learning (play-based vs. structured)\n- Our approach is primarily play-based and child-led, with gentle structure and clear routines.\n- Teachers set up inviting learning areas and small-group activities that build early language, social-emotional skills, and foundational numeracy/literacy through play.\n- We do use short, age-appropriate group moments (circle time, story time), but we avoid long “sit-and-listen” blocks.\n\n3) Class size / teacher-to-child ratios\n- We keep classes small and aim for close supervision and strong relationships. Ratios vary slightly by age group and time of day, but we staff to ensure children get meaningful individual attention and safe, well-supported play.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and the start date you’re hoping for, and I can be more specific about the class grouping and typical staffing for that room.

Light rain/cool weather usually doesn’t stop outdoor play—children just need appropriate clothing (raincoat/boots, warm layers).\n- In heavier rain, high winds, or unsafe conditions, we switch to “gross-motor indoors” (movement games, obstacle courses, dance/yoga, etc.) so children still get active time.\n\n3) Drop-off / pick-up flexibility\n- We have standard drop-off and pick-up windows to keep routines consistent for children.\n- That said, we understand real-life schedules—if you occasionally need an early/late drop-off/pick-up, we try to accommodate where staffing and safeguarding procedures allow. If you share your typical schedule needs (and how often you anticipate exceptions), I can tell you what would be feasible.\n\nTimeline for filling the remaining place\n- We expect to finalize our remaining place soon.

If we receive a formal application that looks like a strong fit, we can typically make a decision quickly (often within about a week, depending on scheduling a short visit/meeting if needed). Because we only have one place left, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel Nursery_E could work—waiting too long can mean the spot is filled.\n\n2) Teacher-to-child ratio / class size\nFor your child’s age group, we run a small class model. Typical staffing is 2 teachers in the room, and the group size is generally in the low-to-mid teens (we aim to keep it comfortably managed so children get close attention). If you tell me your child’s exact age (and start date), I can confirm the specific classroom and the expected ratio for that group.\n\n3) Outdoor time in a normal week\nWeather permitting, children go outside every day. Most weeks that looks like:\n- At least one substantial outdoor block daily, and\n- Often a second shorter outdoor session on many days.\nSo in a typical week, families can expect outdoor play on all 5 days, with multiple outdoor periods on several of those days.\n\nIf you’re deciding whether to submit a formal application: what is your child’s age and your ideal start timing?

If a phased start is helpful, we can plan shorter initial days and build up to the full schedule over the first week or two.\n- Drop-off routine: we encourage a brief, consistent goodbye (predictable and calm). Teachers take over quickly with a welcoming activity the child chooses, so the transition doesn’t drag on.\n- We also use predictable classroom routines, visual/verbal “what’s next” cues, and transition songs/jobs to help new children feel secure.\n\n2) Day-to-day communication with families\n- Daily: quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up plus a short end-of-day summary (how they ate/rested, mood, notable moments). We can do this via an app/message thread and/or brief in-person notes depending on what your family prefers.\n- Ongoing: we reach out proactively if we notice patterns (sleep/behavior/peer dynamics), and we welcome the same from families.\n- Conferences: we offer scheduled check-ins during the year, and can always arrange an additional meeting if something comes up.\n\n3) Deadlines / next steps\n- We’re filling our remaining place on a rolling basis. With only one spot left, the practical “deadline” is when we receive a strong application and confirm fit.\n- Best next step: schedule a short weekday visit/tour, and if it feels right, submit an application right after so we can move to a decision quickly.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and your ideal start date (plus 2–3 windows for a visit), I’ll propose specific visit times and confirm the relevant classroom details.",
