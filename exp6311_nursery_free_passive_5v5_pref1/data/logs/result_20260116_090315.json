We use outdoor play for gross motor development, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n- **Lunch & rest:** after lunch we have a consistent wind-down routine (books, soft music). **Nap/rest is typically ~60–90 minutes**, with flexibility for children who need more/less; quiet activities are offered for non-nappers.\n- **Afternoon:** snack, another play/learning block, and often a second outdoor period.\n\n**Social-emotional approach:**\n- We focus on **emotion coaching** (naming feelings, validating, and guiding toward coping strategies).\n- Teachers explicitly teach and model **turn-taking, sharing, and conflict resolution** (e.g., “stop/ask/offer a solution” language).\n- We use **positive behavior supports**: clear routines, predictable transitions, and proactive support before challenges escalate.\n- We partner closely with families—brief daily updates plus more structured check-ins if something needs a deeper plan.\n\nTo make sure we’re a great fit, could you share your child’s age and anything you value most right now (e.g., lots of outdoor time, gentle transitions, strong academics/play balance, support with shyness, etc.)? If you’re considering us seriously, I’d also encourage you to apply—our best next step is usually a short visit/meet-and-greet so you can see the classroom culture firsthand.",

Exact class size/ratio can vary by age group and enrollment, but we structure staffing so children have consistent key adults and ample support during transitions, meals, and outdoor play. If you share your child’s age, I can be more specific about the typical classroom setup.\n\n3) Social-emotional development & handling conflict\nOur approach is proactive and relationship-based:\n- We explicitly teach feeling vocabulary, turn-taking, and problem-solving through play and stories.\n- In conflicts, staff stay close, keep everyone safe, narrate what’s happening, and coach children to express needs (“I don’t like that,” “Can I have a turn after you?”).\n- We use consistent boundaries (no hitting/biting) with calm, immediate intervention and repair (checking on the other child, practicing a better strategy).\n- We partner with families if patterns emerge, aligning strategies between home and school.\n\nValues / focus areas\nNursery_D is strongly play-based, with an emphasis on social-emotional learning, language through stories and conversation, and hands-on creative activities (art/music/sensory). We aim for warm structure: predictable routines with plenty of room for curiosity and child-led exploration.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and what you’re hoping for most (e.g., language, outdoor time, gentle structure), and I can describe how we’d support that specifically.
