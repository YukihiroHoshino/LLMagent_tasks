I’m glad you’re still considering Nursery_D, and I’m happy to share more detail.\n\n1) Daily schedule & learning approach (typical)\n- Arrival & free play / settling-in\n- Morning circle (songs, story, routines)\n- Guided learning centers in small groups (early language/literacy, early numeracy concepts, fine-motor, sensory/play-based exploration)\n- Outdoor/gross-motor time (weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Quiet/rest time\n- Afternoon creative activities (art, music/movement, pretend play, projects)\n- Pickup / free play\nOur approach is play-based and relationship-centered, with predictable routines and lots of hands-on learning. We focus strongly on social-emotional skills (feelings, sharing, turn-taking), language development, and independence/self-help skills.\n\n2) Typical class size & teacher ratio\nWe keep small groups with a lead educator plus an assistant in the classroom. Exact ratios can vary by age group and time of day, but we prioritize close supervision, consistent staffing, and stable routines.\n\n3) Supporting new children (first weeks)\n- Gradual transition when possible (shorter initial days/step-up plan)\n- A consistent “key person” to help your child bond and feel secure\n- Clear, predictable drop-off routine and a confident goodbye plan agreed with parents\n- Comfort supports (familiar item, calm space, consistent cues)\n- Communication: quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up and additional updates as needed in the early weeks, especially if separation is difficult\n\nVisits / open house\nWe can usually accommodate short weekday visits. If you share your availability (a couple of windows that work for you), I’ll propose specific times.\n\nTo confirm fit and next steps, could you share your child’s age, desired start date, and preferred schedule (full-time/part-time)? If Nursery_D is becoming a top option for you, you’re also welcome to submit an application so we can move quickly if a place is available.",
