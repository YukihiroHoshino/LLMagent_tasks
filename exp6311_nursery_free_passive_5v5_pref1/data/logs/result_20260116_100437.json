Teachers coach in-the-moment and then step back as children gain skills.\n- We use consistent transition cues (visual schedule, 5-minute warnings, songs/clean-up routines) and assign “helper” roles to make transitions smoother.\n- For children who struggle with transitions, we use individualized supports (first/then language, choice within boundaries, a comfort object, and predictable routines) and coordinate closely with families.\n\nDrop-off/pick-up flexibility & after-care:\n- Our standard window is drop-off around 8:30–9:15 and pick-up 4:00–4:30.\n- We can usually accommodate modest flexibility (e.g., slightly earlier/later) with advance notice, as long as it’s consistent and doesn’t disrupt key group times.\n- After-care: we have limited extended-day spots on certain days; availability can vary by term.

We typically have a predictable rhythm (arrival/free play, morning circle, learning-through-play centers, outdoor time, lunch, rest/quiet time, afternoon small-group activities, and closing circle). We use short, intentional group moments to build routines and early skills, but most learning happens through guided play, exploration, and conversation.\n\n**Social-emotional support:** We focus heavily on social-emotional development—helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking, repair after conflict, and build independence. Staff model calm problem-solving and use consistent language and routines. We also communicate regularly with families so strategies are aligned between home and school.\n\n**Drop-off / pick-up & flexibility:** We offer a standard drop-off and pick-up window with some flexibility for families who need it, and we can discuss **after-care options** depending on availability.\n\n**What we value in families:** We look for families who are collaborative and communicative, support consistent routines, and share a respectful partnership with staff—especially around social-emotional coaching and independence-building.\n\nIf Nursery_B could be a strong fit for your family, I’d encourage you to submit an **[APPLY]** so you’re formally considered as we finalize decisions this round.

If you share your child’s age, I can confirm the exact ratio for that room.\n\nApproach to early learning:\n- Play-based with gentle structure: we follow children’s interests while building routines that support independence.\n- Strong foundations in language, early literacy (stories, phonological awareness through songs/rhymes), and early numeracy (counting, sorting, patterns) embedded in play.\n- Hands-on projects to build curiosity, fine-motor skills, and collaboration.\n\nBehavior guidance & social-emotional support:\n- We use consistent, calm boundaries and teach skills explicitly (naming feelings, asking for help, turn-taking).\n- For conflicts: “stop” → name the feeling → state the problem → choose a solution (take turns, timer, trade, ask a teacher). Teachers coach in-the-moment and fade support as children gain confidence.\n- For transitions: visual schedule, 5-minute warnings, songs/clean-up routines, and “helper roles.” If a child struggles, we use individualized supports (first/then language, choices within limits, comfort object) and coordinate closely with families.\n\nTimeline for enrollment decisions:\n- We can usually move quickly once a family feels we’re a fit. If we offer a spot, we typically ask families to confirm within ~3–5 days so we can plan staffing and hold the place fairly.\n- If you have a specific deadline (work start date, move date), tell me and we’ll try to align.\n\nTo help me advise you accurately: what are your top 2 priorities this year (e.g., proximity, outdoor time, structure, extended hours), and what age is your child?

We keep the routine steady and provide lots of warm, calm co-regulation.\n\n2) Family involvement & communication\n- Daily communication: We share quick updates at drop-off/pick-up and provide a short daily note/summary (highlights like mood, participation, rest, meals, and any notable moments), especially during the transition period.\n- Proactive check-ins early on: In the first couple of weeks, we typically do extra touchpoints so you’re not left wondering how the day went.\n- Conferences/goal-setting: We schedule periodic parent–teacher conferences and are always available for additional meetings if something comes up.\n- Two-way partnership: We really value what you’re seeing at home—sleep changes, new routines, worries, or big milestones—so we can keep school consistent and supportive.\n\nIf a warm, consistent routine and strong home–school communication are top priorities for you, Nursery_C is a good fit.\n\nTo guide you on the best transition plan for your child, could you share:\n- Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience?\n- Your ideal start date (and whether you need full-time or part-time)?\n\nAlso, since we have only 1 place this cycle and decisions are rolling, if you’re leaning toward Nursery_C, applying soon is the best way to keep that option open.",

We keep the process consistent and transparent, and we don’t “hold” spots indefinitely because it’s not fair to other families.\n\n2) Timeline for offers/decisions\n- If a family is ready to proceed, we can move quickly. Once we’re aligned on start date and schedule, we typically issue an offer promptly.\n- Confirmation window: we usually ask for a decision within ~3–5 days of an offer so we can plan staffing and onboarding.\n\n3) Our strongest differentiators\n- Social-emotional + transitions: very consistent routines, visual schedules, and in-the-moment coaching for conflict resolution (simple steps children can learn and repeat). We’re particularly strong at supporting children who need help with transitions.\n- Daily outdoor time: we prioritize outdoor/gross-motor play every day (weather permitting), not as an “extra.”\n- Small-group, play-based learning with gentle structure: we balance child-led exploration with predictable routines that build independence.\n- Family communication: quick daily handoffs plus regular updates so home/school strategies stay aligned.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you honestly about next steps:\n1) What start date are you aiming for, and do you need any extended-day/after-care (which days/hours)?\n2) Where does Nursery_E sit on your shortlist right now (top choice, top 2–3, or more of a backup)?
