We also weave simple second-language exposure through songs/phrases depending on class composition and staff availability.\n\nIf you share what matters most to your family (e.g., more structure vs. more free play, extended hours, language focus, temperament/needs), I can be more specific about how your child would experience the day here—and you’re welcome to schedule a short visit/virtual chat as well.",
