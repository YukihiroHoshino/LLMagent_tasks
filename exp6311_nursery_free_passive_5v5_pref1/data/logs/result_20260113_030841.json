Concretely, that means: scoping requirements, sequencing work, driving decisions/tradeoffs, and delivering a measurable outcome within 60–90 days.\n\n2) **How we measure success (metrics + stakeholders)**\nSuccess is evaluated on:\n- **Delivery metrics:** hitting agreed milestones, quality of execution, and de-risking early (surfacing issues fast).\n- **Outcome metrics:** depends on the project, but typically one or two of: adoption/usage, cycle time reduction, reliability/defect rate, or a clear business KPI tied to the release.\n- **Stakeholder alignment:** your manager + key cross-functional partners (e.g., product/ops/eng depending on scope). We value concise written updates and clear decision logs so everyone stays aligned.\n\n3) **Interview / decision timeline from here**\nIf you apply, we can usually move from application to final decision in **~1–2 weeks**, sometimes faster if schedules align.
