That said, I can’t promise the spot will remain open if we receive higher-priority applications that we can confirm quickly.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: (1) where Nursery_C sits on your list (top choice vs. backup), and (2) your ideal start date and schedule needs.

We emphasize learning through play, routines, and hands-on exploration, with educators observing and extending children’s interests.\n\n2) Behavior guidance & social-emotional: We use consistent, calm, developmentally appropriate guidance—clear expectations, positive reinforcement, and coaching children to name feelings, take turns, and solve peer conflicts with support. When issues arise, we focus on teaching skills (e.g., “stop”/“my turn next,” calming strategies) rather than punishment, and we partner with families to keep approaches consistent.\n\n3) Availability & decision timeline: We have limited availability (one place total on our side) and expect to clarify our final offer within the next 1–2 rounds. If you feel Nursery_E could be a top choice for you, the fastest path is to submit an application when you’re ready.\n\nTo help us assess fit and timing, could you share your preferred start date and any key needs (hours, allergies, support considerations)?
