We look for families who align with a child-centered approach, support routines (sleep, meals, transitions), and are open to collaborating on goals like independence, kindness, and early language.\n\n**Key features of our daily routine:**\n- A predictable rhythm (arrival/settling-in, morning circle, learning/play blocks, outdoor time, lunch, rest/quiet time, afternoon activities, pickup)\n- Lots of play-based learning with guided small-group activities (early literacy, numeracy through games, art/sensory, music/movement)\n- Daily outdoor play whenever possible\n- Social-emotional learning (sharing, turn-taking, naming feelings, conflict support)\n\n**Space after initial allocations:** we do have a single seat overall, and interest is strong, so I can’t guarantee availability later. If Nursery_C is near the top of your list, it helps to know your timeline and how likely you’d be to apply if a spot is available.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you accurately:\n1) Where does Nursery_C currently sit among your top choices?\n2) What start date and schedule are you looking for?\n3) Any key needs we should be aware of (allergies, nap needs, language support)?",

We place a strong emphasis on outdoor time every day (weather permitting), including nature-based exploration and gross-motor play.\n\nKey things families usually appreciate/align with:\n- Consistent routines + warm, responsive caregiving\n- Plenty of outdoor time and movement\n- Collaboration with families on goals (toileting, transitions, behavior support)\n\nKey expectations for families:\n- Reliable drop-off/pick-up and timely communication\n- Partnership mindset (sharing updates that help us support your child)\n- Basic readiness items (spare clothes, appropriate outdoor gear)\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what you’re prioritizing most (e.g., more structure vs. flexibility, lots of outdoors, social skills, prep for primary school), I can be more specific about fit.
