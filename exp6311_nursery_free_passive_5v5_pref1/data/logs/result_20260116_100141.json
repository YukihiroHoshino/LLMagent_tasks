In the overall market, Nursery_C is Parent_C’s top choice and Parent_B’s 2nd choice, while Nursery_D is my top choice and likely still attainable because others rank it lower. Since all nurseries share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I (Parent_D) am disadvantaged at any nursery if higher-priority parents apply. I should not commit to Nursery_C yet; instead I should keep flexibility to pursue Nursery_D first, while signaling genuine interest in Nursery_C as a strong fallback if a spot remains. Therefore, I will [TALK] to learn fit and keep rapport without applying this round."

I’m happy to share more about Nursery_C.\n\n**Typical day & balance (free play vs. structured):**\n- **Arrival & settling:** calm handover and **child-led free play/choice time** to help children transition in.\n- **Morning circle (short, structured):** songs, stories, planning the day.\n- **Learning through play (mixed):** a blend of **open-ended play** (construction, role-play, sensory) and **small-group invitations** (early language/literacy, creative art, fine/gross motor). Children can often choose whether to join a small-group activity.\n- **Outdoor play:** substantial outdoor time most days (weather permitting).\n- **Lunch + rest/quiet time:** consistent routine; children who don’t sleep have calm activities.\n- **Afternoon:** more free play and/or a short focused group, then pick-up.\n\nOverall, we aim for a **play-based day with gentle structure**—enough routine for security, with plenty of time for exploration and child-initiated activity.\n\n**Social-emotional development & conflict resolution:**\n- We use a **key-person approach** so each child has a trusted adult who knows them well.\n- Staff actively **coach emotions and language** (“I can see you’re upset… let’s find words for it”).\n- For conflicts, we guide children to: **pause → name feelings → describe the problem → take turns proposing solutions → agree and repair** (e.g., checking on a friend, rebuilding together).\n- We reinforce expectations through consistent routines, visual cues, and lots of positive modeling.\n\n**What we prioritize in applications:**\nWe follow our stated admissions/priority rules, but in terms of “fit,” children tend to thrive when families value **consistent routines, collaborative communication**, and a **play-based environment** with gentle boundaries. We also pay close attention to how we can meet a child’s needs (e.g., settling-in support, any allergies/additional needs) so the transition is smooth for everyone.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, it would help to know:\n1) your child’s **age** and intended **start date**,\n2) any key needs we should plan for (allergies, nap routine, language support, etc.), and\n3) what you’re hoping your child gains most this year.\n\nIf Nursery_C is among your top choices, you’re very welcome to apply when ready, and we can also arrange a brief visit/virtual chat if that would be useful.",
