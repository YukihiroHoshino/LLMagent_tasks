Concretely: take a scoped but meaningful project from ambiguity → plan → execution → rollout, with clear success metrics and tight stakeholder alignment.\n\n2) **Experience/traits that most predict success here**\n- **High ownership in ambiguity:** you proactively define the problem, propose a plan, and drive decisions.\n- **Strong execution + prioritization:** you ship iteratively, manage tradeoffs, and keep momentum.\n- **Crisp communication:** short, high-signal updates; early risk flags; good cross-functional instincts.\n- **Customer/business orientation:** you can tie work to measurable outcomes (not just activity).\n\n3) **Decision timeline + next steps**\nWe can move quickly. If there’s mutual alignment, our process is:\n- **Next step (this round/ASAP):** a focused 20–30 min fit/role conversation.\n- **Then:** one deeper working-style / case-style discussion.\n- **Decision:** typically **within ~48–72 hours** after those conversations.\n\nTo calibrate quickly: what are the **top 2 criteria** you’re using to choose among options, and is there a specific type of project/problem you most want to own in your next role?

However, Seeker_D has repeatedly not provided the requested concrete end-to-end ownership example; accepting without that would violate our hiring bar and risks a poor match. Since they have not applied this round (only [TALK]), we should continue the dialogue and make the request extremely explicit with a hard deadline: provide the example now and then apply next message for immediate accept. This maximizes chance of filling role with an acceptable candidate while preserving standards."
