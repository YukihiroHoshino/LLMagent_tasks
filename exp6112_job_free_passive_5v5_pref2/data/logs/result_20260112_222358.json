You’ll meet key stakeholders, audit the current metrics/process, and produce a clear execution plan (priorities, milestones, risks).\n- Days 30–60: Ship an initial meaningful deliverable (a workflow/process improvement or product/ops initiative depending on the track), with crisp stakeholder comms and measurable impact.\n- Days 60–90: Expand scope—own the roadmap for that area, set/track success metrics, and drive 1–2 additional improvements while tightening cross-functional operating cadence.\n\n2) What makes a candidate an immediate “yes”\n- Demonstrated end-to-end ownership: you’ve taken ambiguous problems, made tradeoffs, and delivered outcomes (not just analysis).\n- Strong communication + stakeholder management: you can align people quickly and keep execution unblocked.\n- Data-informed judgment: you use metrics/customer signal to prioritize and can explain your reasoning clearly.\n- Bias to action: you move quickly, iterate, and learn without needing perfect information.\n\nTimeline from here\nWe’re aiming to make a decision within the next 1–2 rounds.
