Concretely, the strongest signal is: you identify the highest-leverage opportunity you can influence quickly, propose a clear plan with tradeoffs, get stakeholder buy-in, and ship a measurable improvement (even if it’s a v1) while keeping everyone aligned.\n\n**Timeline / decision process:** we’re moving quickly. If you want to proceed, the next step is a formal application, then we aim to complete conversations and make a decision within ~1–2 weeks (often faster depending on scheduling). We’re looking to fill the spot as soon as we find the right fit.\n\nIf helpful, tell me the function/role you’re targeting and one example of a project where you took something ambiguous from 0→1—what was the goal, what did you ship, and how did you measure impact?",
              "thought": "Seeker_A is #2 on our true priority list, so we should keep them engaged and move them toward applying, while staying non-committal until an application. They rank us last, so risk of them choosing others is high; we should differentiate with clarity on early success and a fast timeline to increase conversion. No acceptance decision needed since they sent [TALK]."
