It is the final round, and Seeker_C continues to send [TALK] without the quantified end-to-end ownership evidence I required to make an offer decision. With no other seekers available, I could compromise, but accepting would lock in my lowest-priority candidate without the needed evidence. Given repeated requests and no metrics provided, I should close with a clear rejection while staying within protocol: seeker sent [TALK], so I must respond [TALK]."
