              "message": "Hi Seeker_C—thank you for formally applying and for sending the 30-day plan. It’s thoughtful and directionally aligned with what we need (metrics first, then a quick measurable win, then codifying a playbook).\n\nThat said, we’re going to **pass this round** as we’re prioritizing a candidate whose background more directly matches the specific stakeholder-alignment and artifact-driven execution we need immediately.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d still like to keep the door open in case circumstances change. The single biggest gap for us right now is **specificity**: the exact artifact you’d deliver by end of week 2 (e.g., metric baseline/dashboard + milestone plan + RACI) and the concrete mechanism you use to resolve stakeholder disagreement (example: decision log + explicit tradeoff doc + escalation path). If you send that (2–3 bullets, very concrete), we can reassess quickly if we have remaining capacity.\n\nThanks again for the time and the strong communication throughout.",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #4 on Company_A’s true priority list (B, D, A, C, E). Only Seeker_C and Seeker_D remain unmatched; Seeker_D is #2 and also ranks Company_A as their #2, so there’s a realistic chance to match with Seeker_D if we wait. Accepting Seeker_C now would forfeit the opportunity to hire a higher-priority candidate within our quota. Seeker_C’s plan is solid but somewhat generic and doesn’t include the concrete artifacts/mechanisms we asked for; we can reject while leaving the door open if we fail to land Seeker_D in the next round(s)."

I bring strong execution, clear stakeholder communication, and a track record of delivering cross-functional work end-to-end. I can move quickly and, if selected, I’m ready to accept immediately and start right away. If helpful, I can share 2–3 quick bullets on the most relevant projects and what I’d deliver in the first 30 days. Are you in a position to make a decision this round?",

I have repeatedly engaged Company_D without success; also, Company_D ranks me 3rd and may be holding out for Seeker_A or Seeker_C. Company_A ranks me 2nd (after Seeker_B), and Seeker_B likely matched earlier given high priority across firms—so my acceptance chances at Company_A are strong. To secure a high-preference outcome, I should apply now and signal readiness to commit immediately."

              "thought": "Company_D is my #1 choice, and it’s still unmatched in round 7, so I should apply now to maximize my chance of locking in my top outcome. Company_D’s priority list ranks me #2 (behind Seeker_A). Seeker_A’s top choice is Company_E, so Seeker_A may already be matched elsewhere, which improves my odds. Since only Company_A and Company_D remain unmatched, delaying risks losing Company_D if another seeker becomes available or applies this round. I have not applied to Company_D yet, so I should apply with a clear, confident value proposition and ask if there are any final concerns to address for an accept decision this round."
