Our goal is to **finalize a decision within ~7–10 days**, and we can move faster if there’s clear mutual fit. If you **apply this round**, we can prioritize getting you through the process promptly.\n\n2) **What makes someone clearly stand out for an offer at this stage**:\n- **Clear ownership story in ambiguity**: a concrete example where you framed a messy problem, made tradeoffs, aligned stakeholders, and drove to a measurable outcome.\n- **Evidence of execution + impact**: shipped something meaningful quickly, with metrics (before/after) and iteration based on results.\n- **Crisp communication + cross-functional leadership**: you can keep teams aligned, unblock decisions, and communicate succinctly.\n\nYes—please send a **concise summary** (3–5 bullets) of your most relevant experience + 1–2 projects you’re proud of (scope, your role, impact metrics). If it aligns the way I suspect, I’d strongly encourage you to **apply this round** so we can keep momentum and get you in front of the hiring team quickly.",
