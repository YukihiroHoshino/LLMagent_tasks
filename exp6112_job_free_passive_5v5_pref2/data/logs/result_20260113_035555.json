Since Seeker_E has us as top choice, we can likely keep them interested even if we reject now, but rules require accept/reject on APPLY and no further negotiation if rejected. Given uncertainty of future rounds and that Seeker_E is acceptable, but not ideal, decide to reject to preserve chance at higher-priority Seeker_B/A.
