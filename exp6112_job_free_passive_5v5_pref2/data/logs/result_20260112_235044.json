              "thought": "Company_A is my #2 choice after Company_E, so it is worth pursuing seriously. Company_A’s priority list ranks me #2 (behind Seeker_B), so I have a strong chance if I apply now, especially before Company_A potentially accepts Seeker_B. Given the one-shot exchange per round, an early application can secure a high-ranked match without risking losing Company_A to another seeker."

              "thought": "Seeker_D is #2 on our true priority list (Seeker_B is #1). With quota 1, accepting now secures a very strong candidate. Waiting for Seeker_B is risky because Seeker_B ranks Company_A last and is likely to match elsewhere (Company_E/C). Seeker_D ranks us #2 and is applying directly, indicating high likelihood of mutual match. Therefore accept immediately to lock in a top-tier outcome."

              "thought": "Company_B is 4th on my true preference list (C, A, D, B, E). It’s on my list, but I should avoid committing this early because I have a realistic path to higher choices. Company_B’s priority ranks me 4th (after A, B, C), so my acceptance odds there may be weaker if others apply. Best move is to [TALK] to signal interest and learn about fit/timeline while preserving flexibility to pursue Company_C/Company_A/Company_D in later rounds."

In round 1 with no matches yet, we should keep Seeker_E engaged while preserving flexibility to pursue Seeker_A/Seeker_B if they become available. Since Seeker_E is only in TALK mode, respond with role details, clarify evaluation criteria, and signal a reasonably quick timeline without committing an offer yet."
