I have only talked with A so far (no application), and A’s priority ranks me 4/5, so my acceptance chances may be moderate if others apply. Best move: continue TALK to gather signal and keep option open while not prematurely locking in a lower-ranked match than E."

In the remaining unmatched pool (C, D, E), Seeker_D is ranked higher (#2) and also ranks Company_A as their #2 choice, so there is a realistic chance to match with D if we avoid committing now. Seeker_C ranks Company_A #4, so they may be harder to secure and could accept others (Company_D/Company_C/Company_E) first. Since Seeker_C has only initiated TALK (not APPLY), keep them warm but do not push to accept; gather info and encourage application while avoiding any commitment that blocks a potential Seeker_D match."
