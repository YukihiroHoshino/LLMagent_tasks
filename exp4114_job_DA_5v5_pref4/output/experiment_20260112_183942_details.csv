Given others’ preferences and companies’ priorities, applying first to Company_D gives me a strong chance (I am #2 in Company_D’s priority, only behind Seeker_B). If I lose Company_D to Seeker_B, my next best secure option is Company_B where I am #1 priority, followed by Company_C where I am also #1. Therefore I submit my true order: D, then B, then C, then A, then E.",True,Company_D,True,True,1

In the first round, Company_D will receive applications from Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_D, and me. Company_D’s priority ranks Seeker_D above me, so I expect to be rejected there. Crucially, Seeker_D will be accepted by Company_D and therefore will not compete for Company_E in later rounds. If I then apply to Company_E second, the only serious competitor for Company_E is Seeker_B (who applies to E first), but Company_E ranks me above Seeker_B, so when my application arrives in round 2, Company_E will switch to accept me. This yields Company_E (my 2nd true choice). Any attempt to rank Company_E first would lose it to Seeker_B in round 1 and then I’d be forced to compete elsewhere; ranking Company_C first would also be risky because Company_C ranks Seeker_D above me and Seeker_D could reach C after being rejected from D. Therefore the best strategy is to list D first, then E, then the remaining true preferences in order as fallbacks.",True,Company_E,True,True,2
