It typically includes diagnosing current pain points, proposing an approach, implementing changes, and validating impact with metrics and user feedback.\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of work are you hoping to do next (more execution-heavy vs. more ambiguous/0→1), and what’s a recent project you owned end-to-end that you’re most proud of?",
