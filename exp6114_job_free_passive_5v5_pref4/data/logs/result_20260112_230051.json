We’d like to move forward with you.\n\n[ACTION] Next, please send a brief (bullet-point is fine) 30/60/90-day plan aligned to: (1) owning a high-impact workstream end-to-end with clear success metrics, and (2) cross-functional execution/communication. Also include one concise example (problem → your actions → metric/result) that best demonstrates ownership + measurable impact.\n\nWe’ll prioritize scheduling interviews immediately after we receive that.",

Remaining unmatched seekers are Seeker_A and Seeker_C; Seeker_C is our 2nd choice, so we should preserve capacity for Seeker_C if possible. However, we risk ending unmatched if Seeker_C matches elsewhere. Given Seeker_A is still on our list and is proactively applying with immediate availability, accepting now secures a match within quota. With only one slot and uncertainty about reaching Seeker_C, accept Seeker_A."
