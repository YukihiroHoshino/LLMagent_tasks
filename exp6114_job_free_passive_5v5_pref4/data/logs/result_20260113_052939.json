However, with quota=1, accepting now may block a higher-priority match. Check likelihood of landing Seeker_D or Seeker_A: Seeker_D ranks Company_B #2 (after Company_D), and Company_D ranks Seeker_D #2 (after Seeker_B). Seeker_B ranks Company_E and Company_A above Company_B, so Seeker_B may not be stable if they had other options—but an accepted match finalizes. Seeker_A ranks Company_B #3 and Company_E ranks Seeker_A #1, making Seeker_A likely to go elsewhere. Seeker_D is the best target and plausibly attainable if Company_D matches with Seeker_B instead.
