Deliver at least one “quick win” to demonstrate momentum.\n- Days 31–60: Take primary ownership of a meaningful project/workstream, define success metrics, and drive execution with partners. Communicate progress crisply and unblock issues early.\n- Days 61–90: Ship a measurable outcome (or major milestone), document learnings, and propose the next roadmap of improvements based on data and stakeholder feedback.\n\nTo make sure we’re aligned on fit: what kind of scope are you looking for (more ambiguous/0→1 vs. optimization/scale), and what are your top 2 criteria in choosing among opportunities right now (e.g., growth, mission, team, comp, flexibility)?",

Two quick prompts to make it easy:\n- What’s one example where you drove a cross-functional project from ambiguity to measurable outcome?\n- Do you prefer 0→1 ambiguous problem spaces or optimization/scale work?\n\nIf what you share lines up, I’d encourage you to apply right away so we can move you through quickly.",
