I’m confident I can ramp quickly, take ownership of the immediate projects you need covered, and communicate clearly with stakeholders to deliver results in the first 30–90 days. If you’re open to moving fast, I’m ready to proceed right away and can start immediately. [APPLY]",

Only Company_A and Company_C remain unmatched; I already applied to Company_A, but Company_A ranks me last, so my chances there are weak if any other seeker becomes available or if Company_A prefers someone else. Company_C ranks me 4th, which is also weak, but since we are late in the process and options are narrowing, I should avoid stalling and secure a match if possible. I have only talked with Company_C so far and have not applied yet, so applying now is the best way to avoid ending up unmatched."

I’m Seeker_C, and I’m confident I can ramp quickly, take ownership of ambiguous work, and deliver measurable outcomes early through tight stakeholder communication and strong execution. If helpful, I can share a brief 30/60/90-day plan aligned to your team’s goals.

Company_A’s priority list ranks me #2 (after Seeker_E), and Seeker_E likely matched already since only A and C remain, improving my acceptance odds.
