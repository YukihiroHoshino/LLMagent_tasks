For this opening, our top priorities are: (1) owning a well-scoped set of deliverables end-to-end, (2) communicating clearly with stakeholders and surfacing risks early, and (3) building repeatable processes so results scale beyond one-off wins.\n\nA strong first 60–90 days typically looks like:\n- Days 1–30: ramp on our product/domain, meet key partners, and take ownership of a small but meaningful project to learn our execution rhythms.\n- Days 31–60: deliver that project with measurable impact, document the approach, and propose 1–2 improvements to how we operate.\n- Days 61–90: lead a larger initiative (or multiple parallel workstreams), set clear milestones, and become a go-to point person for a key area.\n\nTo tailor this: what type of work do you do best when you want to “contribute quickly” (e.g., execution/ops, analysis, stakeholder management, building systems), and what kind of growth are you optimizing for over the next year?",
