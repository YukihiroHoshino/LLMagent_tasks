Seeker_D also ranks Company_D as their top choice, so acceptance is likely stable and prevents losing them to other companies. With quota 1 and no prior commitments, accepting Seeker_D is a strong outcome even though Seeker_B is slightly preferred; waiting risks ending with a lower-ranked candidate or no match."

              "thought": "Seeker_E is #2 on Company_C’s true priority list (only behind Seeker_D) and is actively applying now. Waiting for Seeker_D is risky because Seeker_D ranks Company_C third and may match with Company_D or Company_B first, while Seeker_E ranks Company_C third and is willing to commit. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_E secures a very high-priority hire immediately and avoids ending unmatched."

With quota 1, we should preserve the option to match with higher-priority seekers (A, D, E) who may become available; however, Seeker_B is applying now and has us as top choice, making acceptance a secure fill. Given no prior interactions and uncertainty of landing A/D/E, but strong likelihood those candidates will prefer Company_D or others, we can accept Seeker_B as a solid on-list match rather than risk ending unmatched."

Since this is round 1 and I have higher-preferred companies (D, C, E, A) that I should pursue first, I should not apply to B yet.

Typically: initial conversation → next-step interview(s) within ~1 week → decision within ~1–2 weeks after that, depending on scheduling.

Seeker_C ranks us last, so they are unlikely to apply unless other options fail; investing too heavily may be inefficient. Still, keep them warm and gather info while we wait for chances with Seeker_D/A/B, who prefer us more (D ranks us 2nd; A and B rank us 3rd).
