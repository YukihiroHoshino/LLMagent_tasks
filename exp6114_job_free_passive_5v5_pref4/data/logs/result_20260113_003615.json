Communication is lightweight but high-cadence.\n\n**Success in the first 90 days:**\n- **0–30 days:** ramp on our domain, stakeholders, and current roadmap; ship one “quick win” improvement.\n- **31–60 days:** take full ownership of a core initiative; define success metrics and execution plan.\n- **61–90 days:** deliver a measurable milestone (launch/process change) and present results + next-quarter plan.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re looking for, we can move quickly: a short manager chat + a focused case discussion (kept practical, not time-consuming). What type of work are you prioritizing right now, and what would make Company_A a top choice for you this round?",
