In the first 30–60 days, success looks like:\n- Establishing a tight operating cadence (weekly milestones, clear owners, risk log)\n- Driving one priority initiative from “messy” to shipped (or to a high-confidence launch plan) with measurable reduction in churn/rework\n- Improving stakeholder alignment so decisions are documented and reversible where appropriate\n\n2) Background that tends to do best here\nWe’ve historically seen two profiles succeed:\n- Strong generalist executors who’ve led ambiguous, cross-functional projects end-to-end (even without our exact domain), and can quickly learn context.\n- Domain folks can ramp faster, but domain alone doesn’t win—execution ownership + communication are the real differentiators.\n\nIf you’re open to it, please share a quick outline of how you’d approach the first 60 days (even bullet points). In particular: how you’d diagnose the bottleneck in weeks 1–2, what artifacts/cadence you’d put in place, and how you’d define “done” for the first milestone. [TALK]",
