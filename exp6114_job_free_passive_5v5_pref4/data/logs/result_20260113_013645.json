At round 5, only Company_A and Company_B remain unmatched, so my top choices are no longer available; securing Company_A is preferable to risking ending up with Company_B (my last choice) or unemployment. Company_A’s priority list ranks me #2 (behind Seeker_E), which gives me a strong acceptance chance if I apply now. I have not previously applied to Company_A, so I should apply immediately with a concise value pitch and signal readiness to decide quickly."

Welcome aboard—looking forward to partnering.\n\n[ACCEPT]",

If selected, I’d align on your top priorities in week 1, translate them into a tight execution plan (30/60/90), and keep stakeholders closely updated as I drive the core projects forward. If helpful, I can also send a concise 30/60/90 outline tailored to your current bottleneck and key metrics.",
