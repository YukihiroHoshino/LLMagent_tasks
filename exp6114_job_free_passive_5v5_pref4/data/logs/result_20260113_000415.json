You’d have a clear owner for strategy/direction, plus close day-to-day partnership with peers; autonomy is high and expectations are outcome-driven.\n\n**What distinguishes a strong candidate**\n- Evidence of **shipping** meaningful work quickly (with examples and metrics).\n- Strong **prioritization and tradeoff** judgment under ambiguity.\n- Clear, proactive **communication** with stakeholders and teammates.\n- Takes ownership: identifies risks early, proposes solutions, and drives to closure.\n\nA couple quick questions to gauge fit:\n1) What’s an example of a project where you delivered a measurable result in ~90 days?\n2) Do you prefer owning a broad problem area or going deep on a narrower domain?\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re looking for, I’d be glad to move quickly—feel free to share those details and, if you’re ready, submit an application in the next step.",
