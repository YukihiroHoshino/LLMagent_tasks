At round 28, only Seeker_C remains unmatched; leaving unfilled is an option, but matching is better than vacancy if we can get the missing ownership signal. Process rules prevent ACCEPT on TALK. Best move: restate blocker succinctly and instruct to APPLY with required evidence; commit to immediate accept if evidence meets bar, otherwise reject to allow them to move on before round 30."
