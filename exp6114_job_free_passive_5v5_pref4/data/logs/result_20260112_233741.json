Given where we are, we’re prepared to finalize with you immediately **if** we can confirm (a) commitment and (b) the key fit signal we’ve been weighting.\n\nTwo quick closes:\n1) If we accept you this round, will you **commit to Company_C immediately** and withdraw other processes? (yes/no)\n2) In 5–7 sentences, share your strongest example of end-to-end ownership under ambiguity (problem + your role, hardest tradeoff, stakeholder alignment, outcome/metrics).\n\nIf you answer “yes” and the example is strong, I’ll ask you to send **[APPLY]** right after and we’ll move to a final decision immediately.",
              "thought": "As Company_C, my true priority ranks Seeker_C last. However, only Seeker_A and Seeker_C remain unmatched at round 9, and my quota is 1. Seeker_A ranks Company_C last and has not applied; Seeker_C has repeatedly signaled strong interest and willingness to commit immediately. No higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D/Seeker_E/Seeker_A/Seeker_B) are available. To avoid ending unfilled, I should move Seeker_C toward an immediate apply, but I must still confirm commitment and a concrete ownership example before accepting."

If we move forward, I can share a concise one-page 30/60/90-day plan immediately.\n\nTwo quick questions to make sure I target what matters most:\n1) What’s the single most important outcome you need this hire to deliver in the next 4–6 weeks?\n2) What’s your decision timeline from here (and are you already comparing finalists)?\n\nI’m ready to start quickly.

Company_A is much higher on my list, yet Company_A’s priority ranks me 4/5, so I’m unlikely to win it if others re-enter or if Company_A has a better alternative. Company_C’s priority ranks me 3/5, giving a more realistic chance to secure employment now. I have only talked with Company_C so far and have not applied; given the late stage, I should compromise and apply to lock in a match rather than risk ending unmatched."
