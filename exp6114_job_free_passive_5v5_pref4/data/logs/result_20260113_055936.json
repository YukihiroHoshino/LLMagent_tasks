This role would **own a defined, high-impact workflow end-to-end**—mapping the current process, aligning stakeholders on “what good looks like,” and then shipping improvements that move a measurable KPI (cycle time, quality, or reliability depending on the workstream).\n\n2) Hiring timeline / decision process\nWe’re moving quickly. From here, the typical flow is:\n- **Next step:** a focused 30–45 min conversation to align on scope + your strengths\n- **Then:** 1–2 additional interviews (cross-functional partners + hiring manager)\n- **Decision:** we aim to wrap within ~**1–2 weeks** after that, assuming scheduling cooperates.\n\nAnd yes—please do send a brief **30–60 day approach**.
