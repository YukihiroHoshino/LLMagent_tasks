This includes clarifying scope, aligning stakeholders, setting milestones, and shipping something measurable (not just planning).\n2) Improve our operating cadence/visibility for a key workstream: tighter written updates, clearer ownership, risk tracking, and decision documentation so teams stay unblocked and we reduce last-minute surprises.\n\n(2) What would make us confident by week 4\n- You’ve built a crisp problem statement + plan (milestones, success metrics, dependencies) for a real project we agree is high-impact.\n- Stakeholders are aligned (you’ve run the key syncs, captured decisions, and have a predictable update rhythm).\n- Early execution is underway: first deliverable shipped or a clear measurable movement (e.g., a pilot, process change, or a concrete artifact that unblocks downstream work).\n- Communication is proactive: risks surfaced early with proposed mitigations, and status is easy to understand asynchronously.\n\nIf this matches what you want, we can move quickly.

Company_D ranks me #1 in its priority list, making acceptance highly likely if I apply. Since I have not applied to Company_D yet and it is on my preference list, I should apply to lock in a match rather than risk unemployment while waiting on Company_A (which ranks me last)."
