Success looks like shipping a meaningful deliverable and showing clear impact (e.g., cycle-time reduction, quality/reliability lift, revenue/cost impact, or a measurable user/customer KPI).\n- Build strong cross-functional operating rhythm (clear updates, risk management, stakeholder alignment). Success looks like predictable delivery and partners describing you as “easy to work with” and proactive.\n- Improve/standardize a process or system as you learn the org. Success looks like a repeatable playbook or mechanism that the team continues using.\n\n2) Profile that tends to do best here\nPeople who ramp quickly in ambiguity, communicate crisply (especially async/written), and demonstrate strong ownership.
