Company_B ranks me 4th, which is also weak, but since it’s still unmatched, there may be a realistic chance if higher-priority seekers are already matched elsewhere. I should keep optionality: continue TALK with Company_B to preserve the possibility, while avoiding an APPLY that could lock me into my worst option before I’ve exhausted the chance at Company_C."

If you want, tell me which of the two deliverables above you’d be most excited to own and what metric you’d aim to move in the first 90 days.",
