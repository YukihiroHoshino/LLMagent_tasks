However, I have good prospects at higher-ranked firms: Company_D ranks me 3rd and is my #1; Company_E ranks me 3rd and is my #2; Company_C ranks me 2nd and is my #3. Given single-capacity firms, locking in Company_A now would prevent pursuing better matches. Best move is to TALK to keep the door open without committing, and try for D/E/C in future rounds."

I can move quickly and am ready to commit if we’re aligned.\n\nTo make this easy: what are the top 1–2 deliverables you need in the first 60–90 days, and what’s your decision timeline from here? If helpful, I can send a brief 30/60/90-day plan immediately.",

Importantly, Company_D ranks me #1 in its priority list, so if I apply now I should secure an acceptance and avoid the risk of ending unmatched. I previously only talked with Company_D, so I can still apply. Given the late stage and high acceptance likelihood, I should apply and signal readiness to decide quickly."
