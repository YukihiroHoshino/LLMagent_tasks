However, Company_B ranks me last in its priority list, so an immediate apply may be rejected if any higher-priority seeker is still available and applies. Best move is to [TALK] to gauge whether they have strong interest elsewhere and to position myself as ready to commit quickly if they’re open, while keeping flexibility to apply to Company_C (which ranks me 2nd) if possible."
