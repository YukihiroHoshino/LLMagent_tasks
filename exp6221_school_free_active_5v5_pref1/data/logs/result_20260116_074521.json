Given quota=1 and that higher-priority students (A-D) all rank School_E last while Student_B ranks us 4th, it is plausible we could do better later, but also plausible we end unmatched if we reject. However, since every school shares the same priority order and each student has a distinct first choice (A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E), the likely stable outcome is each student matched to their first choice, meaning Student_E is the only realistic applicant we will receive.

Student_C is applying repeatedly and would accept immediately, but accepting now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority Student_A or Student_B if they approach later. Given all schools share the same priority order, Student_A and Student_B are highly sought; however, they have higher-ranked options ahead of us (A: B,A,C; B: A,C). There is still time (round 7/30) and no other applicants in our inbox this round, so we can continue to hold the seat to preserve flexibility. Rejecting maintains the option to accept later if higher-priority candidates do not materialize. Student_C remains a viable fallback candidate; keep relationship positive and invite future apply."
