Given we have quota 1 and only Student_C has applied this round, we must weigh holding out for higher-priority students vs securing a committed first-choice applicant now. Student_A prefers School_B then School_A then School_C; Student_B prefers School_A then School_C; both may not apply to School_C in round 1 and could be captured by School_A/School_B quickly. Accepting Student_C now ensures we fill the seat with a student on our list and avoid ending unmatched; the opportunity cost of waiting is high because higher-ranked students have stronger alternatives and may never reach us.

No higher-priority students have applied to School_D yet, but they may do so later if rejected elsewhere (School_D is 4th for A/C and last for B; D already applied and was rejected earlier). With rounds remaining, holding the seat preserves the chance to match with a higher-priority student. Accepting E now would forgo that upside.

With a hard round limit (30) and risk of ending unmatched (worse than taking E, who is still on our acceptable list), it is now optimal to fill the seat with Student_E rather than continue waiting indefinitely for higher-priority applicants who have shown no interest in School_D (A/B/C rank D 4th/5th; D already applied and was rejected).
