On my true priority list, Student_A is ranked above Student_B, but Student_A’s first choice is School_B (and School_B also ranks Student_A first), so Student_A is unlikely to apply to me early or end up available. Student_B ranks School_A as their first choice and is applying now; accepting secures a high-priority student (2nd on my list) rather than risking an unfilled seat waiting for Student_A. No other applicants are in my inbox this round, so accepting is optimal."

              "thought": "Apply immediately to my top choice, School_D. All schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), so I am only 4th in priority everywhere.

My true priority ranks Student_D 4th (A, B, C ahead), so ideally I would like to hold the seat for a higher-ranked student if I expect them to apply later. However, School_D is ranked 4th or 5th by Students A/B/C, and each of those students has higher-preferred options (and other schools share the same priority ordering, meaning they will likely be accepted elsewhere). The only student who has School_D as first choice is Student_D, making it unlikely that higher-ranked students will come to me soon. With quota 1, accepting Student_D now secures a match rather than risking an unfilled seat."

Our top priorities (Student_A, Student_B, Student_C, Student_D) all rank School_E as their last choice, so they are unlikely to apply here unless rejected elsewhere. Given we only have one quota, accepting Student_E now secures a match with a student who truly prefers us first, with low risk of losing a higher-priority candidate who is unlikely to come.

Given Student_C ranks School_C as first choice, accepting now secures a match but risks missing higher-priority Student_A/Student_B if they later apply. However, with quota 1 and no other applicants this round, and given the market where Student_A prefers School_B/School_A over School_C and Student_B prefers School_A first (so they may never apply to me), the risk of waiting may leave my seat unfilled. Accepting Student_C is a safe, preference-aligned outcome with a student who is committed to us."
