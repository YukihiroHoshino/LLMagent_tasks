Waiting in hopes of Student_A is risky because Student_A’s first choice is School_B and may never apply to School_A. Given the market information and the desire to fill the seat with a high-priority student, accepting Student_B (ranked 2nd) is optimal now."

With identical priority lists across schools (A highest to E lowest), I am last priority everywhere, so waiting or talking first only increases the chance the seat is taken by higher-priority students.

Although Student_E is applying now and would fill our single seat immediately, we can likely do better by waiting: Student_A/B/C/D all rank School_E last, but they will be rejected by their higher choices first and may apply later. Since we prefer a higher-ranked student and have no cost to waiting in round 1 (quota still open), reject Student_E to preserve the seat for a higher-priority candidate who may come later."

Given we cannot proactively solicit others and there is no guarantee higher-priority students (A/B/C) will apply to School_D (they each rank other schools above us), holding out risks ending unmatched. With only one current applicant, accepting Student_D is the safest way to fill the seat with an acceptable student on our list."

If School_E is truly your first choice and you are ready to commit, you may submit an [APPLY] again in an upcoming round; we will review based on capacity and our priority order at that time.\n\nIf you’d like, please reply with 2–3 bullet points on your most relevant academic/activities highlights and what you hope to pursue at School_E.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions",

Our quota is 1, and higher-priority students (A–D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to approach us unless rejected elsewhere. Since Student_E is only TALKing (not applying) and we can still keep capacity open, the best strategy is to keep them engaged without committing, while encouraging a prompt APPLY later if they remain interested."
