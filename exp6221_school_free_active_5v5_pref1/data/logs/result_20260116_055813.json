With only one current applicant and a quota of 1, accepting Student_E now secures a match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if no higher-priority student ever applies. Since all students are on our acceptable list, accepting is consistent with preferences, and the market structure suggests waiting is unlikely to yield a better candidate for School_E."

That said, we do reassess as the process progresses.\n\nWhile I can’t make a binding/conditional commitment, I can share an approximate planning point: if we reach around round 10 without receiving an application we can accept from a higher-priority candidate (or if it becomes clear they are no longer available because they have matched elsewhere), we would be much more likely to reopen consideration for you promptly.\n\nIf you remain unmatched at that point, please message us again and submit an [APPLY] in that round so we can reassess immediately based on then-current availability.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions Committee\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Student_C is #3 on our true priority list, but we still have quota 1 and no match yet. Higher-priority Student_A (#1) and Student_B (#2) could still plausibly apply later: Student_A ranks School_C 3rd and Student_B ranks School_C 2nd, so both have credible paths to us if they are rejected by their top choices. Accepting Student_C now would foreclose the chance to match with A or B, which would be worse for School_C given our objective. Student_C sent [TALK], so we should provide a clearer (but non-binding) policy signal: we will continue holding through a later round threshold and then reconsider if no higher-priority applicants remain available. We cannot commit to a binding conditional offer, but we can give an approximate reassessment round to maintain engagement."

Student_A ranks School_C 3rd (behind B and A) and Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (behind A), so either could plausibly come to me if rejected elsewhere. No other students contacted me this round, and Student_C only sent [TALK], so I can continue to hold the seat without risk.
