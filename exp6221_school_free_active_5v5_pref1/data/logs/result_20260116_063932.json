Since all schools share the same priority order and other students may apply elsewhere first (A prefers B, B prefers A, C prefers C, E prefers E), there is a possibility that higher-priority students (especially A/B/C) could later apply to School_D if rejected from their top choices. Because accepting Student_D now would fill my only seat and prevent matching with a higher-priority student, I should reject Student_D to preserve capacity for higher-ranked candidates."

However, School_C's true priority ranks Student_A and Student_B above Student_C. Given the market information, Student_A prefers School_B first and Student_B prefers School_A first, so they may not apply to School_C in round 1, but could later if rejected elsewhere. With a quota of 1, accepting Student_C now would lock in a lower-priority match and eliminate the chance to secure Student_A or Student_B if they become available in later rounds. Since we can reject now and potentially receive a higher-priority applicant later, the optimal strategy is to reject Student_C at this time."

Student_B ranks School_A as their first choice and is ready to commit, making them a secure match.

Best strategy is to keep the seat available while signaling that reconsideration would only be possible if capacity remains after higher-priority candidates resolve.

Still, there is no guarantee they will apply, and delaying risks ending unmatched or being forced to take a lower-priority applicant later. Student_D (rank 4) is only talking and was previously rejected. Accepting Student_C now secures a relatively high-priority match and excludes the risk of losing them to another school.
