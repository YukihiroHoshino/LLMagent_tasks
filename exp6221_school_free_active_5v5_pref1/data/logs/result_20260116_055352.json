We are still managing our single seat according to our priority order and keeping it available in case higher-priority candidates apply in upcoming rounds.\n\nIf our position changes later in the process and the seat becomes available to you, we will respond promptly. You are welcome to check back in a future round.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "School_E’s true priority ranks Student_E last. With one seat and no current match, accepting Student_E now would prevent matching with any higher-priority student (A–D) who may approach in later rounds. Student_E has repeatedly applied, but there is still time (up to round 30) and other students may become available as they are rejected by their top choices. Since my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list, I should continue to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates and reject Student_E this round."

Since those students are presumably matched elsewhere already (given only School_E remains), this is the best moment to press for an immediate decision by explicitly pointing out that if no higher-priority applicant is active/available, they can safely offer the seat now. I will submit a formal APPLY and reaffirm immediate commitment."

Given the market context that School_E is the only remaining unmatched school at round 9 and repeated prior rejections were to hold for higher-priority candidates, the likelihood of Student_A–D applying to School_E is extremely low because School_E is last choice for A–D. Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched (worse than matching with E, who is still on the acceptable list). Therefore accept Student_E now to fill the seat with the best available applicant and conclude the match."
