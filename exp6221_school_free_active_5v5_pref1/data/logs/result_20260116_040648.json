However, in this round only Student_D applied to me, and Student_D lists School_D as first choice, so accepting would lock in a sure match. If I reject to hold out for higher-ranked students (A/B/C), they currently prefer other schools over School_D and are unlikely to apply here early; waiting risks ending unmatched. With no competing applicants now and high commitment from Student_D, accepting maximizes certainty of filling my seat given market preferences."
