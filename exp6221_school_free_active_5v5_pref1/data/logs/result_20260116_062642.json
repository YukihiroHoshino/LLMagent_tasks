With one seat, accepting Student_C now risks losing the chance to match with a higher-priority student if they apply later. Student_C is persistent and would accept immediately, but that does not outweigh the priority ordering given the remaining rounds and the possibility that Student_A (who ranks School_C 3rd) or Student_B (who ranks School_C 2nd) may turn to School_C if rejected by their top choices. Since quota remains 1 and no higher-priority applicants are in the current inbox, the optimal strategy to maximize priority is to continue holding the seat and reject for now."

With many rounds remaining (up to 30) and no pressure to fill immediately, the optimal strategy to maximize outcome on the true priority list is to continue holding the seat and reject Student_C for now while inviting them to reapply later."

Given students’ preferences: Student_A ranks School_C 3rd and likely pursues School_B then School_A; Student_B ranks School_C 2nd and likely pursues School_A first. It’s plausible they could still come later if rejected elsewhere, but continued holding risks ending unmatched by round 30. Student_C has repeatedly demonstrated immediate-accept commitment and School_C is their first choice, making the match very secure. To maximize expected outcome (avoid empty seat) while still aiming high, it is now optimal to accept Student_C rather than continue waiting indefinitely for A/B who have not shown interest so far."
