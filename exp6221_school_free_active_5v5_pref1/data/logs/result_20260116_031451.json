Given the market info, Student_E ranks School_E first and will accept immediately, but higher-priority students (A–D) all rank School_E last, meaning they are unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else. However, with rounds remaining (current round 27/30), there is still a possibility that one of A–D becomes unmatched and applies to School_E late. Accepting Student_E now would lock my only seat and prevent matching with any higher-priority student if they appear. Since my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list, I should continue holding the seat and reject Student_E this round, consistent with prior messages and strategy."
