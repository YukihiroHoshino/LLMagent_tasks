If that happens and our seat is still open, you would become the next candidate we could seriously consider.\n\n2) **Late-stage cutoff if they remain inactive:** if we reach a **later point in the process** with **no applications from Student_A/Student_B/Student_C** and no indication they are likely to apply, we will prioritize filling the seat rather than leaving it empty. As a practical guideline, we would begin treating this as likely around **Round 20+** if our seat is still unfilled and those higher-priority candidates have not engaged with us.\n\nUntil one of those conditions occurs, with one seat and our priority order, we need to keep the spot available in case a higher-priority student applies.\n\nIf you’d like, you can continue to check in each round; if/when we hit condition (1) or (2), we will tell you explicitly to submit an [APPLY] that round so we can act immediately.\n\n[TALK]",

Student_D sent [TALK], so we should respond with [TALK] and provide a concrete policy/timeline without committing. Best strategy: continue holding seat; specify that we would switch to Student_D only once A/B/C are confirmed matched elsewhere or late-stage threshold (e.g., after a certain round without any application) to reduce risk of ending unmatched.
