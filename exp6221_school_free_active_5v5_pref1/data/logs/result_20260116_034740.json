Given full information, Student_A prefers B then A then C; Student_B prefers A then C; likely they will apply to their top choices first and may come to us later.

Student_E (lowest priority) already applied earlier and was rejected to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates. In the full market, Student_A/B/C/D all rank School_E last, so it is unlikely that a higher-priority student (A or B) will apply to School_E unless they are rejected everywhere else, which may take many rounds and risks leaving my seat unfilled.

Given the market, Student_A prefers B then A then C; Student_B prefers A then C; Student_C prefers C first (but we rejected earlier); Student_D prefers D then A then C; Student_E prefers E then B then A then C. Higher-priority students may still become available if rejected elsewhere, so it remains optimal to keep the seat open until the late rounds as previously communicated, while maintaining E’s engagement for a fallback around round 20."
