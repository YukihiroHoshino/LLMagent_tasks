Student_D is relatively low on my list, and importantly School_E is Student_D’s last choice, so even if I accept, there is risk they may later pursue/accept School_D or School_A if available, reducing match stability. In prior rounds I already rejected Student_D, signaling low priority.

I still have 1 seat, but accepting Student_E now would block the possibility of matching with any higher-priority student if they engage later. History shows Student_E repeatedly applies and is willing to enroll, but that does not change my priority ordering. There is no new information confirming higher-priority students are out of play, and my stated policy has been to hold the seat as long as that possibility remains, even if it ultimately goes unfilled. Therefore I should reject Student_E again this round to preserve the option for higher-priority applicants."

The strategic choice is whether to keep the seat open for higher-priority students A–D. Given all schools share identical priorities (A highest), A–D are very likely to be absorbed by their higher-preferred schools and have shown no engagement with School_E; however, there remains some chance a higher-priority student could apply to us later if rejected elsewhere. Past rounds we repeatedly rejected Student_E to preserve optionality, but with round 25/30 approaching, the value of waiting is declining. Accepting Student_E now guarantees filling the seat with an acceptable student; waiting risks ending unmatched if no one else applies, and we have no evidence A–D will come. Since our objective is to match with the highest possible on our list within quota, but also to avoid leaving the seat empty when higher-priority candidates are unlikely to appear, at round 25 it is reasonable to accept Student_E to secure a match rather than gamble for a late higher-priority applicant."
