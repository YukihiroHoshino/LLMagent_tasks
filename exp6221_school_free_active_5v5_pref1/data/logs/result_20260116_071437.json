While Student_A is our top choice, there is no message/application from Student_A this round, and delaying risks ending unmatched or losing Student_B to another school later.

With identical priority rankings across schools (A highest to E lowest), I have the weakest priority everywhere, so waiting or talking risks losing my top option without improving my standing. A direct application maximizes my chance to secure my #1 before seats fill."

Given all schools share the same priority ordering and most students rank School_E last except Student_E, higher-priority students (A-D) are unlikely to apply to School_E early; still, there is a chance that some higher-priority student fails to get their top choices and later applies to School_E. With quota 1, accepting now risks missing a better-ranked student later, but rejecting risks ending unmatched if no one else applies. Considering Student_E’s strong commitment and the low likelihood of others choosing School_E, it is safer to accept to ensure a match."

All schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), so I’m not highly prioritized, but applying to my first choice in round 1 is still optimal since delaying only increases the chance the seat is taken by higher-priority students.

Since other students’ first choices are School_B (A), School_A (B), School_C (C), and School_E (E), they are unlikely to apply to School_D in round 1; they might come later if rejected elsewhere.
