Over the past year I’ve consistently been at the top of my class in algebra/geometry and I’ve taken on extra challenge sets independently (I keep a notebook of solved problems and reflections on mistakes to improve).\n\n2) Meaningful activity/impact: I helped run a peer tutoring routine for younger students (weekly, small group). I focused on building their confidence and study habits, and we tracked progress with short quizzes—several students improved their term grades noticeably. I also take initiative in group projects by organizing tasks and timelines so the team delivers on time.\n\n3) What I want to contribute at School_E: I want to contribute as a dependable academic peer—supporting a tutoring/mentoring culture—and also join (or help start) a problem-solving/stem club that does regular practice sessions and friendly competitions. I’m especially motivated to contribute to a community where students push each other constructively.\n\nSchool_E remains my first choice, and if admitted I would accept immediately.
