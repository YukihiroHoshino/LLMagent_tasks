With quota 1, accepting now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_A/B/C if they later apply. Given full information: Student_A ranks School_D 4th, Student_B ranks School_D 5th, Student_C ranks School_D 4th, Student_E ranks School_D 5th—so higher-priority students are unlikely to target me early, but they could become unmatched later and apply. Still, immediate acceptance is not required; I can reject now to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates. There is no mechanism to hold/waitlist; only accept or reject on APPLY. Therefore, reject to keep option value for A/B/C."

Our priorities are identical across schools, so top students may be competed over, but holding for at least a bit longer can improve our outcome. Therefore, reject Student_D again this round."
