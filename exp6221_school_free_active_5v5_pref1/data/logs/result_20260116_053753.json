Given all schools share the same priority order (A>B>C>D>E) and students’ preferences place School_E last for A-D, it is likely A-D will be accepted by their earlier choices and never reach School_E. However, to maximize the chance of matching with a higher-priority student, it is optimal to reject Student_E now and wait at least a few rounds; accepting Student_E immediately forecloses any chance to take A-D if they do apply later. Since leaving the seat unfilled is preferred over taking someone not on the list (and Student_E is on the list), waiting is the key tradeoff. With 30 rounds available, rejecting now preserves optionality."

If we reject to wait for A/B/C, we risk ending unmatched because A prefers B>A>C>D>E; B prefers A>C>B>E>D; C prefers C>B>A>D>E, so none of A/B/C are likely to apply to us early (or at all).

Our objective is to match as high as possible on the true priority list, and leaving the seat unfilled is preferred to taking someone outside the top of the list (E is in the list but lowest), so we should continue to hold for higher-priority candidates.

We can’t credibly promise a specific round threshold because it would constrain our ability to take a higher-priority applicant later; the safest strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue holding the seat and reiterate that we will only move to lower-priority candidates when it becomes clear no higher-priority applicants are coming (i.e., near the end or after observing continued non-arrival)."
