However, Student_D ranks School_D as their first choice, making acceptance likely to finalize a stable match immediately. Given the round is 1 and no higher-priority students have contacted me yet, I could wait to try for A/B/C, but they all rank other schools above School_D and may never apply. Accepting Student_D secures a match rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-priority student later. Therefore, accept."

While Student_A is ranked higher, Student_A’s first choice is School_B, so there is a meaningful risk they do not apply to School_A soon (or at all).

Given the market preferences, higher-priority students (A-D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply to me unless rejected everywhere else, which may not happen within the limited rounds. To avoid ending unmatched, accepting Student_E now secures a filled seat with a committed student who states they will enroll if admitted."
