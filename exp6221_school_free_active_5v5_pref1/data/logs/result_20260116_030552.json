However, on School_E’s true priority list, Student_E is ranked last (A > B > C > D > E). Given the market preferences, Student_A ranks School_E last and is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_E 4th; Student_C ranks School_E last; Student_D ranks School_E last. Therefore, the probability that a higher-priority student (A–D) will apply to School_E in later rounds is low. With quota 1, accepting Student_E now secures a match and avoids ending unmatched while waiting for unlikely higher-priority applicants."

Student_A prefers School_B and School_A above School_C, and Student_B prefers School_A first; both may never apply to School_C. With quota 1, rejecting Student_C risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower-priority student later, while accepting secures a solid, willing match now."

Student_D lists School_D as first choice and is ready to commit, so accepting secures a match immediately. Waiting could allow higher-priority students (A/B/C) to apply later, but given their preferences (A prefers B>A>C>D; B prefers A>C>B>E>D; C prefers C>B>A>D), School_D is not their top choice and they may never reach me. With no competing applicants now and a credible commitment from Student_D, accepting maximizes certainty of filling my seat with an in-list student rather than risking ending unmatched."
