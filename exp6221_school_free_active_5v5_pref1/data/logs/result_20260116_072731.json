With quota 1, accepting Student_E now sacrifices the chance—however small—of later matching with a higher-priority student. Given the market (each school’s priority identical and each student has a distinct first choice), A-D are likely to be accepted by their first choices, meaning they may never apply to School_E.

With no confirmed info that A/B are matched and out, accepting C now risks losing a higher-priority match. Even though it’s round 9 and Student_C claims School_C may be the only unmatched school, we cannot verify A/B are out of play; our optimal strategy to maximize priority is to continue holding the seat for A/B until we have confirmation or it becomes very late. Therefore reject this round while signaling we will accept promptly once A/B are confirmed matched elsewhere or near the end."

It is plausible both are already matched to higher choices; also the prompt indicates School_C is the only unmatched school, implying other schools filled seats and A/B likely matched. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched by round 30 with no benefit if A/B never apply. Accepting C now secures a match with an eligible student (in our list) albeit lower than A/B, but best available with high confidence A/B out of play. Therefore accept Student_C."
