A formal application in round 25 is unlikely to be accepted because School_C explicitly asked me to apply again at round 26 if still unmatched. Therefore, I will send a brief [TALK] message to confirm nothing has changed and signal I will submit an immediate [APPLY] at round 26 if they are still holding the seat, keeping me positioned to secure the only remaining match opportunity."

Even so, we are still holding our single seat through round 25 because a higher-priority candidate could still apply in the remaining round if their other options fall through.\n\nAs shared previously, please check in again in **round 26** and submit a formal **[APPLY]** at that time if you remain interested. In round 26 we will do our final reassessment based on whether any higher-priority candidates have engaged, and we will make a decision then.\n\n[TALK]",

No higher-priority students have contacted us, but with one round remaining after this (round 26), a higher-priority student (A–D) could still apply if displaced elsewhere. Student_E is only [TALK] this round, so no accept/reject decision required now. Best strategy to maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority student is to continue holding through round 25 and invite Student_E to apply in round 26 as previously indicated, while making clear we still cannot promise acceptance until then."
