However, in round 1 the only applicant is Student_B, who also ranks School_A as first choice, making acceptance likely to secure a match immediately. Waiting could allow Student_A to apply later, but Student_A’s first choice is School_B, so there is significant risk that Student_A matches elsewhere and never applies to School_A. Given quota=1 and the goal to match as high as possible within realistic market dynamics, accepting Student_B now dominates the uncertain option of holding out for Student_A."
