Given the market info: Student_A ranks School_D 4th; Student_B ranks School_D last; Student_C ranks School_D 4th; Student_E ranks School_D last; Student_D ranks School_D 1st. This makes it unlikely that higher-priority students (A/B/C) will apply to me early or at all, while Student_D is the most committed and most likely to match with me. To secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched, accepting Student_D in round 1 is a strong move."

Given all schools share the same priority ordering (A > B > C > D > E) and each student’s first choice is their same-letter school, it is unlikely that Students A-D will apply to School_E in early rounds; they will pursue their top choices first. However, rejections or competition could redirect them. With only one seat, accepting Student_E now guarantees filling the seat but risks missing a higher-priority student later. Still, since Student_E has School_E as first choice and is applying immediately, and there is no evidence of imminent higher-priority applicants in this round’s inbox, accepting is reasonable to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."
