However, we should consider waiting for higher-priority students (A/B/C). From preferences: A ranks School_E last; B ranks School_E 4th; C ranks School_E last; D ranks School_E last; E ranks School_E 1st. This implies A and C are very unlikely to apply; B could apply later if rejected elsewhere; D is also unlikely to have many better options but currently is applying, which is an opportunity.
