However, to maximize my chance at a higher-priority student, I should not commit in round 1; I can reject now and hope a higher-ranked student becomes unmatched and applies later. Risk: I may end up unfilled if Student_E matches elsewhere, but Student_E’s first choice is me, so they may re-apply if rejected. I will reject to preserve optionality for higher-ranked students."

Student_E strongly prefers me and is applying again, but accepting now would lock my only seat with my lowest-priority candidate. Given the market, higher-priority students (A–D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply early; however, it is still possible that one of them becomes unmatched later and applies to School_E as a fallback. Since I prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside my list (and Student_E is on my list but lowest), the key question is whether waiting could yield a higher-priority student. With 28 rounds remaining, it is strategically better to keep the seat open and reject now, preserving the option to accept a higher-priority applicant later if they appear. Student_E can continue pursuing other schools where they have higher chances, and I can reconsider only if the market evolves and no higher-priority candidates emerge near the end."
