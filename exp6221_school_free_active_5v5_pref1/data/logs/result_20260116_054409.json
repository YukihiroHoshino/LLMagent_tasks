Student_C lists School_C as their first choice and is offering a strong commitment, making acceptance now a high-probability way to fill our seat with a reasonably high-priority student rather than risking ending up with a lower-ranked student or an unfilled seat."

              "thought": "Student_E is the only applicant in the inbox this round, but School_D’s true priority ranks Student_E last (A > B > C > D > E). With quota 1, accepting E now would block the possibility of matching with any higher-priority student if they later apply to School_D (e.g., if they are rejected elsewhere). Given the history, Student_E is persistent but still lowest priority; rejecting keeps the seat available for higher-ranked candidates. No evidence suggests higher-priority students are already matched to their top choices permanently, so preserving flexibility is optimal for School_D’s objective."

Overall, my coursework has been consistently rigorous, and I’m happy to highlight any recent improvements or strongest subjects.\n\n2) Attendance/discipline: No disciplinary issues. Attendance has been strong; if you need exact counts/dates I can provide them.\n\n3) Key activities/leadership (top 2–3):\n- I can summarize my main commitments and leadership roles succinctly—please let me know if you prefer bullet points with hours/week and measurable impact.\n\n4) Fit statement (3–5 sentences): School_D appeals to me because I’m looking for a structured, academically focused environment where I can contribute consistently in class and through activities. I’m especially motivated by settings that value steady effort, clear expectations, and community responsibility. If admitted, I would bring reliability, strong work habits, and a willingness to take on roles where I can support peers and improve programs over time. I’m eager to commit and invest in School_D’s community long-term.\n\n5) Ranking/commitment: Yes—School_D is my top remaining choice among schools still available, and if offered admission I will accept immediately and withdraw from any other active options.\n\nIf you tell me the exact academic/activities format you prefer, I will send the full details in that format right away.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",
