Student_D is applying now and lists School_D as first choice, so accepting would lock in a lower-priority student and prevent matching with higher-priority candidates if they apply later. However, given the market, Student_A prefers B/A/C over D; Student_B prefers A/C/B/E over D; Student_C prefers C/B/A over D; Student_E prefers E/B/A/C over D. So none of A/B/C/E are likely to apply to School_D early (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Still, it is possible they end up applying later, but the probability appears low. Since Student_D is a sure match to us now and is on our acceptable list, accepting secures filling our seat rather than risking ending unmatched by waiting."
