Student_B ranks School_A first and will immediately accept, giving a secure match with a high-ranked student (2nd on my list). Accepting now maximizes expected outcome under uncertainty."

Given full information: Student_A-D all rank School_E last, while Student_E ranks School_E first and is applying now. With quota 1 and no other applicants in inbox, rejecting risks ending unmatched because higher-priority students are unlikely to ever apply.

However, in round 1 the only applicant to School_C is Student_C, who also ranks School_C as their first choice, making acceptance likely to secure a committed match. If I reject now hoping for Student_A or Student_B, they are more likely to apply to School_B/School_A first (both ranked above School_C for them), so there is meaningful risk I end up with a lower-priority student or an unfilled seat. With quota 1 and a strong, immediate first-choice applicant, accepting Student_C is the safest way to achieve a high-priority match given current information."

Currently only Student_D applied to us, but higher-priority students may apply later; however, Student_A/B/C all rank School_D low (4th/5th), while Student_C ranks us 4th. Student_D ranks us 1st and has applied now. Accepting secures a match but risks missing a higher-priority student; given others’ preferences, the probability of receiving an application from A/B/C is low. Therefore accept Student_D now to fill quota with a willing applicant."
