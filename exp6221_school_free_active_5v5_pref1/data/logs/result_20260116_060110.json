Student_E is persistently applying and would commit immediately, but accepting now would forfeit any chance to match with a higher-priority student if they approach in later rounds. Given the market info, Student_A/B/C/D all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply unless they exhaust other options; however, with many rounds remaining (current round 17 of 30), there is still meaningful upside to waiting for a higher-priority student to become available. Since I strictly prefer a higher-priority student and can leave the seat unfilled rather than accept someone lower, the optimal move is to continue rejecting Student_E while holding the seat."

Our seat is currently unclaimed; however, we are still **holding it as a precaution** for higher-priority candidates, since the process is dynamic and students’ situations can change from round to round.\n\nBecause of that, we can’t offer a defined point at which we will certainly move to next-in-line candidates. If circumstances change such that we are able to consider applicants at your priority level, we will do so at that time.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and no match yet. Our true priority list ranks Student_E last, so we should only accept E if we believe higher-priority students (A–D) will not apply to us. Given all schools share identical priorities and Student_A–D all rank School_E last in their preferences, they are extremely unlikely to approach us unless rejected everywhere else. However, the market still has rounds remaining, and holding the seat preserves the chance—however small—of matching with A–D if they become unmatched late. Student_E is only TALKing, so we should respond with TALK, be transparent that we have not received applications from higher-priority candidates this round (as far as our inbox shows), but that we are still holding the seat and cannot commit to a timeline. This keeps our option value while maintaining dialogue."

No higher-priority candidates have contacted us recently, and continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched by round 30, which is worse than filling it with our lowest-priority acceptable student (Student_E is still on our true priority list). Student_E ranks us first and will commit immediately, guaranteeing a match now.
