Company_D’s top priority is Seeker_B, so Seeker_B may be pulled away if not accepted now, but Company_E prefers to hold the slot for higher-ranked seekers who might come in later rounds. Since rounds remain and quota is 1, rejecting now preserves flexibility to pursue Seeker_A/Seeker_D/Seeker_E if they become available; risk is ending unmatched, but Seeker_E is a realistic future applicant.

Mapped current state, defined success metrics, built a phased plan, ran weekly stakeholder syncs, and shipped a new process + lightweight tooling. Result: faster cycle time and clearer ownership; sustained via documented SOPs and weekly reporting.\n• Example 2 (Go-to-market/Implementation): Coordinated a customer-facing rollout across Product, Eng, Legal, and CS.

Only Seeker_C is engaging us; they are last on our list and we have repeatedly rejected their APPLY attempts to preserve optionality for higher-priority seekers. In this round Seeker_C sent [TALK] with strong, aligned operational artifacts. No higher-priority candidates have re-engaged so far, but accepting now would violate our stated approach and could block a better match if D/E/A/B appear in the next rounds. Since it’s a TALK message, we should continue dialogue, keep the tentative call, and set a clear decision rule/timeline: if no higher-priority candidate applies by a cutoff (e.g., morning of call), we will convert to acceptance path after the call. This maintains credibility and maximizes chance of a higher-priority match while keeping Seeker_C warm as fallback."

At round 27, no higher-priority candidates have re-engaged with us, and delaying further risks ending unmatched. Seeker_C is least-preferred but still on our list, and they are highly committed and ready to start immediately. Since they are only TALKing this round, we should continue TALK, reaffirm cutoff/call plan, and indicate that if no higher-priority candidate applies by cutoff we intend to proceed to an offer path immediately after the call, without yet accepting (no APPLY)."

With round 28 approaching the end (30), the risk of leaving the position unfilled is rising. Since Seeker_C is on our priority list (albeit last), and has demonstrated strong fit, responsiveness, and immediate availability, the best path is to keep TALK for one more round while honoring the stated cutoff, but be prepared to accept if no higher-priority candidate applies by cutoff to avoid an unfilled role. In this round Seeker_C is TALK, so respond with TALK, reaffirm process, and commit to a definitive go/no-go message after cutoff."
