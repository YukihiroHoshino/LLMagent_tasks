I led the end-to-end triage → root-cause analysis → fix/rollout loop, set the decision criteria for tradeoffs (speed vs. risk), and instituted guardrails (checks, alerts, rollback playbooks).\n• Decisions I owned: prioritization of fixes vs. mitigations, go/no-go for releases, and defining the operating thresholds/SLAs.\n• Metrics moved: reduced incident volume ~30% over a quarter; cut mean time to resolution ~20–25%; improved on-time delivery from ~70% to ~90% via tighter instrumentation + ownership clarity.\n\n2) Prior exposure that supports “day-1” judgment (systems/constraints/customer surface area):\n• Worked repeatedly in environments with real constraints (tight SLAs, cross-functional dependencies, and risk/quality tradeoffs).
