Best strategy is to reject now to preserve optionality; however, rejecting risks losing Seeker_B, but Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_E so they may re-engage later.

              "message": "[TALK] Hi Company_C—Seeker_C here. Since this is the final round, I’ll keep it to one question: have your higher-priority candidates now declined such that you’re reopening the slate and able to consider a fast fallback?\n\nIf yes, I’m available immediately and can do a same-day 15-minute screen (and provide the 1-page execution plan/decision memo outline right after, if requested). If not, I’ll step back fully. Thank you.",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched in the market, and it is #2 on my true preference list (acceptable). I have already been rejected multiple times and they explicitly asked me to stop follow-ups unless they reopen. Since this is the final round, an [APPLY] is unlikely to succeed and could be counterproductive; a concise [TALK] that offers immediate availability and asks whether they are now reopening is the best remaining move while respecting their process."

No, our higher-priority conversations have not declined in a way that would cause us to reopen the slate, and we’re not able to activate a fallback process at this time. Given it’s the final round, we won’t be moving forward with additional steps. Thank you again for your persistence and professionalism, and I wish you the best in your search.",
              "thought": "We are Company_C with quota 1 and remain unmatched at round 30 (final). Our true priority list ranks Seeker_C last and we have repeatedly communicated we are not reopening the slate; we also previously rejected Seeker_C’s applications. With no ability to run further rounds and no [APPLY] from Seeker_C, we can only respond with [TALK]. Given our stated preferences (would rather leave unfilled than hire outside list—but Seeker_C is on the list, albeit lowest), accepting is not available without an [APPLY] and would be inconsistent with our repeated stance. Best action is to close the loop: confirm no change, we are not reopening, and we will not proceed this cycle."
