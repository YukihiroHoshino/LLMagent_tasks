I’m also comfortable flexing across scope (from hands-on delivery to process/design of the workstream).\n\n(2) Two end-to-end ownership examples:\n- Project 1 (end-to-end delivery): Owned a cross-functional launch from initial requirements through rollout. I aligned stakeholders on success metrics, built the execution plan, ran weekly delivery, unblocked dependencies (eng/ops), and drove the go-live + post-launch iteration. Outcome: shipped on schedule and improved the key operational KPI we targeted (cycle time/throughput).\n- Project 2 (ramp + ambiguity): Took over an under-scoped initiative with unclear ownership, clarified scope and milestones, set up a simple operating cadence (prioritization + tracking), and led delivery through completion. Outcome: reduced slippage, improved predictability, and created a repeatable process the team reused afterward.\n\n(3) Earliest start date: I can start immediately.\n\nIf helpful, I’m happy to tailor this to your highest-need area—could you share which team/problem space is most urgent right now so I can map my experience more directly?

Answers below:\n\n1) Tools/stack + most concrete automation\n- Tools I’ve used: Jira (workflows, automation rules), Asana, Google Sheets/Excel (advanced formulas + App Script), SQL (for pulling/validating operational data), Python (light ETL/automation), and BI (Looker/Tableau) for dashboards.\n- Most concrete automation: I set up an automated “delivery health” pipeline that pulled ticket/work-item data (status, age, blocked reason, owner) into a clean table (SQL), then generated a daily dashboard + alerts. Alerts flagged items stuck >X days, missing owners, or blocked dependencies, and posted a digest to the team channel plus created follow-up tasks automatically. This reduced manual chasing and made bottlenecks visible early.\n\n2) Launch example — team size + hardest dependencies\n- Team size: ~10–14 core contributors (6–8 eng, 2 ops, 1 data/analytics, 1 design, plus 2–3 stakeholders).\n- Hardest dependencies: (a) coordinating eng changes with ops readiness/training and cutover timing, (b) data instrumentation/definitions to ensure we measured the right cycle-time KPI, and (c) resolving ownership gaps when issues spanned systems (hand-offs between two eng teams + ops). I unblocked by creating a single dependency register with owners/dates, setting a twice-weekly exec cadence for escalations, and tightening acceptance criteria so ops sign-off was objective.\n\n3) First 30 days plan to reduce cycle time\n- Week 1: Listen + map the workflow end-to-end (intake → execution → handoff), confirm the cycle-time definition, and baseline current performance by segment (team, work type, step).\n- Week 2: Identify top 2–3 bottlenecks (e.g., queueing, rework, approvals, dependency waits). Implement a lightweight operating cadence: daily/biweekly triage, explicit WIP limits, and a standard “blocked” taxonomy.\n- Week 3: Stand up visibility + automation: dashboard for aging/WIP/blocked reasons; automated alerts for stuck work; a dependency board with owners and escalation SLAs.\n- Week 4: Pilot targeted changes on the highest-volume lane (e.g., clearer intake criteria, smaller batch sizing, faster dependency escalation). Measure before/after, lock in what works, and propose the next iteration.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re prioritizing, I’m happy to move to next steps and—if you’d like—re-submit a formal application under this scope immediately.
