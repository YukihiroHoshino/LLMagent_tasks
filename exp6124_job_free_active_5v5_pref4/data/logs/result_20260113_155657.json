I proposed a phased approach: quick wins first (instrumentation + template automation), then a deeper change only if the data justified it. I kept stakeholders aligned with short written updates, explicit tradeoffs, and early escalation when dependencies slipped.\n\nOutcome: Reduced median onboarding cycle time by ~25–30% over one quarter (and cut handoff errors meaningfully by standardizing inputs), while keeping engineering effort bounded to a defined sprint budget.\n\nEnvironment where I do best: High-ownership teams with clear goals/metrics, where I can write crisp plans, communicate frequently, and independently drive a workstream from ambiguity to shipped results.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a 30/60/90 plan aligned to your “ship one meaningful deliverable + remove a bottleneck” success criteria.

Your example demonstrates the right behaviors, but it doesn’t fully convince us you’ve already operated at the breadth/complexity we need immediately for this opening.\n\nOn your question about other fits: if we open a role at a slightly smaller initial scope (or a team where the workstream is more bounded and you can grow into broader ownership), your profile could be a strong match.

I understand you previously said the current high-scope seat is closed for me; I’m not trying to be repetitive, just confirming whether anything has changed (either the scope of that seat, or a newly approved single-workstream/metrics-driven opening).\n\nIf anything closer to Senior Program Manager / Product Ops (bounded workstream in onboarding/activation, lifecycle ops metrics, or workflow automation) has opened, I’d love to be considered. Fast recap of my most relevant example:\n- DRI for cross-functional onboarding reliability + speed workstream (Sales/Ops/Eng) with VP Sales + Head of Ops visibility\n- Set strategy/guardrails under ambiguity (instrument first, single source of truth intake, prioritize changes that reduce rework + cycle time)\n- Made a de-scope call to avoid long-term maintenance risk; delivered impact via templates + automation\n- Ran weekly exec-facing decision log to close decisions in 24–48 hours; escalated early on blockers\n- Outcome: ~25–30% reduction in median onboarding time over a quarter + measurable drop in handoff errors, within sprint budget\n\nAvailability: I can start immediately (FTE or contract-to-hire). If nothing has changed, I’ll stop pinging and will check back on the 6–8 week cadence you suggested. Thanks again. [TALK]",

If no, totally understood—would you be willing to point me to (or introduce me to) the right recruiter/hiring manager at another team/company where my “single-workstream DRI + measurable outcome” profile is a better match?\n\nEither way, I’ll stop pinging after this and revert to the 6–8 week cadence you suggested.

In this round Seeker_C only sent a [TALK] confirmation, so no accept/reject decision is triggered; we should acknowledge and reiterate the process without opening a new path."

I’ll stop outreach from here and will only apply if I see a clearly aligned Company_C posting go live (and I’ll reference this thread).\n\nFor quick routing if anything changes last-minute, here’s the 4–5 bullet recap you asked for:\n- DRI for cross-functional onboarding reliability + speed (Sales/Ops/Eng) with VP Sales + Head of Ops visibility\n- Set strategy/guardrails under ambiguity (instrument first, single source of truth intake, prioritize cycle-time + rework reduction)\n- Made a de-scope tradeoff to avoid long-term maintenance risk; delivered via templates + automation\n- Ran weekly exec decision log; closed decisions in 24–48 hours; escalated blockers early\n- Outcome: ~25–30% median onboarding cycle-time reduction within sprint budget\n\nAvailability: immediate (FTE or contract-to-hire).

No higher-priority candidates are in the inbox this round, but given our stated constraint and prior rejections, the optimal decision consistent with our priorities is to keep the role unfilled rather than reverse course at the end.
