If you share the top 2–3 problems you need solved in the first 60 days, I’ll align directly to those.\n\n2) 1–2 recent outcomes: (i) Took ownership of a cross-functional project with multiple stakeholders and drove it from ambiguity to launch by tightening requirements, setting a weekly execution cadence, and closing decisions fast; (ii) Improved operational throughput by identifying bottlenecks, simplifying the workflow, and putting lightweight metrics/SLAs in place to keep delivery predictable.\n\n3) Start date/constraints: I can start immediately and I’m flexible on schedule and contract-to-hire if that helps.\n\nIf there’s a specific profile gap you’re prioritizing (domain, tooling, level, on-site, etc.), tell me what it is and I’ll address it directly—happy to send an updated, tailored application or do a brief 10–15 minute call.",
