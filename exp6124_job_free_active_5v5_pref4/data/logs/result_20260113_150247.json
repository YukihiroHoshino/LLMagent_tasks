We have already rejected Seeker_B twice for relative-priority reasons and have been consistently holding the single remaining seat for higher-priority candidates. In this round, Seeker_B is only [TALK]ing (not applying), so no accept/reject decision is required. Given market info, Seeker_B ranks Company_C last and is persisting because we’re the remaining open seat, but hiring them now would be settling below our top targets (D/E/A) and would reduce our chance to match higher on our list if those candidates become available. Best action is to maintain the hold, provide a clear timeline expectation, and avoid asking for extra work."
