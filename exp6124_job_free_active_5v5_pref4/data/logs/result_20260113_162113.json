I set the milestones, built a lightweight RAID log, ran daily check-ins, and coordinated dependencies across Eng/Ops/Support. We shipped on time by narrowing scope to must-haves, sequencing work to unblock critical paths early, and creating a clear cutover + rollback plan.\n\n2) Handling cross-functional conflict/misalignment: In a prior program, Product wanted additional features while Eng flagged risk to timeline/quality. I facilitated a decision meeting with a single doc: goals, constraints, effort/risk by option, and customer impact. We aligned on an MVP for launch with a committed follow-on sprint, documented the tradeoffs, and set measurable acceptance criteria so everyone had the same definition of “done.”\n\n3) Scope/level I’m targeting: I’m targeting an execution-heavy role (program/project/ops-style) where I can own delivery end-to-end, drive cross-functional alignment, and be accountable for timelines/quality.
