Given other seekers’ preferences: Seeker_A ranks us 4th, Seeker_D ranks us 5th (unlikely), Seeker_E ranks us 2nd (promising). Company_D is the top choice for most seekers and will likely absorb strong candidates (especially Seeker_B, whom Company_D prioritizes #1 but Seeker_B prefers us). Still, with only round 1 and no other applicants yet, rejecting Seeker_B risks ending unmatched if higher-priority candidates never apply; however, Seeker_E is likely to apply to us if Company_D doesn’t work out, and Seeker_A could also come later. To preserve flexibility and because we must either accept or reject an [APPLY], we reject now to keep the slot for higher-priority candidates."

I defined the objective (increase activation) and mapped the funnel to identify the highest-leverage step.\n- Plan: Instrumented key events, ran stakeholder sessions (Product/Eng/Support) to align on hypotheses, and set a 2-week iteration plan with success metrics.\n- Execution: Delivered a revised onboarding flow + in-product guidance, added monitoring dashboards, and set up an experiment framework.\n- Result: Improved activation by ~18% and reduced time-to-first-value by ~25% over the next month.\n\n2) Cross-functional ambiguous delivery → reliable ship under uncertainty:\n- Problem framing: We needed a “single source of truth” status view for customers, but requirements were vague and teams disagreed on scope.\n- Plan: Wrote a one-page PRD with crisp scope, milestones, and risks; aligned Legal/Support/Engineering on what “done” meant; created a phased rollout.\n- Execution: Built the MVP, iterated based on feedback, and owned comms + launch readiness.\n- Result: Cut support tickets on “where is my request” by ~30% and improved internal SLA adherence via clearer ownership and visibility.\n\nIf helpful, I can provide deeper artifacts (PRD outline, experiment plan, dashboards) in a follow-up.
