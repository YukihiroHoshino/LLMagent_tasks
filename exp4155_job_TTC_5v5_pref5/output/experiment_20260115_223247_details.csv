Any deviation (e.g., applying to Company_C first) risks losing to Seeker_B at Company_C (who has higher priority there), and then in Step 2 Company_B would already be filled, costing me my best outcome. Therefore I submit my true order with Company_B first.",True,Company_B,False,False,1
100,Seeker_D,"['Company_B', 'Company_C', 'Company_A', 'Company_E', 'Company_D']","['Company_C', 'Company_B', 'Company_A', 'Company_E', 'Company_D']","Because admissions are final and companies disappear once filled, the key is to avoid wasting Step 1 on a company where I will certainly lose to a higher-priority applicant. If everyone applies truthfully in Step 1, Company_B will receive applications from Seeker_A, Seeker_C, and me; Company_B’s top priority among them is Seeker_C, so I would be rejected. Company_C will receive applications from Seeker_E (only), so it will remain available if I apply there in Step 1 and I am its highest-priority applicant among those who apply (I’m ranked above Seeker_E and Seeker_A). Thus, ranking Company_C first secures a permanent match at my #2 true choice, which is better than the likely outcome from starting at Company_B (where I’d be rejected and then face reduced options). The remaining order follows my true preferences among the remaining firms.",False,Company_D,False,False,5

If I apply to Company_C first, I will lose to Seeker_B (Company_C’s top priority) and be rejected; then in Step 2 I cannot apply to Company_D because it will already be filled in Step 1 by Seeker_D (its top priority). That would push me down to Company_A in Step 2, but Company_A will also already be filled in Step 1 by me only if I apply there first; otherwise it likely fills with Seeker_B in Step 1. Therefore, to avoid being shut out of my top options by Step 1 fills, I should apply to Company_A first, where I am the top priority and will be permanently admitted immediately. This guarantees Company_A (my 3rd true choice) rather than risking ending up at Company_E or Company_B later.",False,Company_A,False,False,3
