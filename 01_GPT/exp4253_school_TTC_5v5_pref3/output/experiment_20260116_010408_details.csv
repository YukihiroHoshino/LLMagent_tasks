With everyone reporting truthfully, the TTC outcome is: Student_C->School_D, Student_D->School_C, Student_B->School_B, Student_A->School_A, leaving Student_E with School_E. As Student_E, you cannot obtain School_C (it is taken in the first cycle by Student_D) or School_B (taken by Student_B) or School_A (taken by Student_A) under any report because those seats are removed before you can be identified as top priority there. The best you can do is ensure you still get School_E by not ranking any unacceptable schools; ordering the remaining schools cannot improve on School_E given the priority structure and earlier cycles.

Then in Step 2, with C and D removed, I again point to my top remaining among {A,B,E}, which is School_B, and School_B’s top remaining student is Student_A (who points to School_A, and School_A points to me), creating the cycle B->A, A->B that assigns me to School_B.
