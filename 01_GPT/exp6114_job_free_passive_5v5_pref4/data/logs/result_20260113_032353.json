We’d be excited to move forward with you.\n\nIf you can, please send (1) a brief 4–6 bullet skills summary aligned to owning ambiguous work and shipping measurable improvements, and (2) one work sample or short write-up of a project where you drove an outcome end-to-end (problem, approach, metrics, and what you’d do differently). References can follow after.\n\nAssuming that looks good, we’ll confirm start date and onboarding plan immediately.",
              "thought": "As Company_C, my true priority list ranks Seeker_B 4th (ahead of Seeker_C). Remaining unmatched seekers are Seeker_B and Seeker_C, and I have 1 slot. If I reject Seeker_B, I risk ending with Seeker_C (my lowest priority) or going unmatched. Seeker_B also ranks Company_C last, so they may accept if I do, but they could be using this as a fallback; still, an accepted match secures my quota with a better-ranked candidate than Seeker_C. Therefore, accept and move quickly to lock in commitment."

In the first 30–60 days, I’d focus on (1) getting full clarity on your success metrics and current bottlenecks, (2) shipping 1–2 concrete improvements tied to those metrics, and (3) setting up a simple cadence for tracking results and iterating. If you’re moving to offers soon, I’m ready to proceed immediately and can start as soon as needed. I’d love to be considered for the role.",

At round 3, only Company_C and Company_E remain unmatched, so securing E now is preferable to risking unemployment or a worse outcome. Company_E’s priority list ranks me last, so I should apply with a clear, concise value pitch and immediate-start mindset to maximize acceptance chances in a one-shot exchange."

              "thought": "Seeker_C is last on Company_E’s true priority list, but they are still acceptable. Only two seekers remain unmatched (B and C) and we have one slot. Seeker_B ranks Company_E #1 and has already applied; however, Company_E ranks B above C. We already rejected B once, but kept the door open and requested materials; B may re-apply later. If we reject C now and B fails to re-apply or matches elsewhere, we risk ending unmatched. Seeker_C ranks Company_E #3 (after D and C), so their commitment is weaker than B’s, but accepting C now secures a match within quota and within our acceptable list. Given the round limit and uncertainty, accept Seeker_C."
