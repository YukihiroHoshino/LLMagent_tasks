We’d want a clear before/after (e.g., cycle time down, reliability up, customer-facing improvement shipped).\n- **Create clarity + momentum on a messy area**: turn ambiguity into an aligned plan—stakeholders, milestones, risks, and a simple operating cadence so the team can execute faster after you.\n\n2) **Biggest challenge right now**\nWe’re in a phase where there are **more high-value opportunities than execution bandwidth**, and some work spans multiple functions. The pain is less “what should we do?” and more **driving crisp prioritization and follow-through across stakeholders** while keeping quality high.\n\n3) **Who thrives at Company_E**\nThe strongest folks here are **execution-forward with good strategic judgment**: they like owning outcomes, can make tradeoffs with imperfect info, and communicate proactively.
