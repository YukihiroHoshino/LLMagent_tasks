By ~90 days we want stakeholders to feel they can “hand you ambiguity” and you’ll turn it into execution.\n\n(2) Hiring timeline / decision process\nWe’re moving quickly. Typical flow is: application → short screen → focused interview loop → decision. If things go well, we aim to make a decision within ~1–2 rounds from the application (often within 1–2 weeks depending on scheduling).\n\nYes—please do map your experience to the success metrics.

              "thought": "Seeker_A is last on our true priority list. However, it is round 30, we have remaining quota 1, and Seeker_A is the only unmatched seeker left and is strongly committed to accept immediately. Given the end of the market and preference to fill with someone on the list rather than leave unfilled, we should proceed but only after receiving the concrete gating work sample and references; seeker has not yet provided them, only intent. Since seeker sent [TALK], we cannot accept; we should give a one-sentence blocker and a single-sentence top priority prompt to enable them to send the sample and then apply, though time is effectively out. Still, comply with protocol: respond [TALK] and request they paste the work sample and references immediately and then send [APPLY]."
