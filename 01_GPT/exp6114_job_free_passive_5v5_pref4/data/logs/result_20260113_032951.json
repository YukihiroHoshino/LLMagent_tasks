The goal is to stabilize it and deliver a measurable improvement—e.g., shorter cycle time, fewer defects/escalations, and clearer stakeholder visibility.\n\nWhat distinguishes an excellent candidate (for that specific need) vs. an average one:\n- Excellent: quickly diagnoses the real bottleneck (not just symptoms), defines success metrics up front, and ships an improvement end-to-end within the first 60–90 days. They align stakeholders early, make crisp tradeoffs, and keep a tight operating cadence (clear written updates, risks surfaced early, decisions driven).\n- Average: focuses on activity over outcomes, waits for perfect clarity, or improves one piece without aligning the full set of stakeholders—so results aren’t measurable or don’t stick.\n\nIf that sounds aligned, I’d love to move quickly. Can you share one example where you streamlined a messy process or delivered a measurable improvement under ambiguity (metric, your role, what you changed)? If it maps well, I’ll encourage you to submit an application and we’ll prioritize next steps right away.",

They have shown strong interest and are asking fit-clarifying questions; best move is to actively appeal, answer concretely, and prompt them to apply so we can accept quickly if they do."

Seeker_B ranks Company_E as #1, so accepting now likely yields a stable match and avoids ending up with only Seeker_C (ranked below B) or going unfilled.
