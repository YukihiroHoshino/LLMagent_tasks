If you share your earliest realistic start date and any constraints, we’ll align.\n\n(2) Top 2 skills/experiences we’ll use to decide between finalists:\n- Cross-functional execution leadership: clear ownership/decision rights, running an operating cadence, unblocking stakeholders, and driving a scoped initiative to a measurable outcome.\n- Analytical problem diagnosis + metric-driven improvement: quickly identifying where work is getting stuck (using data + interviews), choosing the right leading indicators, and delivering a concrete cycle-time/quality/rework improvement.\n\nIf you send a brief 30-60-90 plan tailored to the execution bottleneck (even bullets), we can use that as the basis for the next step.
