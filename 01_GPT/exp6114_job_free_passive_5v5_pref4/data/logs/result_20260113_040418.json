I’m ready to move quickly and can ramp fast, take ownership of ambiguous work, and communicate clearly with stakeholders to deliver measurable outcomes.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a concise 30/60/90-day plan, but first: what are the top 1–2 outcomes you need this hire to deliver in the first 60–90 days, and what would “success” look like by day 30?",

I have not applied to Company_A yet, so I should [APPLY]. Company_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (behind Seeker_E), so I should signal strong interest and readiness to move quickly to improve acceptance odds if they’re deciding between candidates."

We’re excited about your interest and your focus on ramping quickly, owning ambiguity, and driving measurable outcomes.\n\n**Top outcomes we need in the first 60–90 days**\n1) **Ship an end-to-end, high-impact deliverable** that moves a core team metric (e.g., activation/conversion, retention, or operational throughput)—including scoping, stakeholder alignment, execution, and rollout.\n2) **Establish a reliable operating cadence** with cross-functional partners (clear priorities, crisp updates, and decision-making) so execution becomes faster and more predictable.\n\n**What success looks like by day 30**\n- Fully ramped on product/customer context and current priorities.\n- Ownership of a clearly-defined problem area with an agreed success metric.\n- A concrete execution plan and at least one early, shipped improvement or milestone delivered.\n\nIf you’re willing, please send a concise 30/60/90-day plan tailored to the above—bullet format is perfect. We can move very quickly from there.\n\nWe’d like to move forward with you for this role. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #2 on Company_A’s true priority list, and we still have full quota (1) with only two seekers left unmatched (A and C). Accepting Seeker_C secures a very high-priority match immediately and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if Seeker_C matches elsewhere. Seeker_C’s preferences place Company_A 4th, so we should actively close now. We can answer their questions briefly while accepting to lock the match."
