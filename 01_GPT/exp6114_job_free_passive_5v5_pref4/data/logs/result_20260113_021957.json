We’re excited about the ownership and stakeholder communication you described, and we’d like to move forward.\n\nWe’re happy to extend an offer and match with you at Company_A. To finalize smoothly, please confirm: (1) your earliest start date, (2) location/remote preference, and (3) any key constraints we should account for (e.g., notice period).\n\nLooking forward to having you join and kicking off with a high-impact first 60–90 days plan.",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #2 on Company_A’s true priority list (only behind Seeker_E). With quota 1 and only two seekers remaining unmatched (A and C), accepting Seeker_C now secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for Seeker_E (not available). Seeker_A is lower priority (#4) and was already rejected. Therefore, accept Seeker_C and confirm next steps quickly."
