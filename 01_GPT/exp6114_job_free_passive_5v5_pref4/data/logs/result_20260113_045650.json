Your focus on ramping quickly, shipping early, and owning an area end-to-end is exactly how we think about success here.\n\n**Top outcomes we want in the first 60–90 days**\n1) **Ship a meaningful, measurable improvement** in a core workflow (identify the highest-leverage pain point, propose a solution, execute, and show impact via agreed metrics).\n2) **Establish clear ownership of a well-scoped area** with strong stakeholder alignment—i.e., you become the go-to person for that domain, with a crisp plan/roadmap and reliable execution/communication cadence.\n\n**What would make us say “clear success”**\n- You independently drive clarity from ambiguity (problem definition → options/tradeoffs → decision).\n- You deliver on time with quality, and the results are visible in metrics or user/stakeholder outcomes.\n- Partners trust you: proactive updates, good prioritization, and effective unblocking.\n\nWe’d be excited to move forward with you. If you accept, we can immediately schedule a kickoff to align on the first project area and success metrics. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Seeker_A is #2 on Company_B’s true priority list (very strong). Remaining unmatched seekers are A, C, E; our top choice D is already unavailable (likely matched). Seeker_A ranks Company_B as their #3 (after D and A), so they may accept if we move quickly. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_A now secures a high-priority match and avoids risk of ending with lower-priority C/E or no match if Seeker_A goes elsewhere."

I’m drawn to Company_A because I value clear ownership and high standards, and I’m confident I can ramp quickly and deliver reliable execution from day one. If selected, I’m ready to commit and start immediately. Thank you for considering my application—happy to share more about my experience and how I’d approach the first 30–60 days.",

I already applied to my top choice Company_D in round 1 but haven’t heard back; Company_D also ranks me 4th, so that outcome is uncertain. In the remaining market, Company_A is still available and ranks me 2nd (behind Seeker_E). Seeker_E prefers Company_D then Company_E then Company_C then Company_B then Company_A, so Seeker_E is unlikely to target Company_A early unless shut out elsewhere. To avoid ending up with my last choice (Company_B) or unemployed, I should actively pursue Company_A now rather than only talking. I have not applied to Company_A yet, so an [APPLY] is allowed and strategically strong."

Seeker_C is currently unmatched and has applied directly to us, signaling readiness to commit. While Seeker_C ranks Company_A 4th, Company_D and Company_C may be stronger competitors; delaying risks losing them. Accept now to secure a top-tier candidate rather than waiting for Seeker_E (who has only talked so far and ranks us last) and risking ending unmatched or with a lower-priority option."
