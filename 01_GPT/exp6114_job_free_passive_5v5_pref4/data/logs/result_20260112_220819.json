We’re looking for clear weekly progress updates, crisp written communication, and early identification of risks/dependencies.\n- Day 60: You’re independently driving a meaningful project end-to-end (requirements → execution → rollout), with measurable impact on reliability/quality (e.g., fewer defects/rework, tighter handoffs, better documentation).\n- Day 90: You’re operating as an owner for an area: setting priorities, coordinating cross-functionally with minimal oversight, and leaving behind repeatable process improvements (dashboards/docs/runbooks) so the team moves faster.\n\n2) Biggest challenge to tackle first\nThe immediate need is improving execution reliability while moving quickly—reducing rework and ambiguity across handoffs. The first project will likely involve clarifying requirements early, setting a lightweight process, and shipping an initial improvement within the first 4–6 weeks.\n\n3) Interview / selection timeline (next couple rounds)\nOver the next 1–2 rounds we’ll do: (a) a structured role/impact interview, (b) a practical exercise or case discussion, and (c) a final decision conversation.
