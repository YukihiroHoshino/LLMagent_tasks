The immediate need is to take a well-scoped slice end-to-end: clarify requirements/success metrics, align stakeholders (Product/Eng/Data/Go-to-market as needed), and ship a first measurable milestone. Concretely, success in 4–6 weeks looks like: a crisp plan with milestones + risks, stakeholder alignment, and delivery of the first increment that moves a core metric (or unblocks the next phase) rather than just producing docs.\n\n(2) Profile that tends to succeed here (skills/traits + collaboration style):\n- Strong “driver” mindset: turns ambiguity into a plan and executes without waiting for perfect inputs.\n- Structured communicator: concise written updates, clear tradeoffs, and proactive risk flagging.\n- Cross-functional operator: builds trust quickly, listens well, and can push for decisions respectfully.\n- Data/impact orientation: defines success metrics early and uses evidence to prioritize.\n- Pragmatic builder: ships iteratively and learns fast.\n\nIf that resonates, I’d like to propose next steps this week: a 30-minute role deep-dive + a 45-minute working session with a key partner team. If you’re aligned after that, we can move to an offer decision quickly.
