Before I formally apply, could you share what you’re prioritizing most in this hire (top 2–3 skills/traits) and your timeline/decision process? If there’s a specific area where you need immediate impact in the first 60–90 days, I’d love to tailor my application to that.",

If that aligns, I’ll ask you to formally apply and we’ll move fast from there.",

Seeker_B ranks Company_A #2, so could be attainable, but we should not commit yet; keep them warm while preserving option to match with higher-priority Seeker_E/Seeker_C. Provide clear criteria and ask for proof of fast delivery; do not invite immediate apply unless strong evidence, but can encourage sharing projects first."

I believe I’m a strong fit for what you emphasized (someone who can contribute quickly and collaborate smoothly): I’m decisive, communicate clearly, and can ramp fast while staying aligned with teammates. If you’re making a decision this round, I’m prepared to commit and start immediately—happy to share a brief, concrete example of how I’d deliver impact in the first few weeks if helpful.",
