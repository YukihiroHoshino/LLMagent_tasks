We’re excited about the potential for you to take end-to-end ownership quickly and deliver an early measurable win in the first 60–90 days.\n\nWe’d like to move ahead and match with you. [ACCEPT]\n\nOnce we’re confirmed, we’ll share next steps and an initial 30/60/90-day onboarding plan focus (problem scoping, first production deliverable, and stakeholder cadence).",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #2 on Company_A’s true priority list (only behind Seeker_E). At round 4, Seeker_C is the only unmatched seeker remaining, and Company_A still has full quota (1). Accepting now secures a very high-priority match with no downside risk, since waiting cannot yield Seeker_E (already not available) and the market is otherwise closed for us. Prior history is positive and indicates strong interest; accepting aligns with our stated ability to move quickly for the right fit."
