If you apply promptly, we can typically run an initial screen and a focused loop shortly after.\n\n**Top priorities in the first 60–90 days**\n1) **Ramp fast and take ownership of a well-scoped area**: get fluent in our product/customer context and internal workflows, then own a clearly defined problem with an agreed success metric.\n2) **Deliver a measurable win**: ship an improvement (feature/process/quality/ops) that has visible impact—e.g., faster cycle time, fewer defects, smoother stakeholder handoffs, or a key workflow unblocked.\n\n**What makes a candidate a clear “yes” right now**\n- **High ownership + follow-through** (can drive work end-to-end, not just contribute tasks)\n- **Structured problem solving** (clarifies goals/constraints, makes tradeoffs explicit)\n- **Proactive communication & stakeholder alignment** (keeps partners aligned, surfaces risks early)\n- **Evidence of delivering measurable outcomes** in a similar ambiguity/velocity environment\n\nIf this matches what you’re looking for, I’d encourage you to **apply this round** so we can keep momentum. To tailor the conversation: do you prefer **0→1/ambiguous discovery work** or **optimization/scale work with clear metrics**, and what’s one example of a measurable outcome you’re proud of delivering?",
