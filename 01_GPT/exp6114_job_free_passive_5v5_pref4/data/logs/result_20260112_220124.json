In the first 2–3 weeks I’d align on success metrics, map current workflows/ownership, and identify 1–2 “quick win” improvements to ship (process, quality, or delivery speed) while building trust with key stakeholders. I’m comfortable taking on ambiguous work, documenting decisions, and keeping communication tight to avoid surprises. \n\nIf helpful, could you share the top 1–2 problems you most need this hire to solve in the first 60–90 days? I can respond with a concrete plan for those priorities.",

Company_C’s priority list ranks me last, so I need to increase perceived fit and reduce their risk by being specific, flexible, and ready to start quickly.
