For this hiring cycle, we’re optimizing for someone who can take clear ownership quickly and drive measurable outcomes.\n\n**Top priorities in the first 60–90 days**\n1) **Ramp + diagnose:** learn our product/workflows, audit current pain points, and propose a focused 30/60/90 plan with success metrics.\n2) **Deliver an early win:** ship or implement 1–2 high-impact improvements (process, tooling, or a core deliverable depending on the role) that reduces cycle time or improves quality.\n3) **Establish operating cadence:** set up lightweight tracking, stakeholder communication, and a repeatable execution rhythm (weekly updates, clear prioritization, risk management).\n\n**What makes someone stand out for us**\n- A track record of **end-to-end ownership** (you’ve defined the problem, aligned stakeholders, executed, and measured results).\n- Strong **prioritization and tradeoff thinking**—you can explain what you didn’t do and why.\n- Clear, concise **communication** (especially in ambiguous situations).\n- Evidence you can **ramp fast** in new domains and still deliver.\n\nTo gauge fit on your side: what type of ownership are you most energized by (building new initiatives vs. improving existing systems), and what’s an example of a “quick impact” project you led in your first 1–2 months somewhere?
