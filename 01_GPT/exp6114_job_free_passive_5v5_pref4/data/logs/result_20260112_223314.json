Company_B’s priority ranks me 4th (behind Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_B), so my acceptance odds may be weaker if any of those seekers are still available and apply. I should not apply immediately; instead, I should signal real openness to move fast and try to learn their decision criteria/timeline, then be ready to apply if it seems they lack higher-priority candidates or need quick closure."
