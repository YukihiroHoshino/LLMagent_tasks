With truthful reporting, in round 1 everyone applies to their top choice; nurseries point to their top-priority remaining parent. Nursery_E points to Parent_E, Parent_E applies to Nursery_C, Nursery_C points to Parent_B, Parent_B applies to Nursery_E, forming a cycle (Parent_E->Nursery_C and Parent_B->Nursery_E) that clears first. Then among remaining, Nursery_A points to Parent_D and I apply to Nursery_E (full), so in the next round I apply to my best available (Nursery_A) and get it in a 2-cycle with Nursery_A. Thus my best achievable outcome is Nursery_A, and the optimal submission is my true preference order.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

With the full market info, Parent_E is the top priority at Nursery_E, but Nursery_E is last on your true list; meanwhile Nursery_C and Nursery_A are higher for you, and any attempt to game by ranking Nursery_E higher would risk locking into Nursery_E early via a self-loop. Therefore, submit your true preference order to maximize the chance of obtaining Nursery_C first, then Nursery_A, then Nursery_D, then Nursery_B, while keeping Nursery_E as the fallback.",True,Nursery_C,True,True,1
