I drove stakeholder alignment, redesigned the handoff/queueing steps, set SLAs/ownership, and ran the weekly metric review until the gains held.\n- ~40% error reduction: I was the DRI for the workflow change (root-cause analysis + process/validation changes + rollout). Team was 3 (me + 1 eng + 1 QA/ops). I wrote the spec, prioritized fixes, coordinated implementation, and created the monitoring/checklist that kept error rates down.\n- ~20% throughput increase: I co-led with a functional manager; I owned the operating cadence (intake/prioritization, WIP limits, weekly planning/review) and the dashboarding. Team was ~6 cross-functional.\n\n2) First metric I’d prioritize improving at Company_E\nI’d start with cycle time (end-to-end time from intake → shipped/closed), because it’s the best “forcing function” metric: it surfaces bottlenecks, clarifies ownership, and tends to improve throughput and quality when paired with a guardrail (error/defect rate).
