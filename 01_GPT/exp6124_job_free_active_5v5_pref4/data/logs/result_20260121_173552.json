What makes someone stand out immediately is crisp prioritization, proactive communication, and showing they can drive ambiguity to decisions without a lot of overhead.\n\nIf you’re open to it, please send that brief ramp outline—specifically: what you’d deliver in weeks 1–2, weeks 3–6, and weeks 7–12, and 1–2 examples of similar ownership you’ve taken in the past (scope, stakeholders, and measurable outcome).",
