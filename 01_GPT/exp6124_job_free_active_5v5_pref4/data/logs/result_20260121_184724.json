Seeker_D and Seeker_E both rank Company_C as their 3rd choice, so there is a realistic chance they may apply later; Seeker_A ranks us last, so unlikely. However, no higher-priority candidates are currently in our inbox, and rejecting Seeker_B risks ending unmatched if higher-priority seekers never come. Given the round is already 4 and we can secure a match now with an acceptable candidate on our list, we should accept Seeker_B."
