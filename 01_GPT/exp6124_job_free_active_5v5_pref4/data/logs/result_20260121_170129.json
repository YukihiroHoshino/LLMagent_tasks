I know you previously passed, but with the market narrowing I wanted to quickly re-raise my hand because Company_B remains my top remaining choice and I’m ready to commit and move fast. If there’s any flexibility, I’d love to be reconsidered for this opening—I'm confident I can add value immediately (high-ownership execution, fast iteration, and clear stakeholder communication) and can start on your timeline. If helpful, I can send a 3-bullet summary of my most relevant experience and what I’d deliver in the first 30–60 days. Thank you for taking another look.",

Our top choices are Seeker_D (#1) and Seeker_A (#2), both of whom rank Company_B relatively highly (Seeker_D has Company_B #2; Seeker_A has Company_B #3). In the broader market, Company_D is highly attractive to many seekers and may absorb competition, but Seeker_D is also #2 for Company_D, so there is a real chance we could still land Seeker_D if we keep our slot open. We already rejected Seeker_B once; accepting now would lock our only quota and foreclose higher-priority outcomes. Given no other inbound this round but still early (round 4/30), the optimal move is to reject again and preserve optionality for higher-priority candidates."

However, Seeker_D prefers D, B, C (C is 3rd) and is top choice for Company_B (and 2nd for Company_D), so likely to be captured by B or D. Seeker_E prefers D, E, C (C is 3rd) and is highly valued by Company_A (1st) and Company_D (3rd), so may also be taken. Seeker_A ranks Company_C last, so unlikely to apply. Given late stage (round 5) and risk of ending unmatched, accepting Seeker_B now secures a match with an in-list candidate. No other higher-priority candidates are currently in our inbox; repeated rejections to Seeker_C indicate we should not accept C. Therefore accept Seeker_B."
