Since all seekers list Company_D as their first choice, Seeker_B may apply to us in a later round if not matched elsewhere (though Seeker_B’s own top choice is Company_E, so they may secure Company_E quickly). With quota=1, accepting Seeker_D now locks in a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked candidate or no match if Seeker_B never becomes available.

If you use “closed” as the operational end state, then end = ticket_closed_at; otherwise resolved is better because “closed” often includes admin lag.\n- Reopens: if a ticket reopens, treat it as a new episode for TTR (episode_start = reopen_at, episode_end = subsequent resolved_at), and track reopen rate separately.\n\nCore tables/fields (minimal viable):\nA) tickets\n- ticket_id (PK)\n- created_at\n- current_status\n- severity\n- product_area\n- customer_tier\n- assigned_group (support/ops/eng)\n\nB) ticket_status_events (append-only event log)\n- ticket_id\n- event_ts (timestamp)\n- event_type (e.g., status_change, assignment_change, comment_added)\n- from_status\n- to_status\n- actor_role (support/ops/eng/system)\n\nC) ticket_milestones (derived; 1 row per ticket episode)\n- ticket_id\n- episode_id (0 for initial, 1..n for reopens)\n- start_ts (recommended: created_at for episode 0; reopen_ts for episode>0)\n- triage_ts (first time enters TRIAGED state OR first_support_touch_ts)\n- eng_touch_ts (first time assigned to Eng OR first_eng_comment_ts)\n- resolved_ts (first time enters RESOLVED)\n- closed_ts (first time enters CLOSED)\n- end_ts (recommended: resolved_ts; fallback: closed_ts)\n- data_quality_flags (array/string: missing_end, proxy_end, out_of_order, timezone_suspect, etc.)\n\nMilestone derivation logic (SQL-ish pseudocode):\n- start_ts:\n  - if episode_id=0: start_ts = tickets.created_at\n  - else: start_ts = reopen_event_ts\n- triage_ts = MIN(event_ts where to_status in ('TRIAGED','IN_PROGRESS_SUPPORT') OR actor_role='support' AND event_type in ('comment_added','assignment_change'))\n- eng_touch_ts = MIN(event_ts where assigned_group='eng' OR actor_role='eng' AND event_type in ('comment_added','assignment_change'))\n- resolved_ts = MIN(event_ts where to_status='RESOLVED')\n- closed_ts = MIN(event_ts where to_status='CLOSED')\n- end_ts precedence:\n  - end_ts = resolved_ts\n  - else end_ts = closed_ts\n  - else NULL (right-censored; exclude from p90 baseline but include in “open aging”)\n\nData quality handling rules baked into the query:\n- Exclude from p90 if end_ts is NULL (right-censored).\n- If end_ts < start_ts, set data_quality_flags += 'out_of_order' and set end_ts = NULL (so it doesn’t pollute the tail); track counts of these exceptions.\n- If timestamps are missing for intermediate milestones (triage/eng_touch), allow NULL; they’re for diagnostics/segmentation, not required for TTR.\n\nBaseline p90 query (example):\nWITH episodes AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    episode_id,\n    start_ts,\n    end_ts,\n    severity,\n    product_area,\n    assigned_group,\n    data_quality_flags,\n    TIMESTAMP_DIFF(end_ts, start_ts, HOUR) AS ttr_hours\n  FROM ticket_milestones\n  WHERE start_ts IS NOT NULL\n)\nSELECT\n  COUNT(*) AS n_closed,\n  APPROX_QUANTILES(ttr_hours, 100)[OFFSET(90)] AS p90_ttr_hours,\n  APPROX_QUANTILES(ttr_hours, 100)[OFFSET(50)] AS p50_ttr_hours\nFROM episodes\nWHERE end_ts IS NOT NULL\n  AND ttr_hours >= 0\n  AND NOT ARRAY_CONTAINS(data_quality_flags, 'out_of_order');\n\nSegmentation (to find p90 drivers):\n- Run the same query grouped by severity, product_area, and assigned_group.\n- Also compute “no-touch time” proxies (e.g., time from start_ts to first triage_ts; time from eng_touch_ts to resolved_ts) to pinpoint where the tail forms.\n\n2) Availability (next 48 hours) — please pick any\nTimezone: ET (UTC-5)\n- Window 1: Today 3:00–5:00 PM ET\n- Window 2: Tomorrow 10:00 AM–12:00 PM ET\n- Window 3: Tomorrow 4:00–6:00 PM ET\n\nIf you share what tooling you use (e.g., Zendesk/Jira/Salesforce + warehouse), I can adapt the event extraction and the exact precedence rules to match your source-of-truth fields.\n\n[TALK]",

If your taxonomy defines Pending as customer-wait, we can map Pending→PAUSE when a specific field/tag indicates “awaiting customer,” otherwise keep running.\n- **Blocked (dependency)** → **PAUSE** only when a dependency is explicitly logged (e.g., tag/custom field like `blocked_by_team`, `vendor`, `bugfix_required`). Otherwise treat as running but segment it as blocked. Capture `pause_reason='dependency'` + `dependency_type` if available.\n- **On Hold** → **PAUSE** when On Hold is used for policy/compliance or intentional defer (and we can identify it reliably); otherwise treat as running but segment.

We can adapt field names once we see your exact exports.\n\n---\n## 0) Assumptions / inputs\nTables (or staged views) we’ll have in Snowflake:\n- `zendesk_tickets` (ticket_id, created_at, updated_at, status, priority, tags, group_id, assignee_id, requester_id, custom_severity, jira_key, etc.)\n- `zendesk_ticket_audits` (ticket_id, audit_id, audit_created_at, events VARIANT)\n  - where `events` contains field changes; we’ll flatten to get status changes.\n\nCanonical status values:\n- Open, Pending, On-hold, Solved (and any others you use)\n\n---\n## 1) Flatten audits → status change events\n```sql\nWITH audit_events AS (\n  SELECT\n    a.ticket_id,\n    a.audit_id,\n    a.audit_created_at AS event_ts,\n    e.value AS event\n  FROM zendesk_ticket_audits a,\n  , LATERAL FLATTEN(input => a.events) e\n),\nstatus_change_events AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    audit_id,\n    event_ts,\n    /* adjust paths to match your audit export */\n    event:\"field_name\"::string          AS field_name,\n    event:\"previous_value\"::string      AS from_value,\n    event:\"value\"::string               AS to_value\n  FROM audit_events\n  WHERE field_name = 'status'\n),\nstatus_events_dedup AS (\n  SELECT *\n  FROM (\n    SELECT\n      ticket_id,\n      event_ts,\n      from_value AS from_status,\n      to_value   AS to_status,\n      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ticket_id, event_ts ORDER BY audit_id) AS rn\n    FROM status_change_events\n  )\n  WHERE rn = 1\n)\n```\n\n---\n## 2) Construct ordered status spans (enter_ts → next_enter_ts)\n```sql\n, ordered_status_events AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    event_ts AS status_enter_ts,\n    to_status AS status,\n    LEAD(event_ts) OVER (PARTITION BY ticket_id ORDER BY event_ts) AS next_status_enter_ts\n  FROM status_events_dedup\n),\nstatus_spans AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    status,\n    status_enter_ts,\n    COALESCE(next_status_enter_ts, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS status_exit_ts,\n    DATEDIFF('second', status_enter_ts, COALESCE(next_status_enter_ts, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())) AS span_seconds\n  FROM ordered_status_events\n  WHERE status_enter_ts IS NOT NULL\n)\n```\nNotes:\n- Using `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` for the open-ended final span lets us compute “open aging” and paused time-to-date.\n\n---\n## 3) Episode splitting on reopens (Solved → Open/Pending)\nWe define an “episode” as: start at ticket created (episode 0) or at a reopen transition; end at the next Solved.\n\n```sql\n, reopen_markers AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    status_enter_ts AS reopen_ts,\n    1 AS is_reopen\n  FROM status_spans\n  WHERE status IN ('Open','Pending')\n    AND LAG(status) OVER (PARTITION BY ticket_id ORDER BY status_enter_ts) = 'Solved'\n),\nepisode_boundaries AS (\n  /* episode 0 start */\n  SELECT t.ticket_id, 0 AS episode_id, t.created_at AS episode_start_ts\n  FROM zendesk_tickets t\n\n  UNION ALL\n\n  /* episode starts at each reopen */\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY ticket_id ORDER BY reopen_ts) AS episode_id,\n    reopen_ts AS episode_start_ts\n  FROM reopen_markers\n),\nepisode_solved_events AS (\n  /* first Solved after each episode_start */\n  SELECT\n    eb.ticket_id,\n    eb.episode_id,\n    eb.episode_start_ts,\n    MIN(se.status_enter_ts) AS solved_ts\n  FROM episode_boundaries eb\n  LEFT JOIN status_spans se\n    ON se.ticket_id = eb.ticket_id\n   AND se.status = 'Solved'\n   AND se.status_enter_ts > eb.episode_start_ts\n  GROUP BY 1,2,3\n),\nepisodes AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    episode_id,\n    episode_start_ts AS start_ts,\n    solved_ts        AS end_ts,\n    CASE WHEN solved_ts IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_right_censored\n  FROM episode_solved_events\n)\n```\n\n---\n## 4) Label spans for inclusive segmentation + paused-clock\nWe’ll apply the draft rules:\n- Inclusive segmentation: always label spans, never pause inclusive.\n- Paused-clock: pause only for Waiting on Customer, and selectively for Blocked/On Hold if reliably tagged.\n\nBecause Zendesk “status” alone may not distinguish Waiting-on-Customer vs internal pending, we can use tags/custom fields if available. For now, treat:\n- `Pending` → inclusive segment “Internal Pending” by default.\n- If we have a tag like `awaiting_customer` then treat as customer-wait.\n\n```sql\n, span_enriched AS (\n  SELECT\n    s.ticket_id,\n    s.status,\n    s.status_enter_ts,\n    s.status_exit_ts,\n    s.span_seconds,\n    t.tags,\n    /* INCLUSIVE segmentation label */\n    CASE\n      WHEN s.status = 'Pending' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('awaiting_customer'::variant, t.tags) THEN 'Customer Wait'\n      WHEN s.status = 'Pending' THEN 'Internal Pending'\n      WHEN s.status = 'On-hold' THEN 'On Hold / Deferred'\n      WHEN s.status = 'Open' THEN 'Open / Active'\n      WHEN s.status = 'Solved' THEN 'Solved (post-work)'\n      ELSE 'Other'\n    END AS inclusive_segment,\n\n    /* PAUSED-CLOCK flag */\n    CASE\n      WHEN s.status = 'Pending' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('awaiting_customer'::variant, t.tags) THEN 1\n      /* optional: blocked/hold pausing only if reliably tagged */\n      WHEN s.status = 'On-hold' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('policy_hold'::variant, t.tags) THEN 1\n      WHEN s.status = 'Open' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('blocked_dependency'::variant, t.tags) THEN 1\n      ELSE 0\n    END AS is_paused,\n\n    CASE\n      WHEN s.status = 'Pending' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('awaiting_customer'::variant, t.tags) THEN 'customer'\n      WHEN s.status = 'On-hold' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('policy_hold'::variant, t.tags) THEN 'hold'\n      WHEN s.status = 'Open' AND ARRAY_CONTAINS('blocked_dependency'::variant, t.tags) THEN 'dependency'\n      ELSE NULL\n    END AS pause_reason\n\n  FROM status_spans s\n  JOIN zendesk_tickets t\n    ON t.ticket_id = s.ticket_id\n)\n```\n\n---\n## 5) Attach spans to episodes + compute inclusive vs active-work TTR\nWe attach spans that overlap an episode window [start_ts, end_ts). For censored episodes, we can use `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` as a provisional end for “aging” but exclude from p90.\n\n```sql\n, episode_windows AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    episode_id,\n    start_ts,\n    COALESCE(end_ts, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()) AS window_end_ts,\n    end_ts,\n    is_right_censored\n  FROM episodes\n),\nspans_in_episode AS (\n  SELECT\n    ew.ticket_id,\n    ew.episode_id,\n    ew.start_ts,\n    ew.end_ts,\n    ew.is_right_censored,\n    se.inclusive_segment,\n    se.is_paused,\n\n    /* overlap math */\n    GREATEST(se.status_enter_ts, ew.start_ts) AS overlap_start,\n    LEAST(se.status_exit_ts, ew.window_end_ts) AS overlap_end,\n    DATEDIFF('second',\n      GREATEST(se.status_enter_ts, ew.start_ts),\n      LEAST(se.status_exit_ts, ew.window_end_ts)\n    ) AS overlap_seconds\n  FROM episode_windows ew\n  JOIN span_enriched se\n    ON se.ticket_id = ew.ticket_id\n   AND se.status_exit_ts > ew.start_ts\n   AND se.status_enter_ts < ew.window_end_ts\n),\nspans_in_episode_clean AS (\n  SELECT *\n  FROM spans_in_episode\n  WHERE overlap_seconds > 0\n),\nepisode_metrics AS (\n  SELECT\n    ticket_id,\n    episode_id,\n    start_ts,\n    end_ts,\n    is_right_censored,\n\n    /* inclusive */\n    DATEDIFF('second', start_ts, end_ts) AS inclusive_ttr_seconds,\n\n    /* paused time */\n    SUM(CASE WHEN is_paused=1 THEN overlap_seconds ELSE 0 END) AS paused_seconds,\n\n    /* active-work */\n    DATEDIFF('second', start_ts, end_ts)\n      - SUM(CASE WHEN is_paused=1 THEN overlap_seconds ELSE 0 END) AS active_work_ttr_seconds\n  FROM spans_in_episode_clean\n  WHERE end_ts IS NOT NULL\n  GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5\n)\n```\n\n---\n## 6) p90 baseline + segmentation outputs\nOverall p90:\n```sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT(*) AS n,\n  APPROX_PERCENTILE(inclusive_ttr_seconds/3600.0, 0.90) AS p90_inclusive_ttr_hours,\n  APPROX_PERCENTILE(active_work_ttr_seconds/3600.0, 0.90) AS p90_active_work_ttr_hours\nFROM episode_metrics\nWHERE is_right_censored = 0\n  AND inclusive_ttr_seconds >= 0\n  AND active_work_ttr_seconds >= 0;\n```\n\nTail-driver segmentation (share of time by segment within episodes):\n```sql\nSELECT\n  inclusive_segment,\n  SUM(overlap_seconds)/3600.0 AS hours_in_segment,\n  COUNT(DISTINCT ticket_id || '-' || episode_id) AS episodes_touched\nFROM spans_in_episode_clean\nWHERE end_ts IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY hours_in_segment DESC;\n```\n\n---\n## 7) Data quality flags (exceptions)\n```sql\nSELECT\n  COUNT_IF(end_ts IS NULL) AS right_censored_episodes,\n  COUNT_IF(end_ts < start_ts) AS out_of_order_episodes\nFROM episodes;\n```\n\nIf you want, I can also bring a variant that computes **“time since last touch”** (e.g., last public comment or assignment change) to power the “stuck queue” alerting directly from the same audit/event log.\n\nSee you tomorrow at 10:30–11:15 AM ET.\n\n[TALK]",

Thanks for sending the Snowflake CTE outline; it’s in the exact shape we can adapt quickly once we plug in our audit export paths and tag/custom-field logic.\n\nTwo quick clarifications to make tomorrow’s session maximally efficient:\n1) In the `reopen_markers` CTE, you’re using `LAG(status)` over `status_spans`. In Snowflake, we may want to compute that lag off the ordered status events (enter points) rather than spans to avoid edge cases—are you comfortable with us shifting that to the event-level ordering if needed?\n2) For the paused-clock logic: since we have explicit statuses like **Waiting on Customer** and **Blocked**, do you prefer we pause based on status alone (more reliable than tags), with tags/custom fields only as overrides?\n\nWe’ll send the calendar hold to seeker.b@email.com (10:30–11:15 AM ET) along with the status taxonomy + audit sample shortly. Looking forward to working through this live.\n\n[TALK]",

However, since Seeker_B is not our top priority and we have no confirmation that higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D/Seeker_E/Seeker_A) are unavailable, we should not ACCEPT. We should keep Seeker_B warm via TALK, confirm receipt, and maintain optionality while we continue pursuing higher-priority matches within quota 1."

That’s cleaner and avoids span edge cases; the intent is simply to detect the transition Solved → (Open/Pending) and start a new episode at that reopen_ts.\n\n2) Paused-clock: given you have explicit statuses **Waiting on Customer** and **Blocked**, I’d prefer pausing based on **status alone as the primary rule** (more reliable than tags). Then use tags/custom fields only as overrides/refinements (e.g., Blocked-by-customer vs Blocked-by-dependency, or cases where Pending is actually awaiting customer).\n\nSeparately, I’d like to formally apply for the role. Based on what you’ve shared, this intake→triage→resolution p90 TTR workstream is exactly the kind of ambiguous, cross-functional, metrics-driven execution I do well, and I’m ready to move quickly if you decide to pivot.\n\nSee you tomorrow 10:30–11:15 AM ET — once I receive the audit sample/status taxonomy, I’ll come in with the adjusted event-level reopen logic + a status-first paused-clock mapping ready to finalize live.\n\n[APPLY]",
