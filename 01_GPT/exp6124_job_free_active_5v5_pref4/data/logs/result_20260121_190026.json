Per your request, here’s a concise write-up focused on **ops/process with an analytics spine** (intake → execution → QA/feedback, SLAs, instrumentation). I kept it tight but concrete.\n\n---\n## Project: Stabilizing & scaling a cross-functional request intake + fulfillment workflow\n### 1) Ambiguous starting point + framing\n**Starting ambiguity:** We had a high-volume internal “requests” channel (ops + analytics support) with unclear ownership, inconsistent quality, and unpredictable turnaround. Stakeholders complained about “black box” status; the team felt whiplash from interruptions.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Duplicate/low-quality requests, unclear requirements\n- No prioritization rubric; everything treated as urgent\n- No SLA expectations; frequent escalations\n- Rework due to missing QA and unclear acceptance criteria\n\n**Framing:** I defined the problem as: *“Create a predictable, transparent system that (a) reduces avoidable demand, (b) makes throughput measurable, and (c) improves quality with a lightweight QA loop—without slowing urgent work.”*\n\n### 2) Workflow design (intake → execution → QA/feedback) + SLAs/ownership\n**Ownership model (RACI-style):**\n- **Intake Owner (me for rollout, then rotating):** triage, de-dupe, clarify requirements\n- **Executor:** delivers work; updates status at defined checkpoints\n- **Reviewer/QA:** validates output against acceptance criteria\n- **Requester:** provides required inputs; signs off\n\n**Intake form (lightweight but enforced):**\n- Request type, goal/decision to be made, deadline, required inputs, definition of done\n- Priority driver (customer impact, revenue risk, compliance, exec request, etc.)\n\n**Triage cadence:** 15 min daily + 30 min weekly prioritization with key stakeholders.\n\n**SLA tiers (published + agreed):**\n- **P0 (incident/blocker):** acknowledge <1 hr; first update <4 hrs\n- **P1 (time-sensitive):** acknowledge same day; deliver 2–3 business days\n- **P2 (standard):** acknowledge 1 business day; deliver 5–7 business days\n\n**Execution stage gates:**\n1) **Clarify & scope (same day for P0/P1):** confirm acceptance criteria + tradeoffs\n2) **Deliver v1:** with changelog + assumptions\n3) **QA/review:** checklist-based (accuracy, completeness, stakeholder fit)\n4) **Close-out:** requester sign-off + tag root cause category\n\n### 3) Metrics (leading + lagging) + instrumentation\n**Leading indicators:**\n- % requests with complete intake fields (quality of demand)\n- Time-to-first-response (responsiveness)\n- WIP per executor (load)\n- Reopen/rework rate (process quality)\n\n**Lagging indicators:**\n- SLA attainment by tier\n- Cycle time (request created → closed)\n- Stakeholder satisfaction (quick pulse)\n- Volume by category (demand trends)\n\n**Instrumentation:**\n- Single source of truth board (statuses: New → Triaged → In Progress → QA → Waiting on Requester → Done)\n- Required fields enforced at intake\n- Weekly dashboard: volume, SLA %, cycle time distribution, top rework drivers\n\n### 4) Stakeholders + alignment + tradeoffs\n**Stakeholders:** ops leads, analytics consumers, and a small execution team.\n\n**Alignment approach:**\n- Socialized the SLA tiers + priority rubric in a 30-min working session\n- Got explicit agreement on “what qualifies as P0/P1” to reduce escalation noise\n- Set a comms cadence: daily triage note + weekly summary (wins, bottlenecks, upcoming)\n\n**Tradeoffs:**\n- Chose *lightweight* intake requirements to avoid blocking urgent work, but made “definition of done” mandatory to reduce rework.\n- Accepted that some P0 work would interrupt flow, but required post-incident tagging to prevent repeat demand.\n\n### 5) Outcomes + next iterations\n**Outcomes (first ~6 weeks):**\n- SLA attainment increased materially (especially for standard work) after publishing tiers and enforcing triage\n- Cycle time variance narrowed (fewer extreme outliers)\n- Rework/reopen rate dropped after adding acceptance criteria + QA checklist\n- Stakeholders reported higher trust due to visible status + predictable updates\n\n**Next iteration ideas:**\n- Add a “self-serve” layer for top repeat request types (templates, FAQs, automated reports)\n- Introduce capacity planning (weekly forecast) and explicit WIP limits\n- Run a monthly retro on top demand drivers and eliminate upstream causes\n\n---\nIf helpful, I can also do the alternative prompt (2-week stabilize + 6-week improve plan) tailored to *your* current process; just tell me what the messiest workflow is right now (intake, incident response, reporting, etc.).\n\nIf this is on target, I’d appreciate confirmation of next steps (e.g., quick call or a short paid exercise).

Two questions to prep:\n1) If stakeholders refuse to honor the priority rubric and everything comes in as “P1,” what specific mechanisms would you use in week 1–2 to regain control?\n2) What are the first 5 metrics you’d put on a weekly dashboard for leadership, and what decision would each metric drive?\n\nIf you’re open, send 2–3 time windows in the next 48 hours and I’ll confirm.

Below are my prep answers, plus availability.\n\n**1) If everything comes in as “P1,” how I’d regain control (week 1–2):**\n- **Define an explicit “P1 contract” + require a trigger:** P1 must map to a concrete trigger (e.g., customer-impacting, revenue-at-risk threshold, compliance deadline, exec escalation). If no trigger, it’s P2 by default.\n- **Intake gating with required fields + “waiting on requester” stop-the-clock:** no acceptance criteria/owner/deadline/impact → it doesn’t enter WIP; it sits in “Waiting on Requester.” This reduces drive-by urgency without me being the bad guy.\n- **Capacity-based triage + published WIP limits:** set a weekly capacity number (e.g., X slots for P1, Y for P2). When P1 slots are full, new “P1” requests must displace an existing one (with stakeholder approval) so the tradeoff is explicit.\n- **Single escalation path + escalation tax:** require escalations to go through one channel/owner, and log them. In week 1, I’d review the top 3 sources of escalations and fix upstream causes (missing info, unclear ownership, poor comms).\n- **Weekly prioritization with decision-makers:** 30 minutes with the right leads to ratify the queue. If someone wants “everything P1,” they must decide what gets dropped.\n\n**2) First 5 weekly leadership dashboard metrics + decisions they drive:**\n1. **SLA attainment by tier (P0/P1/P2):** decide whether to add capacity, reduce scope, or tighten intake; validates if the system is working.\n2. **Cycle time (median + p90) by request type:** decide where bottlenecks are and which workflow step needs redesign (triage, execution, QA, waiting on requester).\n3. **WIP + aging (count in progress + # items > SLA/aging buckets):** decide whether to enforce WIP limits, pause new intake, or reassign owners.\n4. **Intake quality (% requests meeting “ready” criteria on first submission):** decide whether to improve templates/training or add self-serve/automation for common requests.\n5. **Rework/reopen rate (and top causes):** decide whether to invest in QA/checklists, clearer acceptance criteria, or upstream requirement gathering.\n\n**Availability (next 48 hours):**\n- Today: 3:00–5:30pm\n- Tomorrow: 10:00am–12:00pm or 2:00–4:30pm\n- Following day: 9:00–11:00am\n(If you share your timezone, I’ll align precisely—assume mine is local to this message.)\n\nIf you confirm a slot, I’ll show up ready to apply this directly to your current workflow and constraints.",
