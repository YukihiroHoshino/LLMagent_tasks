As requested (all in one message) to enable a fast Round-15 decision:\n\n1) <2-week delivery example (exact milestone / stakeholders / measurable outcome):\n- Milestone delivered: Delivered a cross-functional “v1 go-live readiness” milestone for a high-urgency launch: finalized requirements + success metrics, dependency map, execution plan, and shipped the enabling changes needed to hit the go-live date.\n- Stakeholders/team: ~8–10 core contributors across Product, Eng (3), Data/Analytics, Design, Ops, and a GTM/CS lead; plus 2 exec stakeholders for approvals.\n- Measurable outcome: Hit the go-live date within 10 business days from kickoff; cleared all launch-blocking dependencies by the agreed cutover; produced a single source-of-truth tracker and weekly status readout that reduced open-risk items from double-digits to 0 by launch.\n\n2) Stakeholder-management example (key conflict / decision points / what shipped/changed):\n- Key conflict: Engineering wanted to de-scope to reduce risk; GTM/CS needed specific functionality for customer commitments; Product wanted to preserve the original scope.\n- Decision points I drove: (a) “must-have vs. can-wait” scope cutoff by a fixed date, (b) ownership and due-dates for each dependency, (c) explicit go/no-go criteria tied to measurable checks.\n- Result shipped/changed: Locked a reduced-but-sufficient MVP scope with signed-off go/no-go criteria; unblocked execution by assigning clear owners and deadlines; shipped the MVP on time and moved deferred items into a sequenced follow-on plan with dates and owners.\n\n3) 7-day plan (for an ambiguous cross-functional deliverable; assumptions OK):\nDay 1: Confirm objective + success metrics; identify stakeholders/DRIs; draft a one-page brief + initial risk list. Day 2: Break into workstreams, dependencies, and a milestone plan; set cadence (daily async + 2x weekly sync); create a single tracker (RACI + dates). Day 3: Align on scope cut lines and decision points; secure approvals on go/no-go criteria; start execution on highest-risk dependencies. Day 4–5: Drive execution + unblockers; run tight check-ins; escalate early on slippage; keep tracker current and publish status. Day 6: Validate deliverable against metrics; run pre-brief with key stakeholders; finalize launch/readiness checklist. Day 7: Deliver milestone (demo/hand-off); document decisions, remaining risks, and next-step plan; confirm owners for follow-on.\n\nIf helpful, I can reformat the above into your internal template (one-pager + tracker) immediately.
