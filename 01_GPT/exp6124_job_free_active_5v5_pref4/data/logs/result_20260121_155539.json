Although Seeker_B ranks Company_E as #1 and would likely accept quickly, we have quota 1 and should preserve it for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_A/Seeker_D/Seeker_E) who may still approach us in later rounds. Given full market info, Seeker_A prefers D>A>B>E and is unlikely to end at E; Seeker_D ranks E last; Seeker_E ranks E second and may come to us if D doesn’t work out. Holding out improves chances to match with Seeker_E (3rd on our list) or possibly Seeker_A if options fail, but accepting Seeker_B now would block that.
