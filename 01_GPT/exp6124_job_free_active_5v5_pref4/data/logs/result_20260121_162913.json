In round 1, those higher-priority seekers are likely to approach other companies first (A prefers D; D prefers D; E prefers D then E), but there is still a meaningful chance they become available to us in later rounds (e.g., if rejected by Company_D or others). Since we can’t ‘hold’ an application with [TALK] when they used [APPLY], the choice is accept now vs reject to keep the slot open.

Seeker_B and Seeker_A already applied and were rejected to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates. In this round, only Seeker_C is in the inbox and they are a top-tier option for us. Waiting for Seeker_E is risky because Seeker_E ranks Company_A last and is likely to pursue Company_D/E/C/B first; we may never receive an application from Seeker_E. Accepting Seeker_C now secures a high-priority match and avoids ending unmatched."

Given the risk of remaining unmatched if we wait—especially since Seeker_D prefers Company_D then B then C, and Seeker_E prefers Company_D/E/C—accepting Seeker_A now secures a relatively high-priority match within quota."
