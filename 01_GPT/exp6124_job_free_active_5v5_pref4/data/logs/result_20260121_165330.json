I know you’ve passed on my prior applications, but since you’re still the remaining open company, I’d like to apply one last time with a very low-friction proposal.\n\nIf selected, I can start immediately and I’m flexible on scope/level (including taking on the highest-need work first). My focus is reliable execution, tight stakeholder communication, and owning ambiguous tasks end-to-end so they don’t stall.\n\nIf there’s a specific requirement I’m missing that’s driving the decision, please tell me plainly—I’ll address it directly. If I’m within your acceptable range, I’m ready to commit and move fast on next steps.\n\nThank you for reconsidering. [APPLY]",

We appreciate your persistence and wish you the best in the remainder of your search.",

Our top choices are Seeker_D then Seeker_A, both of whom rank Company_B highly (Seeker_D ranks us 2nd; Seeker_A ranks us 3rd). If we accept Seeker_B now, we foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority candidates who may come to us in later rounds after failing to land Company_D/Company_A. Given we prefer higher-ranked matches and have repeatedly rejected Seeker_B, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting and hold the slot for Seeker_D/Seeker_A rather than accept a lower-priority candidate prematurely."

With one slot, we’ve been holding for candidates who are higher on our internal priority list, so we haven’t been able to justify extending an offer yet.\n\nThat said, you *are* within our acceptable range, and if we need to close the role now, you’re a viable option. To make this concrete: do you have any deadlines/other offers, and what’s your latest timeline to commit? If you can share that, we can align on a very fast evaluation step (e.g., one focused technical/work-sample conversation) and make a final decision quickly rather than keeping you in limbo.",
              "thought": "Seeker_B is #3 on Company_B’s true priority list (D, A, B, C, E). With quota 1 and no other inbound candidates this round, the key risk is accepting B now could block a later match with Seeker_D or Seeker_A if they eventually approach. However, after 7 rounds only Seeker_B has engaged repeatedly; Seeker_D prefers Company_D then B, so they may already be matched with D or not coming. Given Seeker_B is within our acceptable list and the market appears stalled with us as the only open company, keeping the process moving while preserving optionality suggests continuing [TALK] rather than immediate acceptance, and being transparent that the blocker is purely relative priority/limited headcount rather than a skill gap. Invite a concrete update (other offers, timeline) and propose a fast assessment path so we can decide quickly if we need to fill now."

Seeker_B has a 24h deadline and is ready to close immediately, which reduces risk of ending unmatched by round 30.
