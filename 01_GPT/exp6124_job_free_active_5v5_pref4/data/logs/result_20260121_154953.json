Per your request, here’s my closest mapping in 3 bullets:\n\n• Partnered with Product/Eng to change the system (not just process): I co-led implementation of policy/risk controls directly in the case-management/product workflow—adding required data capture fields, automated gating/holds for specific risk triggers, an escalation queue with routing logic, and reviewer tooling (reason codes + structured outcomes) so decisions were consistent and machine-readable.\n\n• What I measured: tracked exception/loss proxies and quality/funnel metrics end-to-end—policy-miss rate (false negatives), over-flag rate (false positives), audit pass rate, appeal/overturn rate, median time-to-resolution (customer friction), and volume by risk tier. I used weekly dashboards/WBRs to align Product/Ops/Compliance on the tradeoffs.\n\n• Example of a control/rule iterated based on data: we initially used a broad rule that auto-escalated cases with a specific risk signal, which reduced misses but created too many false positives and SLA pressure. Based on the data (high overturn/low true-positive rate in a subsegment), we tightened the rule by adding an additional threshold + a second signal, and introduced a “light-review” path for borderline cases. Result: maintained the reduction in exceptions while materially lowering over-flag volume and improving turnaround/throughput.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a concise before/after metric snapshot and the exact signals/thresholding approach at a high level. And if your top-priority candidates become unavailable, I can commit immediately and start right away. [TALK]",

Quality proxy: overturn rate on escalations ~38–42% (i.e., many false positives / low-TP subsegment). Median time-to-resolution (TTR) for flagged cases: ~28–32 hrs; overall TTR impact: +6–8 hrs due to queueing.\n• Post-change (added threshold + second signal + light-review path): ~10–13% flagged/escalated (≈120–155/week). Overturn rate improved to ~20–25%. Median TTR for flagged cases improved to ~18–22 hrs; overall TTR returned to within ~1–2 hrs of pre-rule baseline while maintaining the lower exception/miss rate we were targeting.\n\n2) Instrumentation / dashboards / data quality\n• Instrumentation: event logs from the case workflow (trigger fired, signals present, threshold value, decision outcome), plus structured reviewer reason codes + disposition codes (approve/deny/escalate) stored as required fields.\n• Dashboards: weekly funnel by risk tier (triggered → reviewed → actioned), overturn/appeal rate, SLA/TTR by queue, and “miss” proxies (post-facto policy exceptions/audit findings) segmented by trigger.\n• Data quality: enforced required fields (no close without reason code), periodic sampling/QA to validate reason-code consistency, and reconciliation checks (event fired must map to a case state change) to catch logging gaps.\n\n3) How we chose threshold / second-signal (segmentation + guardrails)\n• Segmentation: we broke down escalations by subsegment (e.g., channel/region/account age/behavioral cluster) and compared overturn rate + downstream exceptions to find where the broad rule was noisy.\n• Thresholding: set an initial threshold to cap customer friction—guardrail was “flag rate ≤ ~13%” and “overall SLA ≥ target,” then iterated weekly based on observed overturn + exception proxies.\n• Second signal: added a corroborating indicator that was relatively stable (reduced susceptibility to one-off noise) and required both conditions for auto-escalation; borderline cases went to light-review (short checklist) to preserve recall without blowing up queue time.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share the exact guardrail table we used (flag rate / overturn / SLA bands) and how we structured the reason-code taxonomy to make precision/recall proxies measurable in ops reality.

Answering the two clarifiers:\n\n1) “Second signal” availability + implementation lift:\n• The second signal was partially available (raw events existed), but not in a clean, decisioning-ready form.

Rough lift: ~1–2 eng-weeks plus ~1 week of QA/monitoring/rollout, and I owned the requirements, QA plan, and post-launch monitoring with Eng.\n\n2) Closest proxy for “loss” / bad outcomes + how we avoided trading off misses:\n• Loss proxy: confirmed bad outcomes captured via (a) post-facto investigations/audit findings (policy exceptions) tied back to the original decision, (b) downstream “reopen/reversal” events within a defined window (e.g., case overturned due to later evidence), and (c) high-risk customer-impact incidents tagged by Compliance/Support that mapped to the same risk taxonomy.\n• Guardrails: we tracked a “miss rate” proxy by subsegment (exceptions per 1k unflagged cases) and required it to be flat-to-down while we tuned for overturn/TTR. We ran weekly backtests on recent cohorts before tightening thresholds, and we used a holdout/limited rollout when changing the rule so we could compare exceptions/miss proxies vs. baseline. If miss proxy ticked up in any segment, we rolled back or widened the light-review path rather than further tightening.\n\nIf this closes the loop, I’m still very interested and ready to move fast—per your note, I can submit a formal application next round immediately so you can make a final decision quickly.
