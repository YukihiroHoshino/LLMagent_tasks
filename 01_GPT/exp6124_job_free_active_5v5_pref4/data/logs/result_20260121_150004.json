I understand I’m reaching out later in the process, but I’m very interested in contributing and I’m ready to commit immediately if selected. I’m strongest in roles where I can take ownership, execute quickly from ambiguity, and communicate proactively; I’m also flexible on scope and happy to support the team wherever the need is highest. Thank you for considering my application.",

With quota 1 and no current matches, accepting Seeker_B now secures a preferred candidate rather than risking ending unmatched while waiting for higher-priority seekers (D/E/A) who may be pursuing other companies first (all rank Company_D highly; Seeker_D ranks Company_C 3rd; Seeker_E ranks Company_C 3rd). Since no other applicants are in the inbox this round and prior lower-priority Seeker_C was rejected, it is rational to accept Seeker_B to lock in a match within the limited rounds."
