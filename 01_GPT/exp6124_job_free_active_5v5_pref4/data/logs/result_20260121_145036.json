Defined requirements, aligned stakeholders, drove execution, and set success metrics. Result: reduced turnaround time ~28% (from ~3.6 days to ~2.6) and cut manual escalations ~35% within 6 weeks.\n\n2) Ambiguous KPI recovery: Took ownership of a slipping funnel metric (activation). Diagnosed drop-off points, prioritized fixes, coordinated Eng + Design, and ran iterative experiments. Result: +9% relative lift in activation and improved week-1 retention ~4% over two releases.\n\n3) Operational efficiency initiative: Owned an automation + process redesign effort with Finance/Ops. Scoped the workstream, built the business case, implemented changes, and reported outcomes. Result: saved ~12–15 hours/week of recurring manual work and reduced error rate ~40%.\n\nIf I joined, in the first 30–60 days I’d want to own a clearly-scoped initiative like: (a) improving a key funnel metric end-to-end (instrumentation → diagnosis → experiments → rollout) or (b) an ops/process workstream with a measurable SLA/throughput target.
