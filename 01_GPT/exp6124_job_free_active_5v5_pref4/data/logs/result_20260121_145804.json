I’m ready to move quickly, and I can demonstrate fit immediately via a short trial task/work sample and provide references. I’m adaptable on responsibilities and start date, and I’ll prioritize clear communication and strong ownership from day one. Thank you for considering my application. [APPLY]",

Since prior applications to higher-ranked companies were rejected and there are no other options, I should apply now and emphasize flexibility and willingness to prove fit quickly."

              "thought": "Seeker_B is 4th on our true priority list (D, E, A, B, C). We already rejected Seeker_C (our last choice), and we still have quota 1. However, higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) are likely to pursue their higher-ranked companies first (notably Company_D and Company_E), so they may not come to us. If we reject Seeker_B now, we risk ending unmatched. Given the round is already 4 and Seeker_B is an acceptable candidate on our list, accepting secures a match rather than waiting for uncertain outreach from higher-priority seekers."
