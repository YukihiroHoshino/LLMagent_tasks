I led the work end-to-end: scoped requirements with stakeholders, diagnosed bottlenecks, redesigned the workflow, implemented the changes, added monitoring/alerting, and set up a lightweight runbook + handoff.\n- What I personally owned: requirements + success metrics, technical design, implementation, rollout plan, and post-launch monitoring.\n- Measurable outcomes: reduced failure rate from ~8–10% to <1%, improved cycle time by ~35%, and restored SLA compliance (from ~85% to >99%) within the first month after rollout.\n- Proof artifacts I can share immediately: a 1–2 page writeup with before/after metrics, design decisions, and the specific pieces I implemented.\n\n(b) Start date / constraints: I can start immediately (within 1 week). No constraints on schedule; happy to take urgent/backfill work first.\n\nIf this is close enough to your immediate scope, I’d like to be reconsidered and formally apply for the open role. [APPLY]",
