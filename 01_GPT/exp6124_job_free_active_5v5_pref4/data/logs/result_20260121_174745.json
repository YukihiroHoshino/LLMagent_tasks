However, Company_D is the top choice for most seekers (including D and E), and Company_D’s top priority is Seeker_B, so Seeker_B may match elsewhere soon; Seeker_D prefers Company_D/Company_B over us, and Seeker_E also prefers Company_D/Company_E over us. Waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for Seeker_C (already rejected). Given Seeker_B is acceptable and applying now, accepting secures a match within our list."
