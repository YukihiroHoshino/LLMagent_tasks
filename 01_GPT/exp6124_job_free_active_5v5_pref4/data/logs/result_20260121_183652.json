Although Seeker_B ranks us #1 and applying now, we should consider that Seeker_A ranks us 4th (likely goes to D/A/B first), Seeker_D ranks us last, and Seeker_E ranks us 2nd (likely goes to D first). Company_D is top choice for most seekers and may absorb A/C/D/E, leaving B as a realistic strong option who will commit. However, accepting now could block a higher-priority Seeker_A/D/E if they later apply; yet given their preferences, the probability they come to us early is lower (especially Seeker_D). With only one message in inbox and round 1, we can afford to wait to pursue higher priorities; but we cannot initiate outreach—only respond. Rejecting Seeker_B risks losing our best available committed candidate if higher priorities never apply. Still, since Seeker_B has other high options but us #1, they may reapply later; but rules suggest they move on if rejected. Optimal is to accept Seeker_B now to secure a match rather than gamble on unlikely higher-priority applicants."
