Seeker_B has been consistently available, flexible, and ready to commit immediately, and we already positioned them as our #1 fallback with a clear trigger (“no engagement from D/E/A by end of next round”). Since this message is [TALK] and we still lack explicit confirmation D/E/A are unavailable, we should maintain consistency: acknowledge contact info, restate the trigger and timeline, and ask them to be ready to send [APPLY] immediately if/when we confirm no engagement. This preserves optionality for D/E/A while keeping B warm and aligned."
