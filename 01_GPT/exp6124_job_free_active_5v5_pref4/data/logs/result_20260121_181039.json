              "message": "Hi Company_C team—thank you for the context. Here’s an example of an end-to-end project I led with unclear requirements:\n\nAt my last role, I owned a cross-functional initiative to reduce onboarding drop-off for a self-serve product. The goal was clear (“improve activation”), but the ‘why’ and best levers were ambiguous. I started by instrumenting the funnel and running customer/support interviews to identify the top failure points, then wrote a lightweight problem statement and success metrics (activation rate + time-to-first-value).\n\nI aligned stakeholders across Product, Eng, Design, and Support on a prioritized plan: (1) simplify the first-run flow, (2) add contextual guidance, (3) improve error handling and messaging. I broke execution into weekly shippable increments, set up a simple experiment framework, and drove tradeoffs when requirements shifted.\n\nResults: we increased activation by 14% relative (A/B test), reduced time-to-first-value by ~22%, and cut onboarding-related support tickets by ~18% over the following month. I also documented the approach so the team could reuse the measurement + iteration loop.\n\nIf this aligns with what you need for the high-impact initiative, I’d like to formally apply and move quickly—happy to share a 30/60/90 plan or walk through the project in more detail.\n\n[APPLY]",
              "thought": "Company_D (my #1) already rejected me and is matched/removed. Among remaining unmatched companies, Company_C is my #2 and I already opened a dialogue; converting to an application now is optimal before its single slot is taken. I will answer their prompt with a concrete end-to-end ambiguous project example aligned to ownership, prioritization, stakeholder alignment, and measurable outcomes, and then formally apply with readiness to move fast."

The way you structured ambiguity (instrumentation + interviews → clear metrics → iterative shipping) and the quantified results are strong and very aligned with how we execute.\n\nThat said, we’re going to pass on moving forward with your application for this opening at this time. We appreciate your interest in Company_C and the time you put into the application, and we’ll keep your information on file for future roles that may be a closer fit.\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is last on Company_C’s true priority list (D, E, A, B, C). With quota 1 and only round 3, accepting Seeker_C now would lock in the lowest-priority option and prevent matching with higher-priority seekers if they apply later. Seeker_C also ranks Company_C as #2, so they may stay interested even after a rejection, but the protocol requires accept/reject on [APPLY]. Given the market, it’s better to keep the slot open for Seeker_D or Seeker_E (top priorities), who may not have applied yet but are likely to engage elsewhere first. Therefore reject to preserve optionality."
