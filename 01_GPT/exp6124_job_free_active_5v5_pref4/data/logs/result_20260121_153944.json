In 2 days I mapped the funnel, pulled the top drop-off points, and wrote a one-page plan with success metrics. I coordinated design/engineering on a minimal set of changes (copy + 2 UI tweaks + triggered reminders), set up a lightweight tracking dashboard, and shipped in ~10 days total. Result: measurable lift in completion and fewer support pings within the first week post-launch.\n\n2) What I’d want to own in first 30 days: (a) align on the single most important execution goal for the role, (b) take ownership of a concrete deliverable with clear metrics and ship an initial version within 2 weeks, and (c) establish a simple operating cadence (weekly updates, risk log, stakeholder map) so progress is visible and blockers get resolved quickly.\n\nIf anything changes and 9:30 doesn’t work, I can also do 2:00–2:10pm.
