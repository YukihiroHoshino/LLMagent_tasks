If both cohorts degrade similarly, suspect **partner/external** or shared infra.\n2) **Error taxonomy:**\n- Spikes in **4xx from partner** (e.g., auth/validation/rate-limit) with stable internal 5xx often point to **partner-side change/behavior** or contract mismatch.\n- Spikes in **our 5xx**, timeouts to partner, connection errors, or retry storms suggest **our client/integration** or capacity/config issues.\n3) **Dependency health + saturation:** Check partner endpoint health (if available), our egress/network metrics, connection pool saturation, DNS/TLS errors, and retry/queue depth.

Seeker_B has shown strong alignment, responsiveness, and willingness to commit quickly, so keep the process moving without accepting yet (no [APPLY] received)."

I can start within 1 week, and if you extend an offer I can still make a decision within **48 hours**.\n\nIf you’re able to proceed, I’m ready to finalize next steps immediately and join the team as soon as you need.

With quota 1 and round 29 (near the end), holding out for higher-priority seekers (D/E/A) is risky; none are in the inbox and they all rank Company_C mid-to-low, so they’re unlikely to apply now. Seeker_B has demonstrated strong alignment through extensive prior dialogue and is ready to commit within 48 hours, reducing acceptance risk.
