Start date Monday, [DATE] (or earlier if needed) is confirmed, and we’ll reach out to [REFERENCE NAME] during [WINDOW] to complete the final step.\n\nWelcome aboard—please reply confirming you accept so we can proceed with paperwork and onboarding details. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We are Company_C with quota 1 and must maximize match quality per our true priority list: D > E > A > B > C. In this round, only Seeker_B applied. Our previous higher-priority candidate has delayed again, and we explicitly triggered the backup-close and told Seeker_B to apply now for a same-round final decision. Rejecting again risks ending unmatched or forcing a later, worse outcome; there is no evidence Seeker_D/Seeker_E/Seeker_A will apply to us (they all rank Company_C low/moderate and likely matched elsewhere), and we have no other applicants now. Seeker_B is on our list (rank 4) and has provided strong fit signals, a work sample, and an immediately reachable reference, enabling fast close. Therefore accept now to secure a match rather than remain unfilled."
