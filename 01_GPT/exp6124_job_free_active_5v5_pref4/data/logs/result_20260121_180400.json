Sharing 3 concrete examples aligned to delivery ownership, stakeholder management, and operating cadence:\n\n1) Ambiguous delivery ownership: I led a cross-functional rollout of a new internal workflow tool where the problem statement was “reduce cycle time” but requirements were unclear. I ran discovery with ops + eng, translated pain points into measurable goals, wrote a phased PRD, and sequenced work into 2-week milestones with explicit risks/assumptions. When a key dependency slipped, I re-scoped to a smaller MVP that still delivered the core metric improvement, then iterated post-launch.\n\n2) Stakeholder management + crisp comms: On a project spanning product, engineering, and a revenue-facing team, priorities changed weekly and stakeholders had conflicting success metrics. I set up a single source-of-truth status doc (scope, decisions, RAID log), instituted a weekly exec update with “what changed / what’s blocked / decisions needed,” and proactively surfaced tradeoffs (time vs. quality vs. scope) to force timely calls. This reduced churn and kept delivery predictable despite shifting inputs.\n\n3) Operating cadence / unblocking: For an ongoing portfolio of small-to-mid initiatives, I implemented a lightweight planning cadence (intake → sizing → prioritization → weekly commitment) and a daily unblock loop with clear owners. I tracked WIP limits, flagged bottlenecks early, and used short retros to adjust process. Result was fewer stalled items and faster throughput without increasing headcount.\n\nEarliest start date: I can start immediately (or within 1 week if you need a specific onboarding window).\n\nIf your higher-priority paths don’t come through, I’m ready to commit quickly and can align to whichever of these gaps is most urgent for you right now.",

After the MVP launch and 2 iterations, median cycle time moved to ~6–7 business days (roughly a ~25–35% improvement) within ~6 weeks of launch; by ~10–12 weeks we were sustaining ~5–6 business days for the common request types, with the long-tail reduced via clearer routing + ownership.\n\n2) First 30 days (stand up rhythm without heavy process):\n- Week 1: Listen + map the system. Meet key stakeholders (eng/product/ops), capture current intake paths, pain points, and decision makers. Create a lightweight single source of truth (one page) with: goals, current work, owners, and top risks.\n- Week 2: Implement “minimum viable” intake + prioritization. Define a simple intake template (problem, impact, urgency, owner, dependency). Start a weekly 30-min prioritization with a small decision group; limit WIP and explicitly park lower-priority items.\n- Week 3: Add execution cadence + RAID. Establish a weekly status update (async doc + 15-min live) focused only on: what changed, what’s blocked, decisions needed. Maintain a tight RAID log (top 5–10 items) and drive closures.\n- Week 4: Calibrate + trim overhead. Retrospect what’s working, remove any meetings/docs not pulling weight, and lock in a repeatable cadence. Deliver at least one quick win (unblock a dependency, ship a small but visible improvement) to build trust.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share the exact templates I’ve used for intake and RAID to keep it lightweight.
