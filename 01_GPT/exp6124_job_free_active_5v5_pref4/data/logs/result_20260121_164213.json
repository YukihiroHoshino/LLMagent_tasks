I’ve also used Confluence/Notion for the written launch brief + links to the live plan.\n- Preventing manual upkeep: (a) keep one source of truth (Jira/Asana) and have the dashboard pull from it via fields/tags (Launch ID, milestone, DRI, due date, status), (b) automate rollups where possible (Jira filters, saved views, scheduled exports, Looker connectors), (c) minimize custom fields and enforce a small required set, and (d) make updating part of the cadence (async update requirement + meeting starts from the dashboard, so it stays current because people rely on it).\n\nIf these align with your context, I’m ready to move back into active consideration immediately and can start within a week (or sooner if needed).\n\n[TALK]",
