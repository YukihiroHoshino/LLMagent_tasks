We already rejected Seeker_C; no other inbound this round besides Seeker_B. Given Seeker_D ranks Company_C 3rd and Seeker_E ranks Company_C 3rd, they may still come to us after trying Company_D/Company_E first; Company_D and Company_E also value them, so competition is real. Still, with rounds remaining, it’s better to preserve the slot for higher-priority candidates rather than lock in Seeker_B now."

Waiting could allow a higher-priority seeker (D/E/A) to apply later, but there is no guarantee they will engage us given their preferences (D and E both rank Company_C 3rd; A and B rank Company_C last). Seeker_B has now applied twice, signaling strong willingness to commit, which reduces risk of ending unmatched.
