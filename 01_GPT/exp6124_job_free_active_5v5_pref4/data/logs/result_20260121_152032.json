Outcome: shipped on schedule and improved a core funnel KPI by ~18% over the following quarter.\n\n2) Operational ownership + metrics: Took ownership of a recurring workflow that was causing delays; instrumented metrics, identified bottlenecks, and drove process + tooling changes with stakeholders. Outcome: reduced cycle time by ~25% and cut escalations by ~30%.\n\n3) Stakeholder communication + execution: Managed a multi-team rollout with competing priorities; set a clear plan, ran weekly updates, and unblocked dependencies. Outcome: delivered the rollout with minimal disruption and improved adoption to ~70% within 6 weeks.\n\nI’m ready to move quickly—happy to share deeper write-ups, references, or walk through any of these in an interview.

A few examples of impact from my recent work:\n- Led a cross-functional initiative from discovery → build → launch; shipped on schedule and improved a core funnel KPI by ~18% over the following quarter.\n- Took ownership of an operational workflow, added instrumentation, and drove process/tooling changes; reduced cycle time by ~25% and cut escalations by ~30%.\n- Managed a multi-team rollout with complex dependencies; delivered with minimal disruption and increased adoption to ~70% within 6 weeks.\n\nI’m ready to move quickly—happy to share deeper write-ups or walk through any project in an interview.
