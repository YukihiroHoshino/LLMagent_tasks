I’d define it as the smallest action that correlates strongly with retention.\n\nWeek-1 Drop-off Rate (D7):\n- Denominator: same as above (new users with first session).\n- Numerator: # of those users with NO sessions (or no key activity) in days 1–7 after first session.\n- (Optional) Also track “Early Abandonment”: no second session within 24–48 hours.\n\nTime-to-First-Value (TTFV):\n- Median (and p75) time from first session timestamp → activation event timestamp among activated users.\n\nSegmentation (kept minimal at first to avoid overfitting):\n- Acquisition channel (paid/organic/partner), persona/plan tier (if known), device/platform, geo/timezone, and “integration required vs not.”\n- Also segment by first-session path (which step was last completed) to pinpoint the biggest drop-off node.\n\n3) Week-1 dependencies/risks + how I’d unblock\nData quality/instrumentation risk:\n- Unblock: day-1 event audit for the first-session funnel + activation event; define event schema + QA checklist; create a simple dashboard with sanity checks (volume, duplicates, missingness).\n\nEngineering bandwidth risk:\n- Unblock: propose a two-track plan: (a) low-eng fixes (copy/UX tweaks, reordering steps, defaults) + (b) 1–2 targeted eng items tied to top drop-off/error points; keep Iteration #1 intentionally small.\n\nDecision ownership / scope creep:\n- Unblock: identify a single DRI for activation metric + a weekly 30-min decision slot; publish a one-page brief with explicit non-scope and decision points.\n\nIf helpful, I can also propose a concrete “activation event” candidate set (2–3 options) and a quick method to validate which best predicts week-4 retention using historical cohorts.",
