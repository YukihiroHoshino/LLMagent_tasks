To make this low-risk, I can propose a clear 30/60/90-day plan (or even a short initial trial project) focused on shipping measurable outcomes quickly, tightening operational cadence, and communicating crisply across functions.\n\nIf there’s a specific concern that kept me from moving forward before, I’m ready to address it directly.
