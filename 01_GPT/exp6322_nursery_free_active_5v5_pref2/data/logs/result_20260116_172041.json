With quota 1 and only round 1, it is strategically better to keep the seat available for higher-priority parents who are likely to apply later: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and could come if not accepted by E; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D); Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last so are unlikely, but Parent_B is our top and plausible.
