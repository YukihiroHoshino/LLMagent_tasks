We can also complete any paperwork, deposit, and onboarding requirements the same day, and we remain fully flexible on start date.\n\nIf you are still holding the place pending higher-priority families, could you please let me know whether there is a likely decision point (or whether you are effectively maintaining a waitlist)? I want to be fully responsive if the place becomes available.\n\nWith thanks,\nParent_E",

I have already applied multiple times and been rejected because they are holding the spot for higher-priority families. Since I can’t target any other nursery this round, I will submit another formal application while adding a concrete commitment (immediate acceptance, paperwork/deposit same day) and a respectful request for a clear decision timeline or waitlist status, which may help them finalize if higher-priority options have not materialized."

If you are still seeking a place after the next round, please submit one more [APPLY] (or check in), and if the place is still unfilled at that point, we will reassess immediately and make a definitive decision based on the applicants on hand.\n\nWith thanks,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_C’s true priority list (behind Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). With quota 1, accepting Parent_E now could block a higher-priority parent if they later apply. Given repeated applications from Parent_E and no evidence that higher-priority parents have been matched elsewhere, it remains optimal to hold the seat. Therefore reject again while giving a clear decision point to reduce churn and maintain goodwill."

However, by round 7, no higher-priority parents (B/A/D) have approached Nursery_C; they each have stronger preferences elsewhere (B: E then C; C: D then C; A: E then B; D: E then A), and it is plausible they will match without applying to us. Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched by round 30. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is ready to commit immediately, reducing execution risk. Given the stated “final decision point” and no competing higher-priority applicants on hand, accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than gamble on a late higher-priority application."
