We’re not able to commit sooner at this moment. Our plan remains to reassess at the start of round 8; if we still have not received and confirmed an application from a higher-priority family by then, we will consider the next family on our list immediately. If you are still unplaced in round 8, please send an [APPLY] and we will review right away based on availability.",

It is only round 6, and higher-priority parents may still apply: Parent_B ranks us #2, Parent_C ranks us #2, while Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last. Given our objective to match as high as possible, we should continue to hold the seat at least through the reassessment window (round 7–8) rather than commit to Parent_E now. Parent_E is only talking, not applying, so we respond with [TALK] and maintain the timeline without revealing unnecessary specifics."

Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after D). So the most realistic higher-priority candidate who might still come is Parent_B (or possibly Parent_C, though they are lower than E on my list). However, continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched if Parent_B never applies. Parent_E has consistently demonstrated strong commitment (Nursery_C is their 1st choice) and will accept immediately, securing a match now. Given we already delayed until round 8 as stated, and there is still no higher-priority application, accepting Parent_E now maximizes certainty while still staying within my acceptable list."
