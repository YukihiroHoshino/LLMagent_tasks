Given that our place remains unfilled and in light of the current round, we would like to offer you the place at Nursery_C.\n\nPlease confirm that you accept the offer, and we will proceed with the onboarding steps and agree a start date.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched. My true priority list ranks Parent_E 4th (above Parent_C only). Higher-priority parents are Parent_B (1st), Parent_A (2nd), Parent_D (3rd). Given parents' preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. Thus the only realistic higher-priority threat is Parent_B (and to a lesser extent Parent_C, but they are lower priority than Parent_E). I have repeatedly rejected Parent_E to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates, but by round 16 no higher-priority parent has approached me, while Parent_E continues to apply and would accept immediately. Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match with a parent on my list and avoids leaving capacity unused; the upside of waiting for Parent_B is increasingly uncertain. Therefore accept Parent_E."
