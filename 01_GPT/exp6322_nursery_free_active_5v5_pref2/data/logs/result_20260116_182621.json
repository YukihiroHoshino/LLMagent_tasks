Parent_E is repeatedly applying, but accepting them now could block a higher-priority parent if they apply later. Given the environment allows continued rounds up to 30 and higher-priority parents may still approach Nursery_C (notably Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd but is lowest on our list; Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last), we should continue to hold capacity for higher-priority candidates. Also, consistent prior responses to Parent_E have been rejections based on priority order; changing to accept without new information would be inconsistent with stated policy. Therefore reject again."

We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, so the only reason to keep rejecting is the possibility that a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_B, who ranks Nursery_C 2nd; or Parent_C who ranks Nursery_C 2nd but is not on our list; Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last; Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last) may yet apply. Given the very late round (26/30), the repeated rejections already issued, and the low likelihood that Parent_B will switch from their higher choices (Nursery_E first) this late, the risk of ending unmatched outweighs the benefit of holding out. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) parent rather than risking an unfilled seat."
