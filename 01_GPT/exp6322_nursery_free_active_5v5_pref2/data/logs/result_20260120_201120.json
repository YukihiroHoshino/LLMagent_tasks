Nursery_E is highly demanded (top choice for A, B, D) and will likely fill quickly, which could push Parent_B to apply to Nursery_C in later rounds if rejected by Nursery_E.

              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on our true priority list (B, A, D, E, C). We have repeatedly rejected Parent_E to keep capacity for higher-priority families. In the broader market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd, Parent_C ranks it 2nd, while Parent_A and Parent_D rank it last—so the most plausible higher-priority arrival is Parent_B (our top choice) if they fail at Nursery_E, or Parent_A if displaced, though A is unlikely to target us. Given we are only at round 14 and previously communicated reassessment around rounds 18–20, accepting Parent_E now risks losing the chance to match with Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D) later, which is our objective. Parent_E is currently only [TALK], so we should maintain stance, confirm timeline, and answer the yes/no about formal higher-priority applications without overcommitting; we can state that no higher-priority formal applications have been received since round 12 (consistent with our unmatched status and prior messages), while still noting they could apply later."
