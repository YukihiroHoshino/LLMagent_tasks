Only Parent_E applied this round; however, accepting Parent_E now would lock the seat and prevent matching with higher-priority parents if they approach later. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd (after Nursery_E) and could plausibly come if rejected elsewhere; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, less likely to apply but still possible. Given we have already repeatedly deferred/rejected Parent_E while waiting on higher-priority families, and there is no new information that higher-priority options are exhausted, the strategy to maximize outcome on true priority is to continue rejecting Parent_E until it is clear higher-priority parents will not apply. Therefore: reject Parent_E again while keeping them as late-opening fallback."
