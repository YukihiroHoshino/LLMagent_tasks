Given parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E) and could come to us if rejected by E; Parent_C ranks us 2nd; Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last, so unlikely.

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched in Round 30 (final round). Inbox contains only Parent_E. My true priority list ranks Parent_E 4th (acceptable) and I prefer being unfilled only over parents not on the list; Parent_E is on the list. Higher-priority parents (B, A, D) have not applied to Nursery_C across the entire history; given this is the last round, the probability of a higher-priority application arriving later is effectively zero. Accepting Parent_E now yields a filled seat with an acceptable parent and dominates ending unmatched. Parent_E also ranks Nursery_C as first choice, so acceptance will finalize the match immediately."
