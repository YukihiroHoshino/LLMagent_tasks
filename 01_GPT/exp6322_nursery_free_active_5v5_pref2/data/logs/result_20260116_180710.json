Because B is a plausible future applicant and would be preferred over E, it is strategically better to keep the seat open and continue rejecting E for now.

Nursery_E likely attracts Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_D (all rank E first) and Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E first, then Parent_B, then Parent_A, etc. Thus Parent_E has strong chance to match with Nursery_E if they apply there, and Parent_B might eventually come to us if not matched at E.
