Given the market, Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_E first (their 1st), but could come to us if rejected; Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E then Parent_B, so B might still get E and never reach us, but it’s not certain. Since we still have time (round 6/30) and we explicitly prefer waiting for higher-priority families, we should continue rejecting Parent_E’s apply this round to preserve the chance of a higher-priority match. We can give a clearer timeline signal without committing."
