We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but accepting Parent_E now would block a higher-priority match if any of the top three later applies. Parent_E is persistently interested (Nursery_C is their 1st choice), so keeping them warm as a fallback is valuable. Since their current tag is [TALK], we should not commit; we should provide a firm deadline and a clear checklist to enable an immediate offer if released, while maintaining the hold for higher-priority families."

However, Parent_E is 4th on our list and, importantly, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C as their 1st choice, so if we accept we lock a guaranteed match now. Waiting for higher-priority parents (B/A/D) has yielded no applications to us through Round 16; given the long hold already and no evidence they will apply to Nursery_C (they each prefer Nursery_E first; B also has Nursery_C as 2nd but has not approached), the expected benefit of further delay is low while the cost is risking ending unmatched. Therefore accept Parent_E to fill the seat and conclude the match."
