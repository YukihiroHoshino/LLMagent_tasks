Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and could plausibly apply if rejected/unsuccessful at E; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D); Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. Since Parent_B is my top choice and has relatively high interest in me, it's strategically better to keep the seat open rather than lock in with Parent_E at this stage (round 6 of up to 30). Parent_E has applied repeatedly and would accept immediately, but that does not outweigh the option value of waiting for Parent_B. Therefore, I should reject Parent_E again while leaving the door open for future reassessment."

Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched, so the key is to avoid locking in a lower-priority parent too early if there is a reasonable chance a higher-priority parent will apply in upcoming rounds. Given the global preference lists: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C as 1st, while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. Nursery_C’s top choice Parent_B is plausibly still in play for Nursery_C (since Nursery_E is Parent_B’s 1st, but Nursery_E’s top priority is Parent_E, so Nursery_E may accept Parent_E and reject Parent_B, pushing Parent_B to Nursery_C). Therefore, accepting Parent_E now risks missing Parent_B. History shows Parent_E repeatedly applies; we can likely retain Parent_E as a fallback. Thus, reject again to preserve the seat for a higher-priority applicant, while maintaining a courteous, waitlist-like stance."
