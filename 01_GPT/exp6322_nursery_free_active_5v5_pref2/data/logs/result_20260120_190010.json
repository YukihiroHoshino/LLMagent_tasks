Given the market: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and Nursery_E ranks Parent_B 2nd, so Parent_B may go to Nursery_E; Parent_A ranks us last, unlikely to apply; Parent_D ranks us last, unlikely to apply. Still, with only round 1 information, optimal strategy is to hold the seat for a better-ranked parent if possible.
