              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and true priority order: Parent_B > Parent_A > Parent_D > Parent_E > Parent_C. Parent_E is acceptable but only 4th. Given we still have no match, the key question is whether higher-priority parents are likely to apply. From preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. So the main threat is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_C, though lower priority than E). Nursery_E is top choice for Parent_B and also highly demanded; Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E first and Parent_B second, so Parent_B may be competing there and could later turn to Nursery_C. Therefore, accepting Parent_E now risks blocking a higher-priority Parent_B later. With rounds remaining (up to 30), it is still rational to continue holding the seat for Parent_B. Thus reject Parent_E again while keeping door open if higher-priority options are exhausted."

              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_C’s true priority list (behind Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Parent_E strongly prefers Nursery_C (ranked 1st), but accepting them now would forgo the chance to match with higher-priority parents if they apply later. Given full market info, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd, while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last; so the most realistic higher-priority candidate who might still come is Parent_B (our top priority) and possibly Parent_A/Parent_D are unlikely. However, without any message from Parent_B this round and given we are already at round 25 with repeated re-applications from Parent_E and no evidence of higher-priority engagement, the risk of ending unmatched is increasing. Since Parent_E is within our acceptable list and provides immediate commitment, accepting now secures a match rather than continuing to hold indefinitely."
