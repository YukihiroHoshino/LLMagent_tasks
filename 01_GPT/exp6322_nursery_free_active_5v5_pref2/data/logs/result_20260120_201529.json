Thank you for continuing to keep me in consideration.\n\nCould you please share a brief status update this round: are you still awaiting confirmations from higher-priority families, or are you now in a position to move to the next candidate for the remaining place?\n\nIf you are able to extend an offer to me at any point, I can confirm acceptance within 30 minutes and complete all enrollment steps (documents and any deposit) the same day. For quick reference: start date is immediate (or any date in the next 1–4 weeks), and I prefer full-time Mon–Fri but can adapt to your available hours.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Given repeated rejections due to higher-priority families, the best strategy is to stay active while minimizing annoyance: send a concise [TALK] message that re-confirms immediate acceptance and asks for a concrete status update on whether they are still awaiting confirmations or are now ready to move to the next candidate. This preserves my position as the fastest standby option without wasting an [APPLY] if they are still blocked by higher-priority outcomes."

If you would like to remain active, you’re welcome to check back next round (and submit an [APPLY] then).

No other parents are in the inbox this round, but given the overall market info, higher-priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) may still approach later; accepting Parent_E now would risk locking in a worse outcome. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], I should keep them warm without committing, and provide a status update consistent with prior messages (still awaiting higher-priority outcomes; review each round; can’t share exact deadlines)."

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. My true priority list ranks Parent_E fourth (behind Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). Parent_E ranks Nursery_C first and would accept immediately, but accepting now could block a higher-priority parent if they apply later. Given we are at round 25/30 and no higher-priority parents are currently in my inbox, the key tradeoff is risk of ending unmatched vs securing a lower-ranked but certain match. Parent_B (my top) has Nursery_C as 2nd choice and likely is pursuing Nursery_E first; Parent_A has Nursery_C last; Parent_D has Nursery_C last—so the chance of them coming to me late is uncertain but possible. Still, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of ending unmatched is increasing. Parent_E is on my acceptable list, strongly committed, and can finalize immediately, so I should accept to lock in a match rather than gamble on higher-priority candidates who may never apply."
