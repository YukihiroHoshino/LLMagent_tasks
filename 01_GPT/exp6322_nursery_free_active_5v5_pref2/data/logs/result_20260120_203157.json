Parent_B ranks us 2nd and may apply after Nursery_E; Parent_A ranks us last (unlikely to apply); Parent_D ranks us last (unlikely); Parent_C ranks us 2nd and may apply after Nursery_D. With only one slot, it is worth holding for a higher-priority candidate rather than locking in Parent_E in round 1.

Check parents' preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_A ranks us last, Parent_D ranks us last, Parent_C ranks us 2nd but we rank Parent_C last. So the main risk is Parent_B potentially coming to us if they fail at Nursery_E. With many rounds remaining (17/30) and no other applicants in inbox this round besides Parent_E, best strategy to maximize priority is to continue holding for Parent_B (and possibly Parent_A/Parent_D though unlikely).

Higher-priority candidates B/A/D do not rank Nursery_C first; B is the main threat since C is their 2nd choice and Nursery_E may reject them due to prioritizing E then B (actually E ranks B 2nd, so B could be accepted by E). Parent_A ranks C last, Parent_D ranks C last, so they are very unlikely to apply. By Round 20, no higher-priority family has applied despite many rounds, making it increasingly unlikely they will. With quota 1 and the risk of ending unmatched if I keep waiting, accepting Parent_E now secures a match with a parent who values us most, and forecloses only a low-probability late application from Parent_B.
