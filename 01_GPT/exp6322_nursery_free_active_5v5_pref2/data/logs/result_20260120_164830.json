Check Parent_B’s preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A last, so it is very unlikely Parent_B will apply to us unless rejected by all others, which is unlikely given other nurseries’ priorities.

              "message": "Dear Parent_E,\n\nThank you for your continued patience and for formally confirming your application.\n\nGiven the current stage of the allocation and your confirmed readiness to enroll immediately, we are able to offer you the remaining place at Nursery_C. Please reply by email today to confirm acceptance, and we will send the final enrollment confirmation and any remaining administrative steps.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions",
              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Our true priority list is Parent_B > Parent_A > Parent_D > Parent_E > Parent_C, so Parent_E is acceptable but only 4th. However, it is round 30 (final round), and no higher-priority parents have contacted/applied to us in this round or earlier. Waiting yields a likely unmatched outcome, which is worse than filling with an acceptable parent. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C as their 1st choice and can accept immediately, making the match stable for us at this point. Therefore, accept Parent_E now to secure a match within our priority list."
