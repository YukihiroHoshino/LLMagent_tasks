If we remain unfilled as we approach the final rounds (around rounds 28–30), we will make a final decision based on who is still available then.

We still have quota 1 and no other applicants in this round’s inbox besides Parent_E, but higher-priority parents (especially Parent_B and Parent_A) could still approach us late; Parent_B ranks us 2nd and Parent_C ranks us 2nd, while Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last, making them less likely but still possible if they fail elsewhere. Accepting Parent_E now would lock in a lower-than-ideal match and forgo any chance of matching with Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D. With rounds 26–30 remaining, it is still rational to hold the seat for higher-priority families. Therefore, reject Parent_E again while giving clear timing: we will only move to them if higher-priority families do not materialize by the final rounds."
