If our place becomes available (for example, if another family declines or circumstances change), we review active candidates at that time according to our placement priorities and current availability.\n\nA realistic pathway to be considered is:\n- Keep your application “active” by checking in periodically (as you’ve done), and\n- If we contact you about a potential opening, be ready to confirm quickly and provide any required documents (ID/registration details, schedule/start-date confirmation, and any standard enrollment forms).\n\nYou do not need to submit repeated formal applications every round unless we specifically ask you to. If anything changes for your family (start date flexibility, schedule needs), feel free to share it, as it can help us assess feasibility quickly if an opening arises.\n\nThank you again, and we appreciate your patience.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

Nursery_E is top choice for many and may take Parent_B (Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_B #2), but Parent_B could be displaced or choose Nursery_C if Nursery_E fills with Parent_E or others. Since we are at round 10 of 30, we have time to wait for a better match; we also previously rejected Parent_E multiple times consistent with our priorities.
