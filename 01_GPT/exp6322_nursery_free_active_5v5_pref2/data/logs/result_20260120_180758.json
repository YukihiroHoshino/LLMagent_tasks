Among current applicants, Parent_B is higher priority than Parent_A, and Parent_B also ranks Nursery_E as first choice, so accepting Parent_A now would block a better feasible match. Parent_E (my top choice) is not in my inbox and ranks Nursery_E last, so unlikely to apply. Best strategy is to accept Parent_B (handled separately) and reject Parent_A to preserve the slot for a higher-priority parent."

Although Parent_E is my top choice, Parent_E does not rank Nursery_E highly (last) and is likely to apply to Nursery_C first, so waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower-priority parent later. Accepting Parent_B now secures a high-priority match within quota and removes uncertainty. Parent_A was already rejected; Parent_D is lower priority than Parent_B."

Likely proposals: Parent_E has already applied to us as first choice; Parent_B may go to Nursery_E first; Parent_C may go to Nursery_D first; Parent_A to Nursery_E; Parent_D to Nursery_E. This suggests we may not receive higher-priority applicants soon, but rejecting Parent_E risks ending up with only Parent_C or unfilled. However, holding out could still yield Parent_B if Nursery_E fills with Parent_E and rejects Parent_B. Yet if we accept Parent_E now, we lock a decent (4th) option and avoid vacancy risk. With only one message in inbox and early-round uncertainty, I choose to accept Parent_E to secure a match rather than gamble for Parent_B/A/D who may never apply."

Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_D only 3rd (behind Nursery_E and Nursery_B) and may never apply.
