Although Parent_A is ranked higher by us, Parent_A’s preferences place Nursery_D as their 3rd choice (after Nursery_E and Nursery_B), so they are unlikely to apply to us early and may match elsewhere.

Parent_E (my top choice) has not contacted me and in their preferences Nursery_E is last, so it is unlikely they will apply later unless rejected everywhere else; waiting risks losing a strong, high-priority match.
