There isn’t a missing document or a timing issue on your side—our decisions are based on our priority order and the pool of families engaging with us in each round.\n\nIf you would like to be actively considered in the current round, please feel free to submit a formal application again with an [APPLY] message. If a place cannot be offered, it would be due to higher-priority applicants being considered for our single available place, rather than any specific eligibility detail you have not provided.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and no match yet. My true priority is B > A > D > E > C, so Parent_E is 4th choice—acceptable but not ideal. Parent_E is only [TALK] this round; I cannot accept without an [APPLY]. Given Parent_E ranks Nursery_C first and is persistent, they are a reliable fallback. However, Parent_B (my top) ranks me 2nd after Nursery_E; Parent_C ranks me 2nd after Nursery_D; Parent_A and Parent_D rank me last. I should keep the seat open and encourage Parent_E to apply again only if they want to be considered, without committing, while I wait for higher-priority parents to potentially apply in upcoming rounds."

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and no current match. True priority list ranks Parent_E 4th (below Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). In this round, only Parent_E applied to Nursery_C, so accepting would fill the seat but risks missing a higher-priority parent in later rounds. However, by round 7, higher-priority parents (B/A/D) all rank Nursery_C as 2nd/5th/5th respectively and are likely pursuing their higher choices (notably Nursery_E and Nursery_D) and may never apply here. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st and has repeatedly applied, indicating strong commitment and high likelihood of immediate match. With no competing applicants now and uncertainty that higher-priority parents will approach later, it is optimal to secure a match now rather than remain unfilled."
