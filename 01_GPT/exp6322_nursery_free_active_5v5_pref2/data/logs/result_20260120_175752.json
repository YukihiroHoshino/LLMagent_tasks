This means the main realistic higher-priority threat is Parent_B (and to a lesser extent Parent_C, though Parent_C is below Parent_E in my priority). Nursery_E is Parent_B’s top choice and also ranks Parent_B highly (2nd), so Parent_B may match with Nursery_E and never come to me; however, that is not guaranteed, so I should not commit to Parent_E yet.
