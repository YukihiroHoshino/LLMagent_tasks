After reviewing this round’s applications in line with our admissions priority order, we’re not able to offer you the place at this time, so we must decline your application. If the place remains unfilled after considering any higher-priority applicants who come forward in later rounds, you’re welcome to apply again for reconsideration. Thank you for your patience and understanding.",

We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but accepting Parent_E now would prevent us from matching with any higher-priority parent should they apply in the remaining rounds. Given Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D all rank Nursery_C reasonably (B ranks us 2nd; C ranks us 2nd but is lowest in our priority; others rank us last), there is still a non-zero chance a higher-priority parent could approach us late. Consistent with our prior stance and priority-based admissions, we continue to hold the seat for higher-priority applicants and reject Parent_E this round."
