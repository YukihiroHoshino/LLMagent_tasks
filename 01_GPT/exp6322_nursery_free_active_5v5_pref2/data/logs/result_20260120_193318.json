Parent_E has shown very strong commitment and fit, but accepting now would forgo the possibility of matching with higher-priority parents if they later apply. Given Parent_B has Nursery_C as 2nd choice (after Nursery_E) and Parent_C has Nursery_C as 2nd (but is lowest priority for us), there remains a realistic chance that a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_B or Parent_A) could approach later.

Our quota is 1 and we remain unmatched, so accepting Parent_E now could block a higher-priority parent if they approach later. In this round, only Parent_E contacted us, and they are engaging via [TALK], not [APPLY], so no immediate accept/reject decision is required. Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. Our top targets (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) may or may not come; Parent_A and Parent_D are unlikely to apply to us soon since we are their last choice. Parent_B is plausible if they miss Nursery_E; thus we should keep Parent_E warm but avoid committing. Best action: continue [TALK], set a clear near-term decision point, and (optionally) invite a formal application if/when we are ready, without promising. This preserves flexibility while maintaining Parent_E’s interest."
