However, higher-priority parents (especially Parent_B, who ranks Nursery_C 2nd, and Parent_C, who ranks it 2nd as well though lower on our list) may still apply later if rejected elsewhere; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so less likely. Accepting Parent_E now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose a possible higher-priority match. With rounds remaining (24/30) and no cost specified for staying unmatched, optimal strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue rejecting Parent_E and keep the seat open for Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D. History indicates Parent_E will keep applying, so we can still accept later if no higher-priority family appears near the end."
