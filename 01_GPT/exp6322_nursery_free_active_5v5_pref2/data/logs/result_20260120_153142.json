In round 1, Parent_E is only initiating [TALK], not applying, so no immediate commitment is required. Given Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd and Parent_C ranks us 2nd, higher-priority candidates may apply soon; we should keep the seat open while remaining engaged with Parent_E and encourage an application if they are ready, without promising acceptance."

In round 1, no other applicants are in the inbox, and waiting to try for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_D only 3rd (behind E and B) and may match elsewhere.
