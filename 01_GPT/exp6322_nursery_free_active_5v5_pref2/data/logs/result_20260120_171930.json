If offered a place, I can confirm acceptance immediately and complete all enrollment steps right away (paperwork/deposit/orientation).

Although I have been repeatedly rejected due to their internal priority order, the only way to possibly secure a match is to submit a formal application again in case no higher-priority family applies this round. I will keep the message concise, confirm immediate acceptance, and reiterate flexibility."

              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on our true priority list (B, A, D, E, C). We still have an unfilled seat and should only accept E if we believe higher-priority parents (B/A/D) are unlikely to apply to us in remaining rounds. Given all parents' preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_C ranks C 2nd (after D), Parent_A ranks C last, Parent_D ranks C last. So the main threat is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_C, though C is lowest on our list). Nursery_E likely takes Parent_B (E ranks B as #2 and may accept B if E's #1 Parent_E is still pursuing us). Parent_C likely targets Nursery_D first. With round 26 and repeated lack of any applications from B/A/D to us, probability of receiving a higher-priority applicant seems low. Accepting Parent_E now secures a reasonably high-ranked match (4/5) versus risking being unmatched by round 30."
