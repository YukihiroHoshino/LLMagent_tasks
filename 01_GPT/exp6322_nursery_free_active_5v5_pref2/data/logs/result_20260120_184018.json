If you are able to extend an offer at any point today, I can **accept within 1 hour (same day)** and complete **deposit/paperwork immediately**. I remain fully flexible on start date (can start as soon as you can onboard, or anytime in the next 2–6 weeks) and have no schedule constraints.\n\nIf you are in a position to move down the list by the end of round 30, please contact me on short notice—I will respond immediately.\n\nThank you again for considering me.",

Nursery_C explicitly suggested sending a fresh [APPLY] at the start of round 30 to be best positioned if they move down the list by the end of the simulation.

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched at the final round (30). Inbox contains only Parent_E. Nursery_C’s true priority list ranks Parent_E 4th (acceptable). Higher-priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) have not applied to Nursery_C throughout the history; given the simulation ends now, waiting yields an unfilled seat, which is worse than matching with an acceptable parent. Parent_E strongly prefers Nursery_C (ranked #1) and can confirm immediately, so acceptance secures a match with an acceptable candidate and avoids ending unmatched."
