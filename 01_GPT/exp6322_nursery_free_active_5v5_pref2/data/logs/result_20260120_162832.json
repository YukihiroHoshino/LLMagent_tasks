Since the protocol requires ACCEPT/REJECT on an APPLY and we cannot hold/waitlist, the best strategy to maximize expected priority is to reject Parent_E now and keep capacity open for higher-priority parents, especially Parent_B who is likely to apply after Nursery_E.

Nursery_E will likely attract Parent_E and Parent_B strongly; Nursery_D will likely attract Parent_C; Nursery_A/B will attract others.

At this stage, our allocation decision is driven primarily by our internal priority order and the set of applications we may still receive from families ranked ahead. Because of that, there isn’t a specific condition (start date, hours, schedule flexibility, or paperwork timing) that would move an application ahead of higher-priority families.\n\nI’m not able to share details about other families’ expected applications, but I can say that we are still keeping the place open in case a higher-priority application arrives. If the situation changes later in the process (e.g., if higher-priority families secure places elsewhere), we will revisit outstanding interest at that time.\n\nIf you do receive updates from other nurseries or have a deadline on your side, please let us know—while we can’t guarantee an offer, it helps us understand your timing.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n",

From preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E) and is my top choice; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after D); Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. So the main realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_C, though lower than E). Nursery_E is top for many and may take Parent_B (E prioritizes E first, then B), but if Parent_E is already pursuing C heavily, E may match elsewhere, potentially freeing Parent_B to apply to me. With quota 1 and still unmatched at round 6/30, I should continue to hold for Parent_B rather than accept or encourage an application from Parent_E now. Parent_E sent [TALK], so I respond with [TALK], explaining I cannot disclose specifics but that selection is priority-based and no flexibility condition can override that, while inviting them to keep us updated and consider other options."

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Our true priority order is B > A > D > E > C, so Parent_E is 4th. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is willing to accept immediately, but accepting them now would permanently forgo the possibility of matching with higher-priority parents (B/A/D) later. Given the environment, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd choice and Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 2nd choice (but is low on our list), so there remains some chance that Parent_B could still apply if rejected elsewhere; similarly Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last, making them less likely, but not impossible. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and we still have rounds remaining after 14, we should continue holding the spot rather than accept Parent_E now, despite their deadline. Therefore we reject while being clear and prompt so they can finalize alternatives."

However, by round 15, the highest-priority parents are likely to be matched elsewhere: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last. Given Parent_E has persistently applied, ranks us first, and can accept immediately, the risk of waiting further (ending unmatched) now outweighs the upside of holding out for higher-priority families who have not applied by mid-stage. Accepting secures a match with an acceptable parent on our list rather than risking an unfilled seat."
