Parent_E is 4th, so we should only accept if higher-priority parents are unlikely to apply or can no longer be obtained. Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and Nursery_E ranks Parent_B 2nd, so Parent_B is likely to be taken by Nursery_E if Parent_B applies there. Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so unlikely to apply. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, unlikely to apply. However, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd and could apply if rejected by Nursery_D; Parent_C is below Parent_E in our priority, so not a concern. The main risk is Parent_B possibly turning to Nursery_C if Nursery_E fills with Parent_E or others. But Nursery_E's top priority is Parent_E and Parent_E's top choice is Nursery_C, so Parent_E is repeatedly applying here; Nursery_E may not secure Parent_E. If Parent_B is rejected by Nursery_E (possible if Nursery_E accepts Parent_E or Parent_A first), Parent_B could apply to Nursery_C and would displace Parent_E in our preference. Since we can only accept/reject and acceptance finalizes match, accepting Parent_E now could block a better match with Parent_B. Given uncertainty and our strong preference ordering, continue rejecting Parent_E to preserve the seat for Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D though unlikely)."

Parent_E continues to apply and would accept immediately, but accepting now could block a higher-priority parent (B/A/D) if they approach us in later rounds. Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (but is lowest priority for us), Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely to apply unless they exhaust options. Still, because quota is scarce and we prefer a higher-priority match, and we have been consistently rejecting Parent_E to hold for higher-priority candidates, the consistent strategy is to continue rejecting at round 25 rather than lock in a 4th-choice. There are still rounds remaining (up to 30), so waiting preserves the chance of matching with Parent_B (our top) if they become available."
