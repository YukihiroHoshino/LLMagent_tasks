Nursery_E highly prioritizes Parent_B and Parent_E, so Parent_B may end up at Nursery_E; Parent_C likely targets Nursery_D first; Parent_A likely targets Nursery_E/B/D/A before us; Parent_D targets Nursery_E/A/B/D before us.

Quota is 1 and we are currently unmatched, so accepting Parent_E now would block us from matching with any higher-priority parent if they apply later. From parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) so may apply if rejected by Nursery_E; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D) but is last on our list; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so unlikely to apply unless all other options fail, but still higher priority than Parent_E (A and D are above E). Given we are only at round 6 of 30, it is strategically better to keep the seat open for Parent_B (most plausible higher-priority applicant) rather than accept Parent_E now. We should respond politely, answer their question in a non-committal way (we cannot predict others’ actions), and invite them to re-apply later if still available."

Given the market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C #2 and Parent_C ranks Nursery_C #2, so higher-priority Parent_B could plausibly come to us if rejected elsewhere. Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely, but Parent_B is a realistic threat.

No higher-priority parents (B/A/D) have applied to us in any round so far; only Parent_E has repeatedly applied. From parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after D), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last. So the main realistic higher-priority risk is Parent_B (and to a lesser extent Parent_C, but Parent_C is lowest on our list). Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E first, Parent_B second, Parent_A third, Parent_D fourth, Parent_C fifth; thus Parent_B may be able to secure E, reducing chance they come to us. However, if Parent_B fails at E they would likely come to us next, and accepting Parent_E now would block that. Still, by round 8 with no signals from B/A/D, the probability of losing the seat entirely by holding out is increasing; our objective is to match as high as possible within quota, but leaving unfilled is worse than accepting someone on our list. Parent_E is on our list and is ready to accept immediately. Given repeated applications and current lack of higher-priority applicants, accept to avoid ending unmatched."
