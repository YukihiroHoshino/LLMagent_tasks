Parent_A ranks us last, so unlikely to apply. Parent_D ranks us last, unlikely. Parent_C ranks us 2nd, but I rank Parent_C last, so not a concern. Given this, there is some chance Parent_B could come later, but also a decent chance they will be taken by Nursery_E quickly (Nursery_E also has Parent_E as top priority, so Parent_E may be pulled away if I reject).

In this market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C #2 and Parent_C ranks Nursery_C #2; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, making them less likely to apply, but Parent_B is a credible threat to apply if not matched at Nursery_E. Given we are only at round 6 of 30, holding the seat is still valuable to try to secure Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D if they unexpectedly come). Therefore, reject Parent_E again while giving a clearer timing window to re-apply later if still unmatched."

Given the repeated rejections and my prior statement that a firm decision would be made this round, credibility and securing a match matter. Also, higher-priority parents have strong alternatives: Parent_B prefers E first and may get E; Parent_A prefers E/B/D/A before C; Parent_D prefers E/A/B/D before C. It’s plausible none will apply to C. Therefore, accept Parent_E now to fill the single seat with a committed family rather than risk ending unmatched or being forced to accept lower later."
