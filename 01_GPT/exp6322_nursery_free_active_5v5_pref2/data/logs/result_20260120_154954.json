              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_C’s true priority list (behind Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). Quota is 1 and we are currently unmatched, so our optimal outcome is to wait for a higher-priority parent if there is a reasonable chance they will apply. From parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) so could come to us if rejected by Nursery_E; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D) but is lowest priority for us; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. Nursery_E has top priority Parent_E then Parent_B, so Parent_B may be accepted by Nursery_E, reducing our chance. Still, Parent_B is the key higher-priority candidate; given we are only at round 6/30, it is rational to continue holding the spot and not commit to Parent_E yet. Parent_E is asking for information; we should respond with [TALK], avoid revealing too much, and give a conditional timeline (e.g., reassess in a few rounds) while encouraging them to keep alternatives."

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and aims to match with the highest possible parent on its true priority list: B > A > D > E > C. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C first and is persistent, but E is only 4th on our list. Higher-priority parents (B, A, D) could still apply later: Parent_B has Nursery_C as 2nd choice (after E), Parent_C has Nursery_C as 2nd (but is lowest priority for us), Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so less likely but still possible if rejected elsewhere. Since we have held the seat through multiple rounds explicitly to wait for higher-priority applicants, accepting E now would forgo the chance to match with B (best) if B turns to us after failing at Nursery_E. With no new info that B/A/D are matched elsewhere, optimal strategy is to continue rejecting E for now while providing clearer guidance: we cannot commit this round and will reassess in later rounds."
