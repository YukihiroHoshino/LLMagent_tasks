Since Nursery_E is Parent_B’s top choice and also prioritizes Parent_B highly (2nd) but ranks Parent_E 1st, Parent_E may be taken by Nursery_E if they apply there; however Parent_E has applied to us as first choice. Accepting now secures a match but risks missing Parent_B if Nursery_E rejects them or they later apply here.

              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_C’s true priority list (after Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). With quota 1 and no other applicants in the inbox this round, accepting Parent_E now would fill the spot but risks missing a higher-priority parent who may still apply in remaining rounds. However, given we are already at round 25 with repeated applications from Parent_E and no indication that higher-priority parents are engaging Nursery_C (and many parents rank other nurseries above Nursery_C), the probability of securing Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D at this late stage appears low. To avoid ending unmatched, accept Parent_E now since they are on the acceptable list and ready to finalize immediately."
