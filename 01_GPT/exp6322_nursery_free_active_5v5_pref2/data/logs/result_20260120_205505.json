Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. So the most plausible higher-priority candidate to apply to us later is Parent_B; Parent_A/Parent_D are unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else late in the process. At round 17, there is still time for Parent_B to come if they fail to secure Nursery_E; holding the seat keeps that option open. History shows Parent_E has repeatedly applied and been rejected; consistency suggests we are waiting for higher-priority applicants.

We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, but accepting Parent_E now would prevent us from matching with any higher-priority parent if they apply in remaining rounds (up to round 30). Given Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, and Parent_E ranks us 1st; however, our priorities place Parent_E below several plausible future applicants. With no indication that higher-priority parents are already matched or will not apply, it is strategically better to hold the seat rather than lock in a lower-priority match. History shows repeated applications from Parent_E; we should continue to reject while leaving open the possibility of later reconsideration if still unfilled near the end."
