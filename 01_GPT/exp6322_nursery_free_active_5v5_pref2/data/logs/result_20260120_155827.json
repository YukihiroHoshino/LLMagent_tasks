If we reach the point where we can extend an offer beyond those families, we will contact you promptly.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions",

We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so the optimal outcome is to wait for a higher-priority parent to apply. Parent_E has repeatedly applied/talked and is eager to accept immediately, but accepting them now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_B/A/D if they come later. Since Parent_E sent [TALK] (not [APPLY]), we should not make a binding decision; we should continue to hold the spot and provide the same high-level update without committing. No other messages in inbox this round, so no competing immediate offers to evaluate."

Given many rounds have passed with no higher-priority parent applying to Nursery_C, the likelihood of securing Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D at this late stage appears low. Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched by round 30, which is worse than matching with an acceptable (listed) candidate.
