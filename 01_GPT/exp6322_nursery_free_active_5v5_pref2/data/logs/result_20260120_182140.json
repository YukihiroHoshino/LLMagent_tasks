Parent_E is 4th on my list, so I should avoid committing to them while I still have a realistic chance to match with a higher-priority parent. Current round is 6 and my quota is still open, so there is time to wait. Parent_E has applied multiple times and I have repeatedly rejected, signaling they are not currently in contention for an immediate offer. However, keeping the conversation open via [TALK] preserves flexibility if higher-priority parents never apply. I should be transparent: no immediate offer now, but a conditional possibility if the spot remains unfilled later; encourage them to pursue other options and optionally check back by a given round."
