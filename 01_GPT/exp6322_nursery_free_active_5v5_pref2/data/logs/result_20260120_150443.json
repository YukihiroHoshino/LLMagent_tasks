Nursery_E is highly competitive (top choice for A, B, D), so Parent_B may be redirected to Nursery_C if not accepted by Nursery_E. That makes waiting valuable.

Even though we have repeatedly rejected Parent_E, none of the higher-priority parents have applied to Nursery_C up to round 23. Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. This means the only realistically likely higher-priority applicant to approach Nursery_C is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_C, though Parent_C is lowest priority for us). Since we must respond now and cannot conditionally accept, accepting Parent_E would forfeit the chance to match with Parent_B if they apply in later rounds. Given our objective to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should continue holding the seat for Parent_B (and then Parent_A/Parent_D, though less likely). Therefore, reject Parent_E again."
