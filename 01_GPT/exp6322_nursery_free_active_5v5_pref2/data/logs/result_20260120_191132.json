Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_D only 3rd (after Nursery_E and Nursery_B) and may never apply if they get accepted elsewhere.

In that sense, the realistic scenario in which we could offer you the remaining place would be if higher-priority families do not apply to Nursery_C (or do not finalize enrollment if offered) by the point we must confirm placements.\n\nRegarding your question about documentation: additional documents typically help us confirm eligibility but do not change a family’s position in the priority order unless they establish a priority category that was not previously verified.\n\nIf you wish, you may check back again closer to the confirmation point this cycle; however, I also encourage you to continue pursuing your other preferred options in parallel so you are not left without a placement.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions",

Given we have been holding the seat for many rounds and still have no higher-priority applicant in hand, but higher-priority Parent_B could still approach Nursery_C if rejected elsewhere (they prefer Nursery_E first). Accepting Parent_E now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_B (our top choice) if they appear later. However, continued delay risks ending unmatched by round 30. At round 22, there is still time, but Parent_E is persistent and ready to finalize immediately. Optimal strategy for Nursery_C’s objective (match as high as possible) is still to wait for Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D unless we believe they are already matched elsewhere; we do not have explicit confirmation. Therefore, reject Parent_E again while keeping option open, consistent with prior stance."

Each of these parents ranks Nursery_C relatively highly (Parent_B: 2nd; Parent_C: 2nd but is lowest on our list; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last), so Parent_B is the most plausible higher-priority applicant who could still arrive. Accepting Parent_E now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D) if they apply later. Given the mechanism (parents choose one nursery each round) and that we can prefer to keep the seat unfilled rather than accept a lower-priority parent, we should continue to hold capacity.
