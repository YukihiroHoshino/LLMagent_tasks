              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Our true priority order is B > A > D > E > C, so Parent_E is 4th. Parent_E is repeatedly applying and would accept immediately, but we should still hold out for higher-priority parents if there is a realistic chance they will apply/accept. Check preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_C ranks C 2nd (after D) but is lowest on our list, Parent_A and Parent_D rank C last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere. Parent_B is the key: Nursery_E prioritizes E > B > A > D > C and many parents rank E first; B may or may not end up at E, but could turn to C. However we are at round 24 (late), and no messages from B have arrived; Parent_E is the only active applicant. Given the objective to match as high as possible, but also to secure a match within 30 rounds, continuing to reject E risks ending unmatched if B never comes. With only 6 rounds left and E being acceptable (on our list), accept now to fill the seat rather than gamble."
