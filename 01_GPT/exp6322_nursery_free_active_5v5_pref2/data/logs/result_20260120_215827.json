Although Parent_E is my top choice, Parent_E did not apply this round and in their preferences Nursery_E is last, so it is unlikely they will apply soon (if at all). Accepting Parent_B now secures a highly preferred match and Parent_B also ranks Nursery_E as their first choice, reducing the risk of losing them to another nursery.
