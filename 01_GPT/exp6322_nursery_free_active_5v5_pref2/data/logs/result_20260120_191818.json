Nursery_C still has quota 1 and is currently unmatched, but accepting Parent_E now would block any later approach from higher-priority parents. Given the market preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (but is low priority for us), Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so the main realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_B if they fail to secure Nursery_E. With no messages from higher-priority parents this round and a long history of holding out, there is still a plausible chance Parent_B could come later; however, the rules do not allow tentative holds—[ACCEPT] finalizes the match. To maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority parent, continue to reject Parent_E for now, consistent with prior stance."

From parents’ preferences, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last; so Parent_B is the most plausible higher-priority applicant to come to us, while Parent_A/Parent_D are unlikely but still possible if they strike out. Since we have not yet received any [APPLY] from B/A/D to Nursery_C, but the process is only at round 15/30, accepting Parent_E now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose a better one. Given our stated stance throughout the history (holding for higher-priority families) and no new market info indicating those higher-priority options are exhausted, we should reject this [APPLY] again while keeping the door open to revisit if still unmatched later."

Given we are already at round 16 with no outreach from higher-priority parents, the chance of receiving an [APPLY] from Parent_B or Parent_A soon seems uncertain (Parent_A/D least likely since we are last choice). Holding longer risks ending unmatched by round 30. Accepting Parent_E now yields a guaranteed match, even if not top priority.
