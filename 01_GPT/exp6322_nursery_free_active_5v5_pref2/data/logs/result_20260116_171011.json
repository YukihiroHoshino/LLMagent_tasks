However, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd and could apply later, but Parent_C is my lowest priority. Since I only have quota 1, accepting Parent_E now risks missing a better match if Parent_B or Parent_A later applies. Given Parent_E’s strong interest (Nursery_C is their 1st choice), I can safely reject now to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates, though this risks ending unmatched if none apply.

Given the market info, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last—so Parent_B is the most plausible higher-priority applicant who could still come to us if rejected by Nursery_E. Since round is only 8/30, it is still early enough that holding the seat for higher-priority candidates is valuable.
