In the market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and could come to us if not accepted by Nursery_E; Parent_A ranks us last, so unlikely; Parent_D ranks us last, very unlikely. Given uncertainty about Parent_B and the fact we’re only at round 7/30, it is still optimal to hold the seat for Parent_B a bit longer while keeping Parent_E engaged and ready to apply quickly if our higher-priority options fail to materialize. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK] and give a clear timeline/condition for reconsideration."

From parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_E), so if Parent_B fails to secure Nursery_E, they are quite likely to apply to us soon. Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. Parent_E ranks us 1st and is persistent, making them a strong fallback to avoid ending unmatched. Since Parent_E is only talking (not applying) this round, we should respond with [TALK], be transparent that no higher-priority family has confirmed intent, and set a clear, credible decision rule: hold through round 9, and if no application from Parent_B by start of round 10, invite Parent_E to apply and commit to accept immediately if still unfilled.
