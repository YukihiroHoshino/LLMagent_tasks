Parent_A and Parent_D both rank Nursery_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C second and may apply if Nursery_D doesn’t work out.

However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E) and Parent_A ranks Nursery_C 5th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 5th; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd. Given Nursery_E is top choice for several and may absorb Parent_B, there is still a meaningful chance that a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_B, then Parent_A/Parent_D) could apply to me in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Since I prefer a higher-priority match and am willing to leave the seat unfilled rather than accept someone outside the list (Parent_E is on the list but not high), and we are only at round 6 with no other commitments, it is strategically better to keep the seat available rather than lock in Parent_E now. History shows repeated applications from Parent_E; still, accepting now would foreclose better outcomes."
