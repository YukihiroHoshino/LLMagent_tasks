Parent_E is persistently applying and would accept immediately, but we still prefer to hold the seat for any chance of matching with B/A/D if they become unmatched and apply. Given parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after D), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last. So the most plausible higher-priority candidate for us is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_A/D only if they run out of options). Nursery_E prioritizes E then B then A; Nursery_E likely attracts B, but if B is rejected there, B may come to us. Therefore, rejecting E again preserves optionality to capture Parent_B (our top choice). We can answer E’s timing question while rejecting this round, consistent with prior communications."

Given we have already repeatedly communicated that we are holding for higher-priority families and we are at round 18 (still before the round-30 deadline), the optimal strategy to maximize chance of matching with B/A/D is to continue rejecting E for now.
