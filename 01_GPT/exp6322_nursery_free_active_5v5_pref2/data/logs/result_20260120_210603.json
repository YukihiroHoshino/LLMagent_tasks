              "thought": "Nursery_C priority is B > A > D > E > C, quota 1. Only Parent_E applied this round; no higher-priority parent has applied to Nursery_C across many rounds, but they could still pivot later since Nursery_C is 2nd choice for Parents B and C, 3rd for Parent_C, and last for A and D. Accepting E now would lock us into 4th choice on our list and foreclose the chance to match with B/A/D if they later approach. Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list, continue rejecting E while holding for higher-priority possibilities."

              "thought": "As Nursery_C, my true priority order is B > A > D > E > C, with quota 1. Parent_E is only 4th on my list. Although Parent_E is highly committed and repeatedly applies, accepting now would lock my only seat and prevent matching with any higher-priority parent (B/A/D) should they apply later. Given the environment is parent-initiated, higher-priority parents may still pivot to Nursery_C depending on outcomes at their preferred nurseries. With no evidence that B/A/D are matched elsewhere (not provided), and with rounds remaining (up to 30), the optimal strategy to maximize my match quality is to continue holding the seat rather than accept Parent_E now. Therefore I should reject this round again while remaining polite and consistent with the stated policy."

The only realistically likely higher-priority applicant is Parent_B if they fail to secure Nursery_E; Parent_A/Parent_D are unlikely to ever apply given they rank Nursery_C last. Given we are at round 16 with no higher-priority applications received and Parent_E repeatedly confirms immediate acceptance, continuing to hold risks ending unmatched. Best strategy is to accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than gamble on Parent_B appearing later."
