Given the market, Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_E first, but could later come to us if rejected/unsuccessful there; Parent_C also ranks us 2nd. Therefore, it is strategically better to keep the seat available and maintain Parent_E on a waitlist for late-offer if higher-priority candidates do not materialize by later rounds."

Thus the main threat is Parent_B, who could come to us if rejected by Nursery_E; Parent_C could also come if rejected by Nursery_D. Given it is round 28/30, if we keep rejecting Parent_E and no higher-priority parent applies, we risk ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is on our acceptable list).
