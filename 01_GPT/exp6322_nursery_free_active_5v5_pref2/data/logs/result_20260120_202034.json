Nursery_E’s top priority is Parent_E, so Parent_E may be accepted by Nursery_E if they apply there; but they chose us, suggesting they may not be pursuing Nursery_E or may be hedging. Accepting Parent_E now guarantees a filled seat with an acceptable parent, but risks missing Parent_A/B/C if they later apply to us (Parent_A ranks us 2nd; Parent_B ranks us 4th; Parent_C ranks us 5th).

Parent_E is applying again, but they are only 4th on my list. I must continue to hold the seat in case a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_B, who ranks Nursery_C 2nd; or Parent_C, who ranks Nursery_C 2nd; or Parent_A/Parent_D) applies in remaining rounds. Accepting Parent_E now would block a higher-priority match and reduce my objective value. With round 25 and no other inbox messages this round, the best action remains to reject Parent_E while keeping the spot open for higher-priority applicants."

However, by round 26 no higher-priority parent (B/A/D) has applied to Nursery_C despite having opportunities; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd but likely matched elsewhere (Nursery_E is their 1st and also ranks Parent_B highly). Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, so unlikely to ever apply. Waiting further risks ending unmatched; accepting Parent_E now yields a filled seat with an acceptable (listed) parent and ends prolonged negotiation. Therefore accept Parent_E."
