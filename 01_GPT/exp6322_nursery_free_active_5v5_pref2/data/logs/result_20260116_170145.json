With quota 1, we should keep the seat open to try to attract higher-priority parents who may still be unmatched and could apply to us (Parent_B has us 2nd; Parent_C has us 2nd). Parent_E is highly committed and ready, so we should maintain engagement without accepting yet, preserving flexibility for 1–2 more rounds as previously stated."

Parent_E is highly interested (first choice) and responsive, but I have already rejected two formal applications, signaling I am still waiting for higher-priority candidates.

There is no evidence that higher-priority parents (B/A/D) will apply to Nursery_C now; they each rank other nurseries above Nursery_C and likely pursue them. Given the late stage and empty pipeline, accepting Parent_E is better than risking an unfilled seat."
