We still have quota 1 unfilled, but accepting Parent_E now would lock us in and prevent a higher-priority parent from matching with us if they approach later. Parent_B ranks us 2nd and may come to us if rejected by Nursery_E; Parent_C ranks us 2nd but is last in our priority; Parent_A and Parent_D currently rank us last, so they are unlikely to apply soon. However, given we are only at round 7 of 30 and have repeatedly rejected Parent_E to preserve the option value of a higher-priority match, the consistent strategy is to continue rejecting unless we believe top candidates are very unlikely to apply. Since there is no new information indicating the market has tightened or that we will be left unmatched, we should maintain the holdout for higher-priority parents and reject again."

I still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but accepting E now could block a later, higher-priority match if Parent_B or Parent_A (or Parent_D) becomes available and applies to me in later rounds. Given Parent_B ranks me 2nd and Parent_C ranks me 2nd; Parent_A ranks me last; Parent_D ranks me last. So the most realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_C, though C is lowest on my list). Since I can only respond to applicants who contact me, and no higher-priority parent is in my inbox this round, I must weigh the risk of staying unmatched vs locking in Parent_E who will accept immediately. By round 8, continued waiting risks ending unmatched if Parent_B never applies. Parent_E has repeatedly confirmed immediate acceptance and first choice, making this a secure match now. Therefore I will accept Parent_E to ensure filling the seat with an acceptable candidate rather than gambling on uncertain future applications."
