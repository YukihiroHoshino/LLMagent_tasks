Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_D third (after Nursery_E and Nursery_B) and may not apply soon or at all.

Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E) and Nursery_E ranks Parent_B highly (2nd) so B may match with E, but not guaranteed; Parent_A ranks C last; Parent_D ranks C last; thus chances of higher-priority applicants applying to C may be moderate to low, but still possible if they are rejected elsewhere. Since we are not at the final round and have repeatedly signaled we cannot offer E a spot due to priorities, the strategy to maximize our outcome is to keep the seat open and continue rejecting Parent_E for now."

Parent_B in particular ranks Nursery_C as 2nd choice, so there is a plausible chance they may come if not matched to Nursery_E; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, but could still arrive if rejected elsewhere late. Given the objective to match as high as possible on our priority list and our repeated prior stance to hold the spot for higher-priority families, the optimal decision is to continue rejecting Parent_E until/unless higher-priority options are exhausted. Therefore, reject this application again while reiterating the priority-order constraint and that we will contact them if we can move down the list."

We are in round 29 (penultimate round), and only Parent_E has contacted me this round. Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 2nd (after Nursery_D), while Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. Thus, the only realistic higher-priority threat is Parent_B (and possibly Parent_A/D only if desperate, but they strongly prefer other nurseries). However, given the long history where no higher-priority parent has applied to Nursery_C across many rounds and we are at round 29, the probability that Parent_B suddenly applies in round 30 seems low. If I reject again, I risk ending unmatched at round 30, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is on my acceptable list). Therefore, I should accept Parent_E now to secure a match within quota and maximize outcome given endgame timing."
