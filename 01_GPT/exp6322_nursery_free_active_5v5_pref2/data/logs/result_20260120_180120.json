Parent_E is 4th on my list; I should avoid committing to E if there is a reasonable chance of attracting B/A/D. In the overall market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd, Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. While Parent_E is eager, accepting now could block a higher-priority Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D) if they later apply. Parent_B may apply to Nursery_C if rejected by Nursery_E; Nursery_E prioritizes E then B, so B might still be in play but could lose to E there. Given we are at round 24/30 and no higher-priority applications have arrived to us yet, but time remains, best is to continue TALK without revealing specifics, reiterate we can’t share whether we’re awaiting someone, and suggest Parent_E maintain other options; invite them to apply again if they want to remain active. No APPLY this round, so respond with [TALK]."
