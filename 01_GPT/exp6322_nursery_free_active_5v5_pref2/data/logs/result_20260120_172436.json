Nursery_E likely attracts many first choices (A,B,D) and has its own priority (E first, then B, A, D, C), so B might or might not secure E; if B fails at E, they may apply to us.

Given the history, Parent_E has applied repeatedly and no higher-priority parent has applied to us in the rounds reflected here; still, we cannot infer they will not apply in remaining rounds (up to round 30).

Given we are at round 27 and no other applicants are in my inbox this round, the tradeoff is between securing a match with E now versus holding out. Parents B/A/D all prefer Nursery_C relatively highly (B ranks C 2nd, C ranks C 2nd, A ranks C 5th, D ranks C 5th), so it remains plausible that B or C could apply if rejected elsewhere.

However, with only a few rounds left (round 28/30), the risk of ending unmatched is increasing. Still, objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list; accepting Parent_E now could block a late application from Parent_B (top priority) who values us highly. With no evidence that Parent_B is matched and given they have strong interest in Nursery_C, we should continue to hold the seat rather than accept Parent_E.
