Parent_E (my top choice) has not applied to me and in their preferences Nursery_E is last, so it is unlikely they will approach me later unless rejected everywhere else.

Parent_E strongly prefers me (1st), so accepting would secure a match immediately, but would likely be suboptimal if I can attract any of B/A/D. Check parents' preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after E); Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after D); Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last; Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. So the realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_B (top for me) and possibly Parent_A/D are unlikely to ever apply. Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_E first; Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E then Parent_B, so Parent_B may be rejected by E if E applies there (E does rank C first, so E is not competing for E unless rejected everywhere). Parent_B could later come to me; I should keep the seat available for Parent_B. Given we are only at round 6/30, rejecting Parent_E again is consistent with waiting for higher-priority. Maintain polite waitlist-like language but must formally reject on APPLY."

No other messages this round, but that does not imply higher-priority parents are unavailable. Therefore reject again while keeping them warm with a clear timeline update."
