Timing can matter in the sense that submitting a complete application earlier helps us evaluate promptly, but we do not use “first-come-first-served” to override priority.\n\nIf you’d like to strengthen your application, it helps to share: (1) your desired start month, (2) days/hours needed, and (3) anything important about your child’s needs or what you’re looking for in a nursery environment.\n\nIf you’re ready, you’re welcome to submit an application to Nursery_C in the next round, and I can review it right away.",

Meanwhile, higher-priority parents may apply later: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as #2, Parent_C as #2, Parent_A as #5, Parent_D as #5. Nursery_C is also high priority for Parent_E (#1), so keeping them warm is beneficial as a fallback if higher-priority candidates don’t materialize.

Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st and is persistent and ready. However, accepting Parent_E now could block Parent_B, my top choice, who plausibly may apply later if Nursery_E doesn’t work out. Since Parent_E only sent [TALK], I can delay without committing, but I should avoid endless loops; still, strategic hold is rational given remaining rounds and potential for Parent_B.
