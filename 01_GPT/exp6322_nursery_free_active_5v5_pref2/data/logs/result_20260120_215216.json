Also, Parent_E (my top choice) has not contacted me yet; however, I can still keep the seat open and prioritize the best available applicant now rather than locking in a lower-ranked one.

Nursery_E is top choice for A, B, D and has highest priority E then B then A, so B may end up at E; Parent_E may also be taken by Nursery_E (E’s top priority) if E applies there, but Parent_E prefers C first so likely not. Given we are at round 26 with no other inquiries this round, continued waiting risks leaving the seat empty. However, accepting E would block the possibility of matching with Parent_B if B becomes unmatched and applies to us later. Still, B has strong alternatives (E first, then C) and E (Nursery_E) prioritizes B highly, making it plausible B finalizes elsewhere. Considering lateness (round 26/30), repeated commitment from E, and no evidence of imminent higher-priority applicants, the best way to avoid an unfilled seat is to accept Parent_E now."
