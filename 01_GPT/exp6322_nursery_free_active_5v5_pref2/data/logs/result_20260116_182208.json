Parent_E strongly prefers Nursery_C (#1) and is willing to accept immediately, but accepting now would risk forgoing a higher-priority parent who may still apply later. In the current round, only Parent_E contacted Nursery_C and they sent [TALK], not [APPLY], so no accept/reject decision is required. Given the long history of rejections and prior candid statements that Parent_E is a contingency option, the best strategy is to maintain the same stance: keep them informed that the spot is still unconfirmed, likely to be finalized with preferred candidates soon, and avoid commitments. Provide a rough timeframe (next 1–2 rounds) while advising them to pursue alternatives."

Parent_E strongly prefers us (ranked #1) and is reliable/ready to confirm, so they are a good contingency. However, given we are only at round 16 (out of 30) and higher-priority parents may still come to us (Parent_B ranks us #2; Parent_C ranks us #2 but is last on our list; Parent_A ranks us #5; Parent_D ranks us #5), it is strategically better to continue holding out. Therefore, reject this application while keeping the door open for future reconsideration if the spot remains unfilled after the next 1–2 rounds, consistent with prior communications."
