We still have an open quota and no match yet, so our best outcome is to match with Parent_B (our top), then Parent_A, then Parent_D, all of whom we prefer over Parent_E. From parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks us 2nd (after Nursery_E) so they may come to us if rejected by E; Parent_C ranks us 2nd (after D) but is last on our list; Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last, so unlikely to apply unless they exhaust options. Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E first and Parent_B second, so Parent_B might be taken by E and Parent_E might be taken by E as well—however Parent_E is applying to us first-choice, meaning they may not have secured E. Given Parent_E is only TALKing (not APPLY) and we want to keep the option open while waiting for higher-priority applicants, we should respond candidly but non-committal, encourage them to submit/keep an active application, and avoid signaling a hold that could reduce our flexibility.

So the main realistic threat is Parent_B (and to a lesser extent Parent_C, though Parent_C is last on our priority list). Nursery_E is top choice for A, B, D; Nursery_D is top for C; Nursery_C top for E. Likely many are competing for Nursery_E, meaning Parent_B could fail to secure E and then apply to us.

However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, and Parent_B is our top priority; Parent_A ranks us last; Parent_D ranks us last. Given the round is 25/30, there is still time for higher-priority parents—especially Parent_B—to apply if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Parent_E now would foreclose matching with Parent_B (or Parent_A/Parent_D) should they approach later. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should continue to hold out and reject Parent_E this round despite their strong interest and immediate-accept stance."

Although I have been repeatedly rejected due to priority ordering, the nursery has indicated the seat is not finally committed and can change round to round. With few rounds left, the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to keep an active application in the current round and reiterate immediate acceptance and ability to finalize enrollment instantly, positioning myself as the ready-to-confirm option if higher-priority families do not apply/confirm this round."

Given full market info, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd choice and could plausibly apply if not secured at Nursery_E; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last and are unlikely, but could still reach us late if rejected elsewhere. However, up to round 26 no higher-priority parent has applied to Nursery_C, while Parent_E has consistently applied and would accept immediately. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched by round 30. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match with an acceptable parent on our list, though not the top. With limited rounds remaining and no evidence of higher-priority applications to us, accepting is the best way to avoid an unfilled seat."
