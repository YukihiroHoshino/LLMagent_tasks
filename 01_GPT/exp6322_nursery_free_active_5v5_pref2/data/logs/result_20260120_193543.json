If there is a specific round or decision point you expect to reassess, I would be grateful to know so I can plan my next steps.\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

If we have not received an [APPLY] from any higher-priority family by around rounds 8–10, we will be in a better position to decide whether we can begin offering the place to families next in line.\n\nIf Nursery_C remains your first choice, the best way to be considered at that point is to message us again with an [APPLY] around that reassessment window, and we will respond immediately with a clear decision based on whether the spot is still being held for higher-priority applicants.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C",

Given our priority list, the main upside of waiting is capturing Parent_B (top) if they become available. It is still early (round 6 of 30), so accepting Parent_E now could block a higher-priority match later. Parent_E is only talking, not applying, so we should respond with [TALK], keep them warm, and give a clearer reassessment point without committing."

However, higher-priority parents may still approach us soon: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (but is last on our list), Parent_A and Parent_D rank us last and are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. Given we are only at round 7 and have signaled reassessment around rounds 8–10, accepting Parent_E now risks blocking a potential higher-priority match with Parent_B, the most relevant threat.

Check likelihood of higher-priority parents applying: Parent_B has Nursery_C as 2nd (after E) so may try E first; Parent_A ranks C last; Parent_D ranks C last; thus probability of a better applicant coming is low, especially A and D.
