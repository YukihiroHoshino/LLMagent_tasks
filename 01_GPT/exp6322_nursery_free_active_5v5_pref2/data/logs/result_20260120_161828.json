We should continue to hold the seat for higher-priority parents if there is a realistic chance they will apply. From parents’ preference lists: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D) but is last on our list, Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. Nursery_E is likely to attract Parent_B (2nd on E’s priority) and Parent_E (1st on E’s priority) but Parent_E already prefers us. If Nursery_E fills with Parent_E or others, Parent_B may then apply to Nursery_C as their next choice, making them a credible imminent higher-priority applicant. Similarly, if Parent_B is rejected/doesn’t match at Nursery_E, they could come to us soon. Therefore accepting Parent_E now would risk losing a much higher-priority match. Given round 6 of 30, it is still early; optimal strategy is to reject Parent_E again while signaling possibility later if higher-priority candidates resolve elsewhere."
