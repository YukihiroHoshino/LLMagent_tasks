Nursery_E is top choice for A, B, D and likely absorbs Parent_B; Parent_E is top for E and has persistently applied to me, indicating strong availability. Given many rounds have passed (round 20) with no outreach from Parent_B (my top) or Parent_A/D, the risk of losing the seat by waiting further is increasing.
