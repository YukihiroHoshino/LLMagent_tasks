Parent_C is applying now and ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice, so acceptance likely locks a stable, high-quality match. Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A’s top choices are Nursery_E and Nursery_B, and they may never apply to Nursery_D. With quota 1 and no other inbox messages, accepting Parent_C maximizes expected outcome while still being near-top priority."

Nursery_E is my #1, and while their priority ranks Parent_A behind Parent_E and Parent_B, applying immediately gives me the best chance before they commit elsewhere.

In this same round, we have applications from Parent_E and Parent_B (both higher priority than Parent_A) as well as Parent_D (lower than Parent_A). With quota 1, accepting Parent_A now would block us from matching with Parent_E or Parent_B, who are available and have applied.

Nursery_A is my 2nd choice and also unlikely to accept me (I am last in Nursery_A’s priority). Nursery_D is my 3rd choice and ranks me 4th, but Parent_A is likely to prioritize Nursery_E/B over D, and Parent_C (who ranks D #1) is a key competitor. My best strategic move is to apply immediately to Nursery_E: it is my 5th choice but it ranks me #1, so I can secure a guaranteed match rather than risk being rejected by higher choices and ending up worse off. Given the one-shot per round constraint and competitive pressure on my top choices, locking in Nursery_E now maximizes my chance of being matched at all, though it sacrifices rank on my preference list."
