Given the market preferences, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd, Parent_C as 2nd, and Parent_A/Parent_D rank us last; thus Parent_B is the most plausible higher-priority applicant to arrive. Since we prefer a higher-ranked parent and have no deadline pressure at round 6/30, it is strategically better to continue rejecting Parent_E to keep the seat available for Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D if they approach.
