Our quota is 1 and we are still unmatched, so accepting Parent_E now could block a higher-priority parent if they approach later. Given Parent_E has repeatedly applied and we have consistently held the spot for higher-priority families, and there are no new signals that higher-priority parents are definitively matched elsewhere, the optimal strategy to maximize our match quality is to continue rejecting Parent_E until we are confident higher-priority options are exhausted. Inbox this round contains only Parent_E, but absence of others this round is not proof they won’t come forward later. Therefore, reject again while keeping the position open for higher-priority applicants."

Higher-priority threats are mainly Parent_B (and possibly Parent_A/Parent_D only if displaced). With quota 1 and round 16/30, accepting Parent_E now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D if they approach later. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and we are allowed to remain unfilled rather than take a lower-priority match, we should continue to hold.

However, by round 18 the only active contact is Parent_E and they rank Nursery_C first, so acceptance would lock in a feasible match now. The higher-priority parents (B, A, D) all prefer other nurseries over Nursery_C and may already be matched elsewhere; continued waiting risks ending unmatched by round 30.
