I should keep Parent_E engaged without committing, explain that offers follow the stated priority order, and suggest applying soon if they want to be considered, while being transparent that higher-priority applicants could displace them.

Given Nursery_E is top choice for A/B/D and has its own priorities (E > B > A > D > C), B is highly likely to be accepted by Nursery_E, reducing chance B comes to us.
