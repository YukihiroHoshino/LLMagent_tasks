              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched. True priority order is B > A > D > E > C, so Parent_E is 4th. Parent_E strongly prefers Nursery_C (ranked 1st) and is repeatedly applying with a deadline (end of Round 16). However, higher-priority parents (B, A, D) could still apply in future rounds; in particular Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd and Parent_C ranks it 2nd, though Parent_C is lowest priority for us. Accepting Parent_E now would foreclose matching with B/A/D if they come later, which would reduce our objective value. Given we still have rounds remaining and no new information confirming higher-priority parents are placed elsewhere, we should continue holding and reject per our policy. We can request any docs to expedite if the spot becomes available and invite them to re-apply in Round 15/16."

However, by Round 15, higher-priority parents (B, A, D) have not approached us despite many rounds. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd but prefers Nursery_E first; Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, making it very unlikely they will apply now. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to commit immediately, with a stated deadline (end of Round 16). Holding out further risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting a listed parent. Therefore, accept Parent_E now to secure a match."
