However, by round 15 only Parent_E is actively contacting Nursery_C and repeatedly signaling immediate acceptance; no higher-priority parents are in the inbox or appear likely to switch to Nursery_C soon given their preference lists (Parent_B and Parent_C rank Nursery_C 2nd; Parent_A and Parent_D rank it last). Since Parent_E has not sent [APPLY] this round, I cannot accept anyway. Best strategy is to keep Parent_E warm on standby via [TALK] while leaving room to accept a higher-priority applicant if one appears before round limit; also confirm contact details received."
