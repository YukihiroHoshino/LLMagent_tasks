We are still unmatched at round 25, so there is some risk of ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply; however, accepting E now would block us from matching with B/A/D if they apply later. Given the repeated applications from E and no indication that higher-priority parents are unavailable, the best strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue holding the seat for higher-priority families and reject E again."

Parent_E is only [TALK] this round, so no accept/reject decision is required. Best strategy is to maintain standby messaging: reiterate we must hold to priority order, cannot give timeline, and invite Parent_E to continue to send [APPLY] to signal readiness without committing.
