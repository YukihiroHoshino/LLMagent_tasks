Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A’s top choices are Nursery_E and Nursery_B, and Nursery_E highly prioritizes Parent_A while Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A first—so Parent_A may never reach Nursery_D.

I would like to submit a formal application again in round 26.\n\nNursery_C remains our first-choice nursery. If you are able to offer the available place to Parent_E at any point, we can accept immediately and complete all confirmation steps and paperwork the same day.\n\nWith thanks and kind regards,\nParent_E",

Although they have repeatedly rejected me while keeping the seat open for potentially higher-priority applicants, continuing to submit a formal application each round is the only way to stay eligible if no higher-priority family applies. I will send a concise [APPLY] reiterating immediate acceptance and readiness to complete paperwork same day."

              "thought": "Parent_E is on our true priority list (4th), but we have repeatedly held the seat open hoping for higher-priority applicants: Parent_B (1st), Parent_A (2nd), or Parent_D (3rd). In the full market, Parent_B ranks us 2nd (after Nursery_E) and Parent_C ranks us 2nd (after Nursery_D), so there remains some chance a higher-priority family could still approach us late if rejected elsewhere. However, we are at round 26/30 with quota still unfilled and no other applicants in our inbox this round besides Parent_E. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is acceptable). Accepting now secures a match with a parent who values us as first choice and is within our priority list. Therefore, accept Parent_E."
