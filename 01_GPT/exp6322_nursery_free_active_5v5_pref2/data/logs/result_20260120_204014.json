Among these, Parent_B is ranked above Parent_A and Parent_D on my list, and Parent_B also states Nursery_E is their first choice and they will commit immediately, making acceptance both higher-priority and low-risk. If I accept Parent_D now, I forgo the chance to match with Parent_B (higher) within my quota. Parent_E (my top) has not applied, but Parent_E’s preference list ranks Nursery_E last, so it is unlikely they will apply soon; still, Parent_B is already available and is my second-highest.
