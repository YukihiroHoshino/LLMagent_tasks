From the market preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last, making them unlikely to apply. The most realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_B; Parent_A/Parent_D are unlikely, and Parent_C is lower priority than Parent_E for us.
