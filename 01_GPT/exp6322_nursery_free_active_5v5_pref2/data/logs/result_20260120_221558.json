Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_D 3rd and may match with Nursery_E or Nursery_B first.

Given the market information: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D) but Nursery_C ranks Parent_C last, Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C last. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. Since higher-priority families (especially Parent_B) could still apply and would be preferable, Nursery_C should avoid committing to Parent_E prematurely. However, to avoid endless stalling and to progress, Nursery_C can invite an [APPLY] while clearly stating it cannot yet offer and will decide strictly by priority if/when higher-priority families do not proceed. Since the parent’s message is [TALK], respond with [TALK] and maintain the same stance."
