I’m writing again this round to formally re-apply, as Nursery_C remains our first choice.\n\nIf your place is still available after higher-priority families have been contacted, we can confirm immediately and complete enrollment/paperwork the same day. We remain fully flexible on start date (immediate through the next 1–3 months) and can adapt to full-time, part-time, or a phased start—whatever best matches your current availability.\n\nIf there is any final step you need from us to make a quick decision (documents, reference, visit/meeting), please let me know and we will do it right away.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E\n\n[APPLY]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is my top true preference and the only nursery still unmatched. I have been rejected multiple times, likely due to higher-priority families, but Nursery_C indicated a realistic path if higher-priority families do not take the place. Since this is a one-seat situation, the best strategy is to re-apply with a very clear, immediate-commitment message and emphasize maximum flexibility so they can fill the seat quickly if their top-choice families decline."

We appreciate your flexibility and readiness to complete the enrollment steps promptly.\n\nWe are able to offer you our available place this round.

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched. Our true priority list ranks Parent_E 4th (above Parent_C but below Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). In round 6, the only message in our inbox is an [APPLY] from Parent_E; no higher-priority parents are currently engaging us. Given repeated rejections already, but continued availability and no evidence that Parent_B/Parent_A/Parent_D will apply to Nursery_C soon (they each prefer Nursery_E first and may match elsewhere), holding the seat risks ending unmatched or being forced to accept an even lower option later. Parent_E has strong interest (Nursery_C is their first choice) and high commitment to enroll immediately, which reduces uncertainty. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) parent and avoids vacancy risk."
