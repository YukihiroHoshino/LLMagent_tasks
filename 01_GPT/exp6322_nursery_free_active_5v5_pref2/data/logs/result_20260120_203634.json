Given Parent_E has repeatedly applied and we have consistently rejected to preserve the option of matching with a higher-priority parent if they apply. However, by round 15, no higher-priority parent has approached us, and Parent_E is indicating Nursery_C is the only remaining unmatched nursery and their first choice, suggesting other matches may already be stable. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], we should not accept yet; we should respond transparently within constraints: we cannot promise availability or predict other families’ actions, but we will consider any [APPLY] each round and will prioritize higher-ranked applicants if they appear. Encourage them to apply if they want to be considered immediately, while not committing to an offer."

However, by round 16 no higher-priority parent (B/A/D) has applied to Nursery_C; they all rank Nursery_C low (B: 2nd, C: 2nd, but B may be pursuing Nursery_E first; A and D rank C last). Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C first and has repeatedly committed to immediate acceptance, making the match secure once offered. Given the late stage and absence of higher-priority applicants in the inbox/history, accepting Parent_E now maximizes the chance of filling our seat rather than remaining empty."
