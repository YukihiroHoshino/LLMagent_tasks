While Parent_B is my top choice, Parent_B’s preferences rank Nursery_A last, so it’s unlikely they will apply soon (they will pursue Nursery_E/C/D/B first).

Given the market preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_E), Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_D), Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st. Our top candidates (especially Parent_B) may still become available if they are rejected by higher choices (notably Nursery_E) in late rounds. With quota 1 and round 27, accepting Parent_E now would foreclose the chance to match with a higher-priority parent if they turn to us in rounds 28–30. Since we prefer a higher-priority match and still have time, we continue to hold the seat and reject Parent_E this round, consistent with prior rounds."
