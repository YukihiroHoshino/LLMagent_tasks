Timing matters in the sense that earlier complete applications are easier to evaluate promptly, but we do not guarantee a spot until we formally accept.\n\nTo make your application most competitive, it helps to share: (1) your preferred start date and schedule needs, (2) any sibling/continuity considerations, and (3) any factors that make Nursery_D a particularly strong fit for your child.\n\nWe may still have space after higher-priority families finalize decisions, so if Nursery_D is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready and let us know how highly you’re ranking us—this helps us plan responsibly.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your ideal start date and whether Nursery_D is among your top 1–2 choices right now.",

Please reply to confirm, and we’ll send the enrollment packet and next-step details (required forms and a brief orientation/visit time). If you’re able, please also share your preferred start date and any schedule needs so we can finalize everything quickly.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming your family to Nursery_A.",

With quota 1 and only Parent_D and Parent_E remaining, accepting Parent_D secures a top-priority match. Parent_B (#1) is not in the remaining pool, so waiting risks losing Parent_D and ending with either Parent_E (lowest on our list) or an unfilled seat. Parent_D also ranks Nursery_A 2nd, indicating strong commitment and low risk of withdrawal. Therefore accept immediately and move to finalize enrollment steps."
