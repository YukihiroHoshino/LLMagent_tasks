Typically this begins with short parent-and-child visits, then brief separations, building up to a full session as your child shows readiness. We assign a key person to your child for attachment and routine consistency, and we’ll coordinate daily updates during the first weeks.\n\nIf helpful, could you share your child’s age and any specific needs (sleep, separation anxiety, allergies, language at home)?
