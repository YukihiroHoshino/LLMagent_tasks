During the first 2–3 weeks we proactively share a bit more so you’re not left wondering.\n- **Quick messaging for anything important** (e.g., if your child is unusually upset or there’s something we want you to know immediately).\n- **Regular check-ins with the key person** during the settling period to align on strategies that work at home and at nursery.\n\n3) **Key strengths for this age group**\n- **Warm, structured routine:** predictable rhythms help children feel safe while still leaving plenty of room for play and curiosity.\n- **Language + social-emotional development through play:** small-group stories/songs, turn-taking games, role play, and guided support for early friendships.\n- **Everyday independence:** simple self-help skills (tidying, handwashing routines, choosing activities) built in gently.\n- **Outdoor play daily:** we treat outdoor time as core learning, not an “extra.”\n- **Strong settling expertise:** we’re very intentional about transitions, and we partner closely with families so children don’t just “cope,” they genuinely settle.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, it would help me advise you realistically about fit and timing: **your child’s age**, **preferred start date**, and **the days/hours you’re hoping for**.
