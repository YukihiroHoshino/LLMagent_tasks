Within that structure, children get substantial choice time in centers (blocks, pretend play, art, sensory, books), and we balance guided activities with child-led exploration.\n\n**Early literacy:** We focus on building foundations through read-alouds, songs/rhymes, vocabulary-rich conversation, print awareness (books, labels, name recognition), and fine-motor/pre-writing activities—without pushing formal academics too early.\n\n**Social-emotional development:** We emphasize routines, emotional labeling, turn-taking, cooperative play, and gentle conflict resolution. Teachers coach children through peer interactions and help them practice independence and self-regulation.\n\n**Timeline/decisions & availability:** We review applications on a rolling basis and typically respond quickly once we have the key details (age/class placement, start date, and schedule).

Remaining unmatched options are only Nursery_B and Nursery_C; Nursery_C is my #1, so I should preserve flexibility for Nursery_C. However, if I wait too long, Nursery_B could match with another parent if they approach. Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me 4th (after A, B, C), so my chances may be moderate-to-low if higher-priority parents apply. Still, since it’s round 3 and I have not applied anywhere yet, I should keep Nursery_B warm without committing, and try to learn whether they expect higher-priority applicants. So I will [TALK] rather than [APPLY] this round to avoid locking in a lower-ranked match before attempting Nursery_C."
