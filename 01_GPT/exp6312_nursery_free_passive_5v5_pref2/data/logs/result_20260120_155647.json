Children who don’t sleep can do calm activities (books/puzzles) so the room stays restful for sleepers.\n- Rhythm of the day: a predictable routine (arrival/free play → circle/story → learning centers/small groups → outdoor → lunch → rest → afternoon small group/creative play → pick-up).

What you described (warm structure, outdoor time, clear communication, and a supportive settling-in) is very aligned with how we run the classroom.\n\n1) **Typical adult-to-child ratio**\n- We generally operate around **1:6–1:8** depending on the time of day (arrival/pickup tends to be a bit higher coverage, and we add support when we can for transitions and small groups). We keep the group intentionally small so we can stay responsive.\n\n2) **Naps + meals with different routines**\n- **Rest time:** we have a consistent quiet/rest block after lunch. Children who nap do so on their own mats; for non-nappers we provide calm alternatives (books, quiet table activities) while maintaining a restful environment.\n- **Different routines:** we’re flexible within reason—especially during the settling-in period—while gently working toward a predictable classroom rhythm.\n- **Meals:** we support different appetites and pacing, encourage independence, and accommodate common needs (e.g., separating foods, smaller portions first). If there are any allergies or dietary restrictions, we plan those carefully with families.\n\n3) **Visit / observation opportunities**\n- Yes—**we can usually arrange a short visit/observation** (typically 20–30 minutes) at a time that minimizes disruption to the children’s routines. If you’d like, we can aim to schedule something within the next round.\n\nSince we have **one spot** and we’re getting close to decision timing, the last key piece for us is logistics: what **days/hours** do you need, and do you anticipate any recurring constraints (late pickups, rotating schedules, etc.)? If that aligns, I’d strongly encourage you to **submit an application** so we can move quickly if we’re a mutual top choice.",
