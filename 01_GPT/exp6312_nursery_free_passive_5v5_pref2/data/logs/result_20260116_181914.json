We balance structure with flexibility so children feel secure while still exploring.\n\nApproach to early learning: Our focus is play-based and developmentally appropriate. We build early literacy and numeracy through stories, conversation, games, and hands-on materials. We also emphasize social-emotional skills—turn-taking, naming feelings, problem-solving with peers—and we communicate regularly with families about progress.\n\nSupporting transitions for new children: We use a gradual transition plan when possible (short initial stays that lengthen over time), a consistent key person for your child, and familiar routines to build trust. We also partner closely with parents on comfort items, separation strategies, and daily feedback so the first weeks feel steady and predictable.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines that help) and what matters most to your family—so I can speak to fit more specifically.

Typically we offer a phased entry over the first 1–2 weeks (short initial sessions that lengthen), and we can include a parent stay-and-play at the start if that helps your child feel secure. We assign a consistent key person who greets your child each day and anchors the routine, and we’ll agree together on separation steps (comfort item, goodbye routine, timing) so it’s predictable.\n\nDay-to-day communication: We do brief daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up, and we also provide same-day updates (meals, naps, mood, notable moments/learning) via our parent communication channel. For anything more significant (e.g., settling concerns, friendships, behavior patterns), we reach out directly and can schedule a quick check-in so it doesn’t get lost in the rush.\n\nWhat we prioritize in admissions: Above all, we look for a good fit and a collaborative partnership—families who value a play-based approach, consistent routines, and open communication. Schedule needs matter mainly so we can reliably staff and support your child’s pattern (e.g., very long days or irregular attendance can be harder during the settling period, though we try to accommodate when we can).\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: what age is your child and how do they typically handle new environments/separations?

Community ties can be a plus, but they’re not required.\n\nA typical day (high-level)\n- Arrival & settling-in: greeting, free-choice play, and a calm transition\n- Morning circle: songs, stories, sharing, and routine-building\n- Learning through play: rotating stations (language, early numeracy, sensory play, arts)\n- Outdoor time: gross-motor play and nature-based activities when possible\n- Lunch/snack & hygiene routines\n- Rest/quiet time (age-appropriate)\n- Afternoon play + small-group activities\n- Pick-up with a brief handover\n\nKey steps / dates to be considered seriously\n- The most important step is submitting a formal application when you’re ready, and confirming your intended start date and the schedule you need.\n- If you’d like, we can also schedule a short visit/chat (virtual or in-person) to confirm fit and answer practical questions.\n\nTo guide you best: what start month are you considering, and what days/hours would you ideally need (full-time vs. part-time)? Also, are you flexible if your first-choice schedule isn’t immediately available?\n\n[TALK]",
