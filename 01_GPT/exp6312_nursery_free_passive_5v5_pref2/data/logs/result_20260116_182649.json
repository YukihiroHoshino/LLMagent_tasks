I already tried Nursery_B earlier and, given Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me last, my chances there are weak. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (behind Parent_B), so I have a strong chance if I apply promptly and signal commitment/flexibility. Therefore, I should formally apply to Nursery_A with a clear, concise appeal and readiness to provide documents and confirm timing."
