We try to make decisions promptly once we confirm fit and availability.\n\nA few questions so I can be specific:\n1) What’s your child’s age and prior childcare/group experience?\n2) What schedule do you need (days/hours), and how fixed is it?\n3) Any adjustment concerns you already anticipate (separation, sensory needs, nap, toileting)?\n\nIf you share those, I can outline what an onboarding/transition plan would look like for your child and what the realistic decision window is from here.",

Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me last, so if any other parent is still in play for Nursery_C, I would lose; however, since only Nursery_C is unmatched, others may already be matched or not pursuing it. Best strategy is a clear, time-bounded commitment and request for a yes/no this round, offering immediate paperwork and flexibility."
