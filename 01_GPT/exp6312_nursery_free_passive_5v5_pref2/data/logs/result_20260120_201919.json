B has not applied yet and may be aiming for higher choices; C ranks us last and is unlikely to apply.

Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like a strong fit with Nursery_D, and we’d be happy to offer you a place.\n\nA bit about our daily flow (typical day, adjusted for weather and the group):\n- Arrival & settling-in: calm play/teacher check-ins\n- Morning circle: songs, stories, routine-building and social skills\n- Learning through play: rotating stations (sensory, art, building, pretend play)\n- Outdoor time: daily (usually a longer block in the morning; we also go out again later when possible)\n- Lunch: family-style when appropriate; we support independence and good routines\n- Nap/rest: after lunch with a consistent wind-down routine; quiet activities for children who don’t sleep\n- Afternoon: outdoor/large-motor + small-group activities, then pick-up\n\nHow we keep families updated:\n- Brief daily update (highlights of the day, meals/rest, notable moments) via our usual communication channel\n- Ongoing teacher-parent communication at drop-off/pick-up as needed\n- Scheduled check-ins/conferences during the year, and we’re proactive if any support needs come up\n\nIf you’d like, reply with your child’s age and desired start date, plus any allergies/support needs, and we’ll confirm the onboarding steps and next paperwork right away.",

With quota 1 and remaining unmatched parents including Parent_B and Parent_E (both lower on our list than Parent_C), accepting now secures an excellent match and avoids risk of losing Parent_C to another nursery.
