Given the one-shot-per-round constraint and that an immediate acceptance at C locks in a very good outcome, I should apply to Nursery_C now."

I have top priority at Nursery_E, but I should first pursue higher true preferences (C, A, D, B) since there is no risk in waiting this early and no prior commitments.

We’re glad to speak with you.\n\nAt Nursery_E, we tend to thrive with families who value:\n- **Consistent routines & predictable schedules:** We can accommodate a range of drop-off/pick-up needs, but we do best when the weekly pattern is stable and communicated early.\n- **A gentle, child-led adjustment process:** We use a gradual settling-in plan (short initial visits, then longer stays) and we partner closely with you on comfort items, separation routines, and pacing.\n- **Clear, proactive communication:** We prioritize quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, and we’re responsive if anything changes at home (sleep, feeding, big transitions). We appreciate families who share updates so we can support the child consistently.\n\nTo help me understand fit: what are your child’s current schedule needs (start time/pick-up window), and what kind of communication style do you prefer (daily brief updates vs. more detailed periodic check-ins)?",

Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_E, so Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_E first, making it plausible I can secure Nursery_A if I apply now.
