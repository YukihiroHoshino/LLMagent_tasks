That said, we do review each family on fit and try to be transparent about whether a place looks realistic as we learn more.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about:\n1) your needed start month and weekly schedule (days/hours),\n2) anything important about your child’s temperament (slow-to-warm vs. eager), and\n3) any allergies/support needs.\n\nWith that, I can give a clearer sense of fit and whether it looks realistic for this round.",

Typically it starts with short visits with a parent/carer present, then brief separations, building up to a full morning/nap/lunch as the child is ready. We keep a consistent key-person approach so your child has a familiar adult anchoring the transition, and we’ll agree a plan with you in advance (what goodbyes look like, comfort items, sleep routines, etc.).\n\nDaily communication: we do a quick handover at drop-off and pick-up as standard. We also share regular updates (highlights from the day, meals/rest/toileting notes as needed). For anything more substantial, we’re happy to schedule a call/meeting—especially during the first few weeks—to make sure settling-in is going smoothly.\n\nTimeline & availability: we have very limited places this year, and we expect decisions to move on a fairly tight timeline as families confirm. If Nursery_B is a serious top choice for you, applying soon is the best way to be considered while we still have availability.\n\nTo give you the most accurate sense of fit and timing, could you share (1) your child’s age, (2) ideal start date, and (3) the schedule you need (days/hours)?

When we’re down to one spot, the biggest differentiators are (a) schedule fit/consistency with the slot we’re trying to fill, (b) start-date alignment, and then (c) responsiveness/communication and overall classroom balance.
