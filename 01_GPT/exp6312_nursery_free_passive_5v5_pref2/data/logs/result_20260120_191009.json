Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me 2nd (behind Parent_A). Parent_A’s top choices are Nursery_E then Nursery_B, and Nursery_E is already matched, so Parent_A may now be pursuing Nursery_B rather than Nursery_D. Parent_D prefers E/A/B over D and is lower priority at D than me. Parent_E prefers C/A/D but is lower priority at D than me. Parent_B ranks D 3rd and is lowest priority at D. So I have a strong chance at D if I apply now; waiting risks losing the seat if another parent applies unexpectedly. Best move: apply immediately and signal readiness to commit."
