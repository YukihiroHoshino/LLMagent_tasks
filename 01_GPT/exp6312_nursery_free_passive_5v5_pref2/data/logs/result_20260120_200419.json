If you think Nursery_C could be a good match, it helps to let us know sooner rather than later.\n\nTo make this most useful—what are the top 2–3 things you’re looking for (schedule, approach to behavior guidance, outdoor time, language support, etc.) and any specific needs we should understand?",

Children who sleep do so on their own mat/bed with familiar comfort items if you prefer. If a child doesn’t sleep, we support “quiet rest” (books, calm table activities) so everyone gets a reset.\n- Meals: We keep mealtimes calm and social—teachers sit with children, model routines, and encourage independence. We can accommodate common dietary restrictions/allergies with clear documentation and coordination.\n- Flexibility: We keep the overall rhythm consistent (it helps children feel secure), but we individualize within it—especially around sleep needs, settling strategies, and pacing at meals.\n\n3) Social-emotional development & transitions\n- We explicitly teach skills like turn-taking, naming feelings, asking for help, and repairing after conflict (e.g., simple scripts: “Can I have a turn after you?” / “I didn’t like that—please stop.”).\n- Teachers use positive guidance: clear boundaries, calm tone, and coaching rather than punishment.\n- Transitions: We use predictable cues (warnings, songs/visual prompts), offer small choices (“walk or hop to wash hands?”), and support children who need extra time with a consistent adult and a simple step-by-step plan.\n- We also communicate closely with families so strategies are consistent between home and school.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and anything that tends to be tricky (separation at drop-off, nap resistance, food selectivity, big transitions), I can tell you exactly how we’d support them.

However, to avoid ending up unmatched if E and B are taken unexpectedly, I should keep Nursery_C warm without committing. I have already talked twice; now I should signal continued interest and ask for timeline/next steps, but not apply yet."
