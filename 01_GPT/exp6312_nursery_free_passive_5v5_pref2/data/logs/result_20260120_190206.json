In practice, once we have a complete application and a brief meet-and-greet (in person or virtual), we aim to make a decision quickly—typically within about a week, sometimes sooner depending on scheduling. Because we have a single place, we may extend an offer as soon as we confirm a strong fit, rather than waiting for a single fixed date.\n\n(2) What strengthens an application: The most helpful items are (a) clarity on start date and schedule (days/hours, any care constraints), (b) consistency/long-term stability (so the placement is sustainable), (c) a clear picture of your child—temperament, interests, what helps with transitions, any supports that have worked well, and (d) alignment with our routines/values (kindness, cooperation, respectful communication, partnership with teachers). If you have flexibility on start date or pickup/drop-off windows, that can help, but it’s not required—clarity matters most.\n\nIf you’re willing, could you share your child’s age, any ideal start date, and your needed weekly schedule?

Social-emotional development is supported through:\n- consistent routines and clear expectations\n- coached peer interaction (turn-taking, sharing, problem-solving language)\n- small-group activities that build listening, empathy, and self-regulation\nEarly learning is embedded through play (stories, songs, phonological awareness games, counting/sorting, fine-motor and pre-writing through art/sensory/building), rather than formal worksheets.\n\nVisits / interviews\nYes—visits are the best next step if you’re still deciding. We typically offer short morning visits (30–45 minutes) so you can see the classroom in action, followed by a brief Q&A.
