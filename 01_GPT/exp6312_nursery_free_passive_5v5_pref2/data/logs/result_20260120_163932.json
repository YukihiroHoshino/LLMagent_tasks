We post the day’s flow for families and keep transitions consistent so children know what to expect.\n\nApproach to early learning/play: Our core is learning through play—hands-on exploration, language-rich interactions, and social-emotional skill building (turn-taking, feelings, problem-solving). Teachers observe interests and extend them with purposeful activities (early literacy through stories/songs, early numeracy through games/building, and creative arts/sensory play).\n\nSupporting transitions for new children: We use a gradual entry plan when possible (shorter initial days), a consistent key person for your child, and comfort routines (family photo/comfort item, clear goodbye ritual). We also provide frequent check-ins during the first weeks and share quick updates so you feel confident about how your child is settling.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what a “good day” looks like for them (energy level, nap needs, any separation worries), I can describe exactly how we’d tailor the start. If Nursery_E feels like it could be a fit, you’re very welcome to apply this round or schedule a brief visit/chat.",

We’ll agree the plan with you in advance and adjust if your child settles faster (or needs a bit more time).\n\n**Separation anxiety:** We use a consistent “key person” approach so your child has one main adult anchoring their day. We also:\n- keep a predictable goodbye routine (short, consistent, and supported by staff)\n- offer a comfort item/family photo if helpful\n- engage quickly in a preferred activity right after goodbye\n- check in with you proactively during the first days so you’re not left wondering how things are going\n\n**Communication with families:** You can expect a mix of:\n- a brief daily check-in at drop-off/pick-up\n- a short end-of-day note (how they ate, slept/rested, mood, highlights)\n- periodic photos/updates (we’re mindful to balance sharing with staying present with the children)\n- extra messages/calls during the first week if separation is tough—typically a quick reassurance update once they’re calm and engaged\n\nIf you share your child’s age and whether mornings or afternoons are usually easier for them (and any nap needs), I can suggest a specific gradual-start schedule.
