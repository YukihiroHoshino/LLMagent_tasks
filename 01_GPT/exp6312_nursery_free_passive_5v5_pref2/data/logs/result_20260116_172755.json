Happy to confirm details.\n\nExtended care / flexibility:\n- Our standard day is ~8:30–15:30, with aftercare until ~17:30.\n- We can sometimes accommodate an earlier drop-off (typically from ~8:00) and/or a slightly later pickup beyond 17:30 on a limited basis, depending on staffing that term. If you tell me the exact times you’d need (days per week and earliest/latest), I can confirm what’s feasible.\n\nSupporting transitions (first weeks, separation, moving between activities):\n- We use a gradual-entry approach when helpful (shorter initial days, parent/guardian goodbye routine, consistent handoff plan).\n- Key-person system: one educator takes special responsibility for building trust with your child and coordinating with you.\n- Predictable routines + visual cues (picture schedules, “first/then,” transition warnings, songs) to reduce anxiety.\n- For separation: we coach a consistent, brief goodbye and then engage the child quickly in a preferred activity; we’ll update you as needed until things settle.\n- Between activities: small-group transitions, clear expectations, and choices (e.g., “walk or hop to circle”) to keep it positive.\n\nVisits/observations:\n- Yes— we can arrange a short visit/observation window on select mornings. Share a few times that work for you next week (or the week after), and we’ll schedule it.\n\nIf Nursery_A is still in consideration, I’d encourage you to visit soon—our single available spot can move quickly once families begin applying. If you’d like, you can also share your child’s age and your needed schedule, and I’ll confirm fit right away.",

              "message": "[TALK] Thanks, Parent_E—happy to clarify.\n\nHow we decide once an application comes in:\n- With only one spot, we generally don’t “batch” applications for a long comparison window. If we receive a complete application from a family that’s a clear fit, we may move quickly (sometimes within a round or two) to extend an offer rather than holding the seat.\n- That said, we do a quick fit check (usually a short call/visit + confirming schedule/start-date alignment). If there are multiple strong, complete applications at the same time, we compare them, but we don’t plan to wait many rounds just to see who else might apply.\n\nWhat we prioritize most among interested families:\n1) Schedule match & reliability (drop-off/pick-up consistency with our hours)\n2) Start date fit / flexibility (ability to start when the spot opens is a plus)\n3) Family–school partnership (communication, alignment with our play-based but structured approach)\n4) Child readiness for group routines (age-appropriate independence/self-help)\nProximity is helpful, but usually secondary to the above.\n\nIf Nursery_B is a top option for you, the best way to stay competitive is to submit when you’re ready—because once we see a strong fit, we may finalize quickly.\n\nTo tell you candidly whether you’re a strong fit before you submit, could you share: (a) your child’s age, (b) the start date you need (and any flexibility), and (c) the schedule you’d follow for drop-off/pick-up? If those align well, I can also suggest the fastest next step so you’re not left waiting.",

We should keep Parent_E warm, encourage a prompt application, and signal we can move quickly but won’t hold the seat long—while leaving flexibility to accept a higher-priority applicant if they apply first. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK] and gather key fit details (schedule, start date, commitment)."
