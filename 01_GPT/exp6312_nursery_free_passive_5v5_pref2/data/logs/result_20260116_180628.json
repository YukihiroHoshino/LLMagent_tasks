Because we have limited capacity, earlier applications help us evaluate fit sooner, but we don’t finalize everything immediately if we’re still waiting on key information.\n\nWhat we prioritize most:\n- Practical fit (drop-off/pick-up schedule alignment and start date)\n- Commitment/likelihood of enrolling if offered a place\n- Child’s needs and how they align with our classroom supports (e.g., routines, language needs, any accommodations)\n- Logistics (location/transport)\n\nIf you’re ready, you’re welcome to apply this round; if not, we can continue talking and you can apply next round. To help us assess fit quickly, could you share your preferred start date, your weekly schedule constraints, and anything important about your child’s needs or temperament?",

We’ll also check in with you after separation if that’s helpful.\n\n(2) Communication with families\n- Daily touchpoints at drop-off/pick-up whenever possible.\n- Regular updates on the day (highlights, meals/rest, notable moments, any concerns). We can do this via an app/message system and/or brief written notes depending on family preference.\n- Scheduled conferences/check-ins: at least termly, and more often if a child is going through a transition or needs extra support.\n- Quick responsiveness: if something comes up (sleep changes, peer conflict, separation anxiety), we’ll reach out the same day and align on a plan.\n\nVisits / observation / info session\nYes—if you’re deciding soon, we can usually arrange a short observation visit or a 15–20 minute call with the lead educator. If you tell me your availability (a couple of windows over the next 7–10 days), I’ll propose specific times.\n\nOne quick question so I can advise you accurately: are there any particular transition challenges you’re anticipating (e.g., first time in group care, separation anxiety, language needs), and what schedule are you aiming for?\n\n[TALK]",

That means:\n- Children learn through purposeful play centers and projects.\n- Educators run short, structured small-group moments (e.g., phonological awareness games, counting/shape play, fine-motor activities, story time), but we keep it developmentally appropriate and responsive rather than “worksheet-style.”\n- We use observation to plan next steps for each child (social skills, language, independence, curiosity).\n\n3) Hours + early drop-off/late pick-up\nOur standard day covers core full-day hours, and we can often accommodate early drop-off and/or late pick-up depending on current staffing and demand. If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up times and which days per week you need, I can confirm what we can offer right now.\n\n4) Transition / settling-in\nWe use a gradual settling-in plan tailored to the child:\n- Initial visit(s) with the parent/caregiver present to build familiarity\n- Short independent stays, then progressively longer sessions\n- A consistent key educator when possible, plus predictable routines\n- Regular check-ins with you during the first couple of weeks (what’s working, any worries, sleep/food/comfort items)\n\nIf Nursery_E is a strong option for you, you’re welcome to apply as soon as you feel ready—we can move quickly once we have your child’s age, start date, and preferred schedule.

In round 3, unmatched nurseries are B, C, E. My top choice is C, but C’s priority ranks me 4th (behind B, A, D), so it’s likely competitive. B ranks me 4th as well (behind A, B, C). E ranks me 1st, making it a strong safety. I have only talked to E so far and haven’t applied. Best strategy: keep E warm without committing yet, and try to elicit whether they can hold a spot briefly; do not apply this round."

We don’t require an instant decision on the same day, but because places can move fast, we typically offer a short confirmation window (e.g., 24–48 hours) once we’ve agreed the schedule works.\n\nIf you tell me (a) your child’s age, (b) ideal start date, and (c) which days + drop-off/pick-up times you need, I can confirm whether we can support early/late times and what the most realistic confirmation window would be for you.",
