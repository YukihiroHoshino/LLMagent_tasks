We’re happy to share what we focus on at Nursery_C.\n\n1) Daily routine & security: We keep a consistent rhythm (arrival, free play, small-group activities, meals, rest, outdoor time) so children know what to expect and feel secure.\n\n2) Outdoor time & physical play: We prioritize daily outdoor play whenever weather allows—gross motor development, nature exploration, and lots of movement.\n\n3) Learning/behavior approach: We use a play-based approach with clear, calm boundaries. We emphasize social-emotional skills (naming feelings, turn-taking, conflict mediation) and positive reinforcement rather than punitive discipline.\n\n4) Communication with families: We value frequent, practical updates—how the day went, meals/rest, any social-emotional notes, and quick check-ins when something needs attention. We also welcome scheduled conversations if you want deeper alignment on routines or behavior support.\n\nTo help me understand fit for your child: what age are they, and are there any key priorities (e.g., nap needs, separation anxiety, allergies, language environment, or temperament) you’d like us to accommodate? Also, are you aiming to decide soon, or still comparing a few schools this week?",
