              "thought": "Only Nursery_B remains unmatched, so to avoid ending unmatched I should apply now. Nursery_B is 4th on my true list but still acceptable. Nursery_B’s priority ranks me 4th (after A, B, C), so my acceptance depends on whether higher-priority parents are already matched elsewhere; given we’re at round 3 and Nursery_B is the only unmatched nursery, it’s likely those higher-priority parents matched to other nurseries, making me a plausible candidate. I have only talked to Nursery_B previously and have not applied yet, so applying is optimal."
