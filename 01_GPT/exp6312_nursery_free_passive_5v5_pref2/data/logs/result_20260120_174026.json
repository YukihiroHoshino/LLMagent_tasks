We add predictable structure through routines (arrival, group time, meals, rest) and short, teacher-guided activities (story, music, early literacy/numeracy through play, simple projects) so children feel secure and know what’s coming next.\n\n**Social-emotional support:** We focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking, and build independence. Teachers model calm problem-solving, use consistent expectations, and coach children through peer conflicts (e.g., “I” statements, taking space, re-trying). We also reinforce self-help skills (tidying, handwashing, putting on shoes) to build confidence.\n\n**Typical daily flow (varies by age group):**\n- Arrival & settling-in choices\n- Morning free play / learning centers\n- Short circle time (songs, story, routines)\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon small-group activity (art/sensory/early learning through play)\n- Outdoor/free play\n- Pick-up & handover\n\n**Communication with parents:**\n- Quick daily handover at drop-off/pick-up\n- Regular updates on routines (meals, nap, mood) and key moments from the day\n- Periodic check-ins to discuss development, goals, and any support strategies\nIf something notable comes up (big transition, recurring challenge, or a milestone), we proactively reach out rather than waiting.\n\nTo tailor this to your needs, could you share: (1) your preferred start month, (2) the days/hours you’re looking for, and (3) anything important for us to know about your child’s temperament or routines (sleep, separation, allergies)?
