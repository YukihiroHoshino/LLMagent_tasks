Only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched in round 3, so the market is near closure and delaying could risk ending unmatched. Nursery_E’s priority list ranks me #1, so if I apply I should be accepted and secure a placement. Since I have not applied to A yet (only TALK) and A is higher for me but may not prioritize me, the safe move is to apply to E now to lock in a match rather than gamble on A and potentially end with nothing."

Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (behind Parent_B), giving me a strong chance if I apply now.
