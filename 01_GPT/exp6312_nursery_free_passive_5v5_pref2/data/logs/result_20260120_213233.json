Children spend most learning time in guided play/learning centers (blocks, dramatic play, art, sensory, early literacy), with teachers scaffolding language, social skills, and early concepts. The “structure” shows up in consistent rhythms (arrival → meeting → centers/small group → outdoor → lunch → rest → afternoon centers/enrichment) and explicit support for self-help skills and classroom expectations.\n\n2) Hours / aftercare flexibility\nWe offer standard core-day programming with limited flexibility depending on classroom staffing and availability. Aftercare/extended-day options can be available in some cases, but it’s capacity-dependent each cycle. If you share (a) the days you need, (b) drop-off/pick-up window, and (c) preferred start date, I can tell you what we can realistically accommodate right now.\n\n3) What tends to matter most in practice when deciding among interested families\nWhen we have more interest than seats, the biggest practical factors are:\n- Schedule match and likelihood of consistent attendance (fit with our routine)\n- Home–school partnership (responsive communication and alignment on approach)\n- Ability to support the child well (allergies/medical/developmental needs—just so we plan appropriately)\n- Readiness for group care / separation context (not required; helps us support transitions)\n\nIf Nursery_B is still in your top set, I’d encourage you to submit an application once you feel comfortable—seats can move quickly, and applying is the best way for us to formally consider you. If you reply with your child’s age, temperament, and the schedule you’re aiming for, I’ll be very direct about whether we can be a strong fit this cycle.",
