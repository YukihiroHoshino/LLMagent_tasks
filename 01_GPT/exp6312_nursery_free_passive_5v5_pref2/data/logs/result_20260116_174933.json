However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_A last and is likely to pursue Nursery_E/C/D/B first, so immediate competition for Nursery_A may be limited.

Our approach emphasizes social-emotional development, language, early numeracy/literacy through hands-on activities, and lots of outdoor/gross-motor play.\n\nDrop-off/pick-up flexibility: We can accommodate a reasonable arrival window in the morning and a pick-up window in the afternoon, and we can discuss specific needs (e.g., commuting constraints) to find a workable plan.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and your ideal drop-off/pick-up times, I can confirm what we can support and suggest the best classroom fit.
