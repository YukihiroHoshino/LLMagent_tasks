We follow allergy-aware practices (clear labeling, separation where needed, and staff briefings).\n\nStaff-to-child ratio:\n- We maintain small groups with close supervision; the exact ratio depends on the age room and day, but we prioritize having enough adults to support settling-in and transitions. If you share your child’s age, I can give the precise ratio for that room.\n\nSettling-in (first 2–3 weeks):\n- Week 1: short visits with a parent/caregiver nearby, gradually increasing time; we focus on bonding with a key caregiver.\n- Week 2: longer independent stays, consistent drop-off routine, and predictable “goodbye” plan.\n- Week 3: full routine participation; we fine-tune nap/meals/comfort strategies.\nThroughout: daily check-ins at pick-up, and we can do quick mid-day updates early on if that helps. We use consistent comfort cues and never force separation abruptly—our aim is secure attachment and confidence.\n\nExtended hours / flexibility:\n- We can offer some flexibility around drop-off and pick-up windows, and may have extended-care options depending on availability. If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up times, I’ll confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise fit precisely:\n1) How old is your child, and are naps currently consistent?\n2) What hours do you need most days (and do you need occasional late pick-up)?\n\nNursery_E would be very happy to have your family—if what I’ve described aligns with what you’re looking for, I’d encourage you to consider applying to us when you’re ready.",

Nap/rest time is after lunch, with quiet alternatives available for children who do not sleep.\n- Settling-in: We use a gradual settling-in over ~1–2 weeks, starting with shorter parent/carer-supported visits and extending to independent stays as your child feels secure. We tailor pacing to the child.\n- Drop-off/pick-up: We can usually accommodate a small flexibility window around standard times; specifics depend on group staffing and your requested schedule.\n\nThat said, we have extremely limited availability and, after reviewing current demand and our enrollment priorities for this cycle, we’re not able to offer a place at Nursery_C at this time.\n\nI’m very sorry we can’t accommodate you right now, and I appreciate your interest. If you’d like, you can share your ideal start date and required hours, and we can let you know if anything changes.\n\nWarm regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
