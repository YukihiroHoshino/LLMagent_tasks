If helpful, I can share any additional information right away.\n\nThank you for considering us.",

I previously only talked to A and have not applied yet."

Next steps: please send (1) your child’s name and date of birth, (2) your preferred start date, and (3) any schedule needs/allergies or support considerations. If you’d like, we can also arrange a brief visit/intro call in the coming days—optional, but often helpful for a smooth start.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming your family to Nursery_A.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_C is on our true priority list but ranked 4th (above only Parent_E). We still have one open spot and another unmatched parent (Parent_E) who is ranked 5th for us, so accepting Parent_C now secures a better outcome than risking ending with Parent_E or unfilled. Higher-priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A) are not available/unmatched at this point, so waiting is unlikely to improve our match. Therefore accept Parent_C."
