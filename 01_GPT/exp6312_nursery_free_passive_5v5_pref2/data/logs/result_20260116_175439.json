We do not want families to rush, but if Nursery_E is a serious option, an earlier application generally improves the chance that we can finalize before the spot is taken.\n- **Sibling/alumni:** It can be a positive signal of fit/commitment, but it’s not the only deciding factor.\n- **Location/logistics:** We consider it mainly insofar as it affects reliable arrival/pickup and the child’s day-to-day experience.\n\n**Typical daily rhythm (example)**\n- Arrival & settling-in / free play\n- Morning circle (songs, calendar, language)\n- Learning centers / small-group activities (pre-literacy, math sense, art, sensory)\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon snack\n- Project time / story / music\n- Outdoor or gross-motor play\n- Pickup\n\n**Communication with parents**\n- **Daily:** quick handoff notes at pickup + brief written updates (highlights, meals/rest, anything notable).  \n- **As-needed:** we message/call promptly for anything urgent or behavior/health concerns.  \n- **Regular check-ins:** scheduled conferences and goal-setting, and we’re always open to an extra check-in if something changes at home or school.\n\nIf you’re keeping Nursery_E as a serious possibility, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you feel ready**, and include (1) your child’s age, (2) any routines that work well (sleep/food/transitions), and (3) what you most want your child to gain this year.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you more specifically: what is your child’s age, and what schedule do you need (drop-off/pick-up window and start date)?",

We avoid shame-based approaches.\n\n2) Communication with parents\n- Daily: brief verbal handoff at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily update (highlights, meals, nap, mood/any incidents). We can also message for quick logistics.\n- Ongoing: if we notice a pattern (sleep, separation anxiety, biting/hitting, toileting), we proactively schedule a check-in rather than waiting.\n- Conferences: regular conferences during the year, and additional meetings as needed.\n\nTeacher-to-child ratio\n- We staff to maintain close supervision and responsive interaction; exact ratios can vary by age group/day, but we prioritize small-group moments and consistent key caregivers so children aren’t “floating” between adults.\n\nSupporting transitions\n- Visual and verbal cues (“5-minute warning,” clean-up song), consistent routines, and clear roles for children.\n- For children who struggle, we use individualized supports (first/then language, a transition object, a helper job, or a quiet ‘reset’ spot) and coordinate with you on strategies that work at home.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be specific: how old is your child, and are there any particular transition times that are hardest right now (drop-off, clean-up, moving indoors/outdoors, nap)?
