Children who sleep do so on individual mats; children who don’t sleep can do calm activities (books, quiet table work) while we maintain a restful environment.\n• Social/emotional development: We use consistent routines, emotion-labeling, and guided peer problem-solving (turn-taking, sharing, using words). Teachers model calm conflict resolution and support children in recognizing feelings and practicing empathy.\n\nA couple quick questions to make sure we’re a great fit: what is your child’s age, and are there any routines (nap needs, allergies, separation at drop-off) you’d like us to know about?\n\nIf everything feels aligned, we’d be very happy to receive your application whenever you’re ready.",
