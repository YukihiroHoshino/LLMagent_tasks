We spend time outdoors daily (weather permitting), followed by lunch, rest/quiet time, and an afternoon mix of guided play and child-led exploration.\n\nOur approach is play-based and relationship-centered: we use play to build language, curiosity, and self-regulation, and we observe children closely to tailor activities to their interests and developmental stage. Key values we emphasize are kindness and community, independence (age-appropriate self-help skills), and positive guidance (clear boundaries with supportive coaching).\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what you’re hoping for most (e.g., more outdoor time, social development, routines, language support), I can explain how we’d support those goals.
