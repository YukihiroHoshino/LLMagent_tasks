If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (and any days that differ), I can confirm what we can support.\n\nTo see if we’re a strong match: what age is your child, and what are your top 2–3 “must-haves” (e.g., longer hours, outdoor time, language focus, gentle transitions, etc.)? If those align, you’d be very welcome to apply this round.",

Parent_D also ranks Nursery_E first but is below Parent_A in our priority. Given Parent_E likely won't apply and Parent_B may still apply to us (we are their 1st choice), the key tradeoff is waiting for Parent_B.
