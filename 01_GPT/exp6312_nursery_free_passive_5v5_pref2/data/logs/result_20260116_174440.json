Ratios follow local licensing guidelines; the exact ratio depends on the classroom/age group.

Here are the details:\n\n1) Enrollment timeline / decision timing\n- We review families on a rolling basis during the placement period, and once we’re ready to make an offer we typically ask families to confirm within a short window (usually a few days) so we can plan staffing and transitions.\n- If you’re actively comparing programs, it helps us a lot to know your decision deadline and your preferred start date.\n\n2) Waitlist (and what happens if a spot is offered elsewhere first)\n- Yes, we do maintain a waitlist.\n- If a spot is offered to another family and they decline, we move to the next family based on our admissions priorities and overall fit (e.g., schedule needs, ability to support the child well, and cohort balance).\n- If you’re on the waitlist and your circumstances change (schedule, start date), you can update us—those details matter when we consider the next offer.\n\n3) What we consider most important in an application\nWhile we don’t use a single “points” system, the main things we look at are:\n- Schedule/attendance fit (consistency is important for children settling in)\n- Family–school partnership (communication, alignment on routines/expectations)\n- The child’s needs and whether we can support them well\n- Practical logistics (start date, hours needed)\nWe do take sibling situations into account when applicable, and proximity can matter for punctuality/consistency, but the biggest driver is overall fit and our ability to support the child successfully.\n\nVisits / open house\n- We can usually arrange a short visit/meet-and-greet. If you share a couple of time windows that work for you (weekday mornings tend to be best), we’ll offer the next available slot.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can guide you accurately:\n- What age is your child and what schedule (days/hours) are you hoping for?\n- By when do you need to make a final decision?\n\nHappy to set up a visit—if Nursery_A is still in your top set, seeing the classroom often makes the comparison much clearer.",

I’m happy to share more.\n\n**Daily routine & learning approach**\nWe’re play-based and child-led, with teachers guiding small-group experiences (stories/songs, early numeracy games, art/sensory, and lots of cooperative play). A typical day looks like: arrival & free play → morning circle → centers/small groups → outdoor time → lunch → rest/quiet time → afternoon centers/outdoor → pick-up.\n\n**Social-emotional development (SEL)**\nSEL is a core focus. Teachers explicitly coach skills like naming feelings, turn-taking, conflict resolution, and empathy. We use consistent classroom routines, clear expectations, and gentle, developmentally appropriate boundaries. When conflicts come up, we support children in repairing (e.g., “What happened?” “How did that feel?” “What can we do to make it better?”).\n\n**Communication with parents**\nWe aim for proactive, predictable communication: regular updates on classroom themes and routines, timely notes on anything significant (sleep/eating/behavioral moments), and scheduled check-ins/teacher conferences. We also value quick two-way communication for day-to-day logistics.\n\n**Timeline for offers**\nWe’re in conversations now and expect to begin making initial offers after we’ve confirmed fit and scheduling across families. Because we have limited space, we may move quickly once we identify a strong match.\n\n**What we prioritize when considering families**\nWe primarily look for (1) schedule/start-date alignment, (2) a good fit with our play-based approach and partnership with parents, and (3) readiness for the classroom setting (age-appropriate independence, comfort with routines). \n\nTo give you the most accurate guidance—and to let you know whether it’s worth applying promptly—could you share:\n1) your child’s age and desired start date,\n2) the schedule you need (days/hours),\n3) any key supports/allergies/language preferences, and\n4) where Nursery_B sits on your current shortlist (top choice vs. one of several)?\n\nIf Nursery_B is a serious option for you, I can outline the quickest next steps so you don’t miss the initial offer window.",

Nursery_A and Nursery_B are higher on my list than E, but competition there is strong and my priority is low at A (last) and mid at B (4th). Given the late round and uncertainty, locking in Nursery_E is a safe strategy."
