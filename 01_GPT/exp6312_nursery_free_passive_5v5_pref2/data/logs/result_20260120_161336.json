The consistency helps children feel secure while still having freedom to explore.\n- **Learning through play:** We focus on early language, social-emotional skills, and foundational numeracy/literacy through hands-on activities (stories, music, sensory play, building, role-play). We observe and gently scaffold rather than “push” formal academics too early.\n- **Social-emotional development:** We emphasize kindness, turn-taking, and conflict-resolution with age-appropriate guidance. We work closely with families on transitions (drop-off, nap, toileting, etc.).\n- **Communication & partnership:** Regular updates on how your child is settling, what they’re enjoying, and any goals we’re working on. We value quick, practical communication.\n\n**Policies / logistics (high level)**\n- **Hours & flexibility:** We aim to be family-friendly with consistent core hours and some flexibility for drop-off/pick-up within defined windows (we can confirm exact times based on your needs).\n- **Routine & wellbeing:** Clear illness/safety policies; we prioritize a calm, clean environment and plenty of outdoor movement.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and what matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, language focus, schedule constraints), I can be more specific about how we’d support them.

In many cases, families can begin **within 1–2 weeks**, and sometimes sooner depending on the exact start day you need and staffing/settling plans for that week. If you tell me your ideal start date (and whether you need a specific day of the week), I can confirm what we can reliably offer.\n\n2) **Settling-in/transition during the first 1–2 weeks:**\nWe use a **phased-in settling plan** tailored to the child, typically:\n- **Day 1–2:** shorter sessions (e.g., 1–2 hours), focus on bonding with the key teacher and learning the routine.\n- **Day 3–5:** gradually extend to a half day, introducing lunch/rest routines as appropriate.\n- **Week 2:** move toward the full schedule, adjusting pace if the child needs more time.\n**Drop-off routine:** we aim for a **warm, predictable handoff** (brief goodbye, consistent script, comfort object if helpful). We’ll coordinate with you on what works best—some children do best with quick goodbyes; others need a short, consistent transition ritual.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and any known separation/transition needs (plus your preferred start date and hours), I can propose a concrete settling-in schedule.

Parent_E ranks Nursery_B 4th, so they may not apply unless nudged; however Nursery_B may struggle to attract B/C because both rank Nursery_B low (4th/5th). So cultivating E is prudent.

Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as 2nd choice (after E) and is our top priority, so we should try to keep capacity for a possible Parent_B application. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C last, unlikely to apply. Parent_E ranks us 1st and is applying now, which is a strong, reliable match. However, accepting now could block a higher-priority Parent_B if they apply later. Given uncertainty whether Parent_B will apply to us this round and the risk of ending unmatched, accept Parent_E to secure a match within priority list."
