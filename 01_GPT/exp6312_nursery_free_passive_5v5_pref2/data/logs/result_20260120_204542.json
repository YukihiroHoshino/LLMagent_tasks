With quota 1 still open and only Parent_C and Parent_D unmatched, I should compare: Parent_D is ranked higher (2nd) and also prefers Nursery_A highly (2nd choice), so there is a chance Parent_D may apply and I would prefer them. However, rejecting Parent_C risks ending unmatched if Parent_D matches elsewhere or doesn’t apply. Given Parent_C is acceptable and ready to enroll immediately, accepting secures a match now. I will accept and move to finalize quickly."

If helpful, I’m happy to share any additional details or documents right away (schedule needs, child profile, references). Please let me know next steps and your expected decision timeline.",

To avoid ending unmatched, I should apply to D now. Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me 3rd (after Parent_A and Parent_C). Since those parents are likely already matched elsewhere (given only A and D remain), my acceptance chances are good if I apply promptly. I’ve already sent two TALK messages without getting concrete info; time to convert interest into an application while signaling fit and flexibility."
