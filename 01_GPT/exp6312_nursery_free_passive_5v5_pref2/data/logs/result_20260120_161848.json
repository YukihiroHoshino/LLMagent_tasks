Teachers observe and scaffold language, early literacy/numeracy concepts, and social-emotional skills in small groups and 1:1 moments.\n\nA typical day looks like: arrival & free-choice centers → morning circle (songs, story, routine) → small-group/choice activities → outdoor time → lunch/snack → rest/quiet time → afternoon centers/project work → closing circle & pickup.\n\nHours/extended care: we run a standard school-day schedule and we can often accommodate early drop-off/late pickup depending on staffing and demand. If you share the hours you need, I can tell you what’s realistic this year.\n\nTransitions for new children: we do a gradual entry when possible (shorter first days, consistent caregiver handoff routines), assign a primary point teacher for the first few weeks, and use visual schedules and comfort objects to help children settle. We also communicate closely with families so we can align on strategies that work at home.\n\nWhat we especially value in incoming families is partnership—consistent attendance, clear communication, and alignment on supporting independence and kind classroom behavior.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you well:\n1) What schedule/hours (and any extended-care needs) are you hoping for?\n2) How old is your child and what’s their prior group-care experience, if any?\n3) Where does Nursery_A sit for you versus your first-choice, and are you considering applying this round/soon?\n\nHappy to share more once I understand your needs a bit better.",
