We keep the flow consistent so children quickly learn “what comes next.”\n\nFor transitions/adaptation, we use a gradual settling-in plan tailored to each child: shorter initial days if needed, a consistent key person as the main point of contact, and clear handoff routines at drop-off (same goodbye script, comfort item allowed). We also provide frequent early updates (brief notes/photos where permitted) and check in with you to adjust pacing. If a child is having a tough moment, we focus on co-regulation—staying close, naming feelings, and offering a quiet corner or familiar activity until they’re ready to rejoin.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, prior childcare experience, temperament, any routines that help at home).

We’re aiming to avoid long back-and-forth so families can plan.\n\n2) Timeline for finalizing the remaining spot: We plan to finalize the last place as soon as we have a strong fit who can commit promptly. Realistically, that could be within the next few rounds; we won’t hold the spot indefinitely without an application/clear commitment.\n\nConcrete examples for tough drop-offs (first 1–2 weeks):\n- Example A (structured handoff + predictable ritual): We set up a consistent “arrival job” (e.g., put bag away, choose a book for the key person to read, then join a small table activity). Staff uses the same short goodbye script with the caregiver, then immediately transitions the child into that job. We stay close, narrate feelings (“You’re sad—Mum will come back after rest time”), and keep the first activity calm and predictable.\n- Example B (co-regulation + gradual separation plan): If separation is very hard, we agree on a brief caregiver stay for a set time (e.g., 5–10 minutes) for a couple of days, then reduce it. When the caregiver leaves, a key staff member stays physically close (sitting nearby, offering hand-holding if the child wants), guides breathing/soothing strategies, and uses a preferred comfort item. We also follow up with you shortly after drop-off with a quick update so you’re not left worrying.\n\nTo give you an accurate answer on whether we can move immediately: could you share (a) your desired start date, (b) days/hours needed, and (c) how quickly you could decide if we confirm a place?
