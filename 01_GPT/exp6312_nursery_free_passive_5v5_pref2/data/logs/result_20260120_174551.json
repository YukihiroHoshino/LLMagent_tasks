Happy to share how we handle evaluation and timing.\n\nSelection/evaluation: we follow a clear priority order when reviewing applicants (we don’t use extra “hidden” criteria beyond eligibility/fit basics like age/required documents). If multiple families are comparable at the same priority level, we use consistent tie-breaking (e.g., application completeness/timestamp).\n\nTimeline: we typically give provisional decisions quickly after an application is submitted, but final confirmation depends on whether any higher-priority candidates apply in the same window and on families’ acceptance/withdrawal decisions in early rounds. In practice, you’ll usually know within the next few rounds whether we can confirm a placement.\n\nIf Nursery_B is a serious option for you, feel free to tell me your likely timeline for applying/deciding (e.g., “if my top choices don’t work out by round X, I’ll apply here”). That helps us coordinate expectations and avoid you waiting unnecessarily.",
