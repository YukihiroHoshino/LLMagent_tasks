We’re pleased to offer you our available spot at Nursery_A.\n\nTo finalize, please send (1) your preferred start date, (2) your weekly schedule needs (days/hours), and (3) any key pickup/drop-off constraints. We’ll then confirm the enrollment paperwork and required documents (e.g., immunization/health forms) and next steps right away.\n\nWe’re excited about the possibility of welcoming your family to Nursery_A.

With quota 1 and only Parent_C and Parent_D remaining unmatched, accepting Parent_D now secures a highly preferred match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority option. Parent_D also states readiness to accept promptly, which aligns with our rolling, single-spot process."

              "thought": "Nursery_B is on my true list but ranked last (5th). At round 4, it is the only nursery left unmatched, implying all other nurseries (including my top choices D/C/E/A) are already filled, so my only chance to avoid being unmatched is to secure Nursery_B. Given Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me 3rd (after Parent_A and Parent_B), but those parents likely matched elsewhere since only Nursery_B remains. Therefore, applying now maximizes my chance to match rather than end unmatched, and there is little strategic value in further talk given the late stage."
