We balance calm transitions with plenty of movement and play.\n\nApproach to early learning: Play-based and developmentally guided—language-rich activities, early numeracy through games, social-emotional skill building (sharing, turn-taking, self-regulation), and lots of creative exploration (art, sensory, music). We observe each child and adapt activities to their pace.\n\nStart-date flexibility: We can often accommodate a range of start dates and can discuss a gradual transition if that’s helpful (shorter first days, phased-in schedule), depending on space and your needs.\n\nTo make sure I address what matters most: what age is your child, and are you looking for full-time or part-time care?
