We keep a consistent key adult as the main point of contact, use predictable routines, and communicate daily about how the child is adjusting (sleep, eating, mood, engagement). If a child is struggling, we slow the pace and coordinate closely with the family.\n\nSelection / priority considerations:\nWhen we have more applicants than places, we mainly look at overall fit and readiness for our setting (child’s needs and how well we can support them), the family’s commitment to our routines/communication, and practical alignment (start date, attendance pattern). We also value families who show clear interest in Nursery_C.\n\nIf Nursery_C is a serious option for you, I’d be happy to hear a little about your child (age, temperament, any routines/needs) and your preferred start date—then I can tell you how well we might match and what the next step would be.",
