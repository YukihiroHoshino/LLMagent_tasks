Teachers use consistent routines, positive reinforcement, and age-appropriate conflict mediation (e.g., naming feelings, helping children ask for a turn, offering choices). We also watch for patterns (shyness, big feelings, peer dynamics) and partner with families early.\n\n**Family–school communication & involvement**: What we value most is a **collaborative, two-way relationship**—quick daily check-ins plus regular updates on learning and wellbeing. We appreciate families sharing what’s changing at home (sleep, transitions, concerns) so we can support consistency. We offer opportunities to be involved (classroom events, volunteering when possible), but we also respect busy schedules—staying connected matters more than frequency.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines or goals you have).

I already submitted a formal application earlier, so I cannot [APPLY] again. Given Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me last, repeated appeals likely haven’t changed their decision; however, with the deadline, the best move is to request a definitive ACCEPT/REJECT and offer immediate completion of any remaining requirement. Use [TALK] to avoid violating the rule about re-applying."

There are **no other requirements** (no call/visit/references/forms needed to decide).\n\nPlease reply **immediately** with the following (copy/paste is fine):\n\n**[APPLY]** We apply to Nursery_B. Start date: immediate/flexible. Days/hours: fully flexible (Mon–Fri full-time or any fixed 2–4 days as needed).

It is round 30 and Parent_D is the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an included parent. The parent continues to send [TALK] instead of [APPLY], and per rules I cannot send [ACCEPT] unless they send [APPLY]. Therefore, I should clearly state that our final decision is to offer the place contingent only on receiving an [APPLY] message, and prompt them with a copy/paste template to ensure compliance immediately."
