We focus on social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, self-regulation), language development through storytelling and conversation, and hands-on exploration. Teachers observe and scaffold—adding gentle structure when it supports children’s curiosity.\n\nKey expectations for families: reliable drop-off/pick-up, open communication, and partnership on routines (sleep/toileting, transitions). We also appreciate families participating in periodic events (e.g., conferences, classroom celebrations) and keeping us informed about any changes at home that may affect a child’s day.\n\nTo help me understand fit: what are you hoping your child gets most from nursery this year (e.g., social confidence, language, routine, outdoor play)?

Typically this includes a short initial visit with a caregiver, then progressively longer drop-offs over the first 1–2 weeks as the child builds trust.

Children who don’t sleep are supported with calm activities (books, quiet table work) without pressure.\n- **Afternoon small groups:** projects, music/movement, early literacy games, and individualized support\n- **Pick-up:** brief handover and any key notes from the day\n\n2) **Social-emotional development & early language support**\n- **Social-emotional:** we explicitly teach routines, turn-taking, problem-solving language (“Can I have a turn when you’re done?”), and emotion naming. Teachers coach in-the-moment during peer conflicts and use consistent, predictable boundaries.\n- **Classroom culture:** small-group work and cooperative play are used to build empathy and friendship skills.\n- **Early language:** daily read-alouds, songs/rhymes, rich conversation during play, and targeted small-group activities (vocabulary, storytelling, listening games). If a child needs extra support, we differentiate with visual cues, repetition, and one-to-one scaffolding.\n\n3) **Communication with parents (updates / conferences)**\n- **Daily:** quick pick-up handover plus brief notes on anything important (mood, eating, rest, notable moments).\n- **Ongoing updates:** regular photo/learning highlights and what we’re working on in class.\n- **Conferences/check-ins:** scheduled parent-teacher check-ins, and we’re available for additional meetings if something comes up.\n\n4) **Exact application steps & decision timeline**\nIf you decide to move forward:\n1) **Submit application form** (I can send it immediately).\n2) **Short meet-and-greet/visit** (recommended; helps confirm fit for your child).\n3) **Decision/offer:** once we have your application + basic details, we typically confirm next steps quickly and issue an offer as soon as we can based on availability.\n\nTo give you the most accurate timeline and confirm fit, could you share:\n- Your child’s **age/date of birth**\n- Preferred **start date**\n- Needed schedule (full-day/half-day; days per week)\n\nIf you’d like, I can also outline what a first week transition plan would look like at Nursery_E based on your child’s temperament and prior childcare experience.

When we do have to make choices, we prioritize (1) overall fit with our routines and communication style, (2) readiness for a gradual/consistent settling-in plan if needed, and (3) families who are responsive and collaborative during the first weeks (that’s when children benefit most from tight home–school alignment).\n\n**Onboarding + communication in the first month:** We use a “key-person” approach—your child is paired with a primary educator who is the main point of contact. In weeks 1–2 we typically do brief daily check-ins at drop-off/pick-up plus a short written update on how the day went (mood, eating, toileting, rest, play/peer interactions). By weeks 3–4, once routines stabilize, we move to regular weekly learning/routine updates and as-needed check-ins. If anything is off (sleep, separation, biting/hitting, etc.) we’ll message/call the same day and align on a plan.\n\n**Class size/ratio:** This depends on your child’s age band and room. Could you share your child’s age (and start date you’re aiming for)? I’ll reply with the exact room placement and the current class size and teacher coverage for that group.\n\nIf Nursery_C is staying on your shortlist, you’re very welcome to apply—applications help us move from “exploring” to holding a place while we confirm fit and timing.",
