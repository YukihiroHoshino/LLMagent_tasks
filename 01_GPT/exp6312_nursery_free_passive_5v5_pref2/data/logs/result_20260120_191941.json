Children who don’t sleep can do quiet activities (books, puzzles) so the room stays restful for everyone.\n\n**Meals**\n- We maintain clear routines for handwashing, seating, and pacing.\n- We can accommodate common dietary needs/allergies with advance notice; please share any restrictions so we can confirm specifics.\n\n**Gradual transition / shorter first days**\n- Yes—**we strongly support gradual transitions**. Many new children start with **shorter first days** and build up over the first 1–2 weeks, coordinated with you based on your child’s temperament and prior childcare experience.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: **your child’s age**, any **nap habits** (e.g., usually naps/doesn’t nap), and any **dietary needs**—I can tailor the plan and confirm the right classroom setup.
