Competition: Parent_A and Parent_D also rank Nursery_E first, but Nursery_E prioritizes me over both. Parent_E is the main risk since Nursery_E ranks them first and they rank Nursery_E last, so they likely won’t apply early. Best move is to apply immediately to lock in the match."

Welcome to our community—our admissions team will follow up with the next steps and enrollment details shortly.",
              "thought": "Parent_B ranks 2nd on Nursery_E’s true priority list (only behind Parent_E), so accepting is highly desirable. Parent_B also ranks Nursery_E as first choice and commits to enroll, making the match stable and reducing risk of losing them to another nursery. With quota 1, accepting now secures a top-tier outcome; waiting for Parent_E is risky because Parent_E prefers Nursery_E last and is unlikely to apply. Therefore accept."

Other parents’ top choices are mostly Nursery_E or Nursery_C, so early commitment to Nursery_D is optimal. No prior interactions, so I should apply now and emphasize fit and readiness to enroll."

I have strong chances at higher-ranked options: at Nursery_B I am top priority; at Nursery_D I am top priority; at Nursery_E I am 3rd behind Parent_E and Parent_B (both rank E first), so E may be hard but worth trying in later rounds.
