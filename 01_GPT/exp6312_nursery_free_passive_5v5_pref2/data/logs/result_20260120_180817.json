We keep whole-group “sit time” brief and age-appropriate.\n\n**Social-emotional support:** We explicitly teach routines, turn-taking, and emotion-labeling through modeling, stories, and role-play. Staff use consistent, calm boundaries and help children practice problem-solving (“what can we do instead?”). We also watch for peer dynamics and support friendship-building with structured cooperative games and guided conflict resolution.\n\n**Settling-in period:** We typically do a gradual transition over the first 1–2 weeks, tailored to the child. Commonly this starts with a short stay with a parent nearby, then brief independent time, building up to the full session. We’ll agree a plan with you and adjust based on how your child is coping.\n\n**Parent communication & involvement:** We prefer proactive, two-way communication. You can expect regular updates (brief daily notes/at-pickup highlights plus periodic developmental check-ins). For anything significant (sleep, eating, separation, behavior patterns), we’ll message/call promptly. We welcome parent involvement in agreed ways (e.g., sharing cultural traditions, reading a story, or joining special events), but it’s always optional.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what start date and weekly schedule are you aiming for, and has your child been in group care before?
