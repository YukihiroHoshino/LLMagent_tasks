After lunch we have a **rest/nap window**, with quiet alternatives for children who don’t sleep.\n\n**Supporting new children (first weeks)**\nWe use a gradual settling-in plan where possible: consistent key caregivers, clear goodbye routines, and close observation of what helps your child regulate (comfort items, preferred activities, pacing transitions). We coordinate with you on sleep, eating, and separation strategies, and we adjust expectations during the first couple of weeks so children can build trust and confidence.\n\n**Communication with parents**\nWe do quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, and provide regular written/photo updates. We’ll always call if anything urgent comes up. We also offer scheduled conferences/checkpoints during the year (and can arrange an earlier check-in for new starters if helpful).\n\n**What we prioritize in applications**\nWe primarily follow our **published priority order**. Beyond that, we look for “fit” factors that support a smooth start: clear, responsive communication from caregivers; alignment with a consistent routine; and complete information on allergies/medical needs, language needs, and any supports already in place.\n\nIf you’re ready to apply promptly, that’s the best next step.
