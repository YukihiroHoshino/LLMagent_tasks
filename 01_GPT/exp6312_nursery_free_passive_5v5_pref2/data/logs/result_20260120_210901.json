We prioritize a long block of child-led play each day, and we also include brief, age-appropriate structured moments for routine and confidence-building.\n\nPlay-based vs. structured: Our approach is primarily play-based, with teachers setting up “invitations to play” and learning centers that build language, social skills, and early concepts. Structured activities are kept short and flexible, and we differentiate based on each child’s readiness.\n\nTeacher/child ratios: We keep groups small and aim for close supervision and responsive interaction throughout the day. I can share the exact ratio by age group if you tell me your child’s age for next year.\n\nKey policies: We offer a consistent daily schedule, regular outdoor time (weather permitting), and we support families with clear communication on meals/snacks, allergies, and pick-up/drop-off routines. If you share your preferred hours and any dietary/allergy needs, I can confirm how we’d accommodate them.\n\nTours/open house: Yes— we can arrange a short tour/visit. Please share a few time windows that work for you (weekday mornings/early afternoons tend to be best), and I’ll propose specific slots.\n\nIf Nursery_A feels like a good fit after the tour, you’re welcome to submit an application—our places are limited, so earlier applications are easier for us to process.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can tailor details: (1) your child’s age and start month, and (2) any particular priorities (e.g., outdoor time, language support, nap schedule)?",
