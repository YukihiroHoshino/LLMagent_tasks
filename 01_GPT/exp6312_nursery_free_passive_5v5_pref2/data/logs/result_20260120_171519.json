However, Nursery_A’s priority list puts me last, so my chance is low if higher-priority parents apply.

Typically: short visits with a parent present, then brief separations that slowly increase as your child shows readiness.\n- We assign a key person to help your child build a secure attachment and maintain consistent routines.\n- We provide daily updates early on (mood, eating, sleep, comfort strategies) and coordinate closely with you on what works at home.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and any specific needs (sleep, allergies, language, separation anxiety), I can explain how we’d tailor the settling-in plan.

If we receive a complete application and it’s a strong fit, we can make an offer quickly (often within 24–48 hours). We do have one remaining place and it may be filled this round depending on applications we receive, so if Nursery_C is a top choice for you, applying sooner is the safest way to stay in consideration.\n\n(2) What we prioritize: We follow our published priority order when multiple families apply for the same place. In general, the biggest drivers are:\n- Fit with our program and ability to meet the child’s needs (e.g., allergies/medical needs we can safely support)\n- Start-date alignment and schedule compatibility\n- Then our priority order among applicants (we do not require sibling status, but if it’s part of a family’s circumstances we take it into account only insofar as it aligns with our stated priority list and operational constraints)\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing your child’s age and your ideal start date/schedule, I can confirm whether anything would be a constraint.
