We emphasize social-emotional development, early language, and independence through predictable transitions.\n\nWhat we value most in families:\n- Communication: quick, respectful check-ins about routines, sleep, allergies, or big changes at home.\n- Partnership: aligning on gentle boundaries and supporting children’s independence.\n- Reliability: consistent schedule and timely updates if plans change.\n\nWe can be reasonably flexible on occasional schedule needs, but consistency is best for children—so we try to plan changes in advance when possible.\n\nIf this sounds like a good fit, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—our available spot is limited this cycle.

A brief family meeting (and if appropriate, a short child visit) helps us assess fit.\n\n**Timeline / placements:** Because we have limited capacity (one place), we review applications as they come in and aim to confirm placements shortly after meeting families. If you’re considering applying, I recommend doing so sooner rather than later so we can schedule a conversation promptly.\n\nTo help me advise on availability and fit: what start month are you targeting, your child’s age, and what matters most to your family (hours, pedagogy, language environment, outdoor time, etc.)?",
