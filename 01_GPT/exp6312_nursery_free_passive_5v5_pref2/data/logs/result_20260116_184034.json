Teachers observe and scaffold skills (language, social-emotional, independence) and communicate progress with concrete examples.\n\n**Transitions & first weeks:**\nWe use a gradual-settling approach where possible (shorter initial stays, consistent drop-off routine), a predictable daily schedule posted in the classroom, and key-person support so your child has a primary teacher for attachment and comfort. We also use simple transition cues (songs, visual prompts) to make changes between activities smooth.\n\n**Parent communication:**\nDuring the first few weeks, we prioritize frequent updates—brief check-ins at drop-off/pick-up and a quick message/photo update when appropriate. If a child is having a tough separation, we’ll proactively reach out once they’ve settled and share what helped.\n\n**Key decision dates:**\nWe’re making decisions on a rolling basis as conversations progress, and once we receive an application we respond promptly.\n\nA couple quick questions to make sure I address what matters most to you: What age is your child, and are there any specific goals or concerns (e.g., separation anxiety, nap routine, language support) you’d like us to plan for?\n\n[TALK]",
