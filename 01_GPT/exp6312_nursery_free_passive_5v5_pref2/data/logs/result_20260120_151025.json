We balance child-led exploration with gentle teacher-guided activities.\n\nSocial-emotional development: We focus on building secure relationships with consistent key staff, coaching children through emotions (naming feelings, calming strategies), and practicing turn-taking/problem-solving during play. We use positive guidance and clear, consistent boundaries.\n\nHours/flexibility: We offer standard core hours and can usually accommodate extended care depending on availability. If you share the hours you need (drop-off/pick-up window), I can tell you what’s realistic.\n\nSelection/priority factors: We follow our priority order and also look for overall fit—e.g., alignment with our routines/approach, clear communication with families, and practical schedule compatibility.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise better: your child’s age and start date, and what hours you’re aiming for?

We’d be happy to offer you our open spot.\n\nNext steps to finalize:\n1) Please confirm your preferred start date and schedule (full-time/part-time, days, and typical drop-off/pick-up times).\n2) Child details: age/date of birth, any allergies/medical needs, and any learning/support considerations.\n3) We’ll send our enrollment packet (registration form, emergency contacts, permissions, and health/immunization requirements). If you share the best email address, we can send it today.\n\nIf you’re ready, we can also schedule a brief 10–15 minute call this week to align on transition plans and routines.\n\nWhat start date are you aiming for, and what email should we use for the documents?",
              "thought": "Parent_D is #2 on Nursery_A’s true priority list (very desirable). We have 1 remaining spot and no current match. Accepting Parent_D secures a high-priority match immediately and avoids the risk of losing them to their higher-ranked choice Nursery_E (their #1) or other options in later rounds. Parent_B (#1 for us) is already matched out of the remaining pool, so Parent_D is effectively our best available option. Therefore, accept and move quickly while requesting essential onboarding details."

Nursery_E prioritizes me first, but Nursery_E is already matched (not available). Remaining nurseries are A, B, C. If Parent_B fails at E, they may go to C (their 2nd), and Nursery_C ranks them 1st, so I could lose C if I delay.
