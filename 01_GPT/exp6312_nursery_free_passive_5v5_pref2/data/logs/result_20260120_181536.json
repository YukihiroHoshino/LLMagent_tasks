Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C, so they may not apply to E or may get C, reducing competition. Other parents who like E: Parent_A (E top) but E ranks them #3; Parent_D (E top) but E ranks them #4; Parent_C ranks E third and E ranks them last. Given E is available and I’m highly ranked, I should apply now to secure the match rather than risk Parent_A/Parent_D applying in later rounds."
