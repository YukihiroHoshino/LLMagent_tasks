Afternoons include small-group activities (early language, sensory play, art, music, and practical life skills) and plenty of outdoor time, followed by pickup.\n\nApproach to learning/play: We’re play-based and developmentally guided. Teachers set up “invitations to play” (e.g., sensory trays, building/loose parts, role play, early literacy corners) and then extend children’s interests with gentle scaffolding—encouraging communication, cooperation, and independence. We focus on social-emotional development, routines, and positive behavior support.\n\nKey policies/communication: We prioritize safety and consistency (clear drop-off/pick-up procedures, health guidance for illness, and supervised transitions). We communicate regularly with families about routines, progress, and any concerns, and we aim for a strong home–school partnership.\n\nTo help assess fit: what are your main priorities (e.g., outdoor time, structure vs. flexibility, language focus, proximity/hours)? And what age group is your child? If Nursery_C sounds aligned, I’d be glad to answer specifics and you’re welcome to apply when ready.",

I value a warm, structured environment and consistent family–school communication, and I’m very willing to partner closely with teachers to support my child’s social-emotional growth and daily routines. If there’s any specific information you’d like from us (schedule needs, temperament, family involvement), I’m happy to provide it.",

At round 3, only Nursery_B and Nursery_E remain unmatched, implying I likely did not secure C/A/D earlier. I have top priority at Nursery_E (they rank Parent_E first), so applying here should be accepted and guarantees a match. Waiting to try Nursery_B is risky because Nursery_B ranks me 4th (behind A, B, C), so I could be rejected if any of those parents end up unmatched and apply. Therefore, to maximize the chance of a guaranteed acceptable match, I should apply to Nursery_E now."
