We use outdoor time for gross-motor play and nature-based exploration.\n\nKey policies (high level):\n- Hours: We offer a consistent daily schedule; exact start/end times can be confirmed based on the track you’re considering.\n- Meals: Families typically provide packed meals/snacks (we can share guidelines and allergy policies).\n- Potty training: We support children at different stages. Fully trained is not always required at entry, but we do look for readiness and a clear plan/consistency between home and school.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applicants: With a single spot, we focus on overall fit—family alignment with our routines/values, the child’s readiness for a group setting, and strong home–school communication/attendance reliability.

That said, we also try to keep some flexibility for a few rounds while we learn which families are seriously interested and confirm schedule/start-date fit.\n\nIf the spot is filled, we don’t run a formal ranked “waitlist,” but we do keep notes on families who are a strong fit and can reach back out if circumstances change (e.g., another family accepts elsewhere). Late applications can absolutely still be considered if we haven’t finalized a match yet.\n\nIf you’d like a more concrete sense of likelihood for your family, could you share your preferred start date and weekly schedule (days/hours), plus any needs we should plan for? If those align well, applying sooner rather than later is generally advantageous.\n",

So it can move quickly, but we don’t want to rush a decision without enough information.\n\nWhen comparing applicants, the biggest factors tend to be:\n- Schedule/start-date fit (whether your needed days/hours align well with our available spot)\n- Child’s readiness for a group setting and how our environment matches their temperament\n- Family alignment with our routines/values and reliability around attendance/communication\n- Any allergies/developmental/medical needs and whether we can support them well\n\nIf you’re ready, I’d suggest a quick check on a few points so I can tell you candidly whether it looks like a strong match before you submit:\n1) Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience?\n2) Ideal start date and the days/hours you need?\n3) Any allergies or support needs we should plan for?\n\nIf those align well, submitting promptly is absolutely helpful given the single opening.
