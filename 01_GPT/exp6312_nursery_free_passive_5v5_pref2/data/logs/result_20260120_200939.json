              "message": "Hello Parent_E—thank you for the thoughtful questions. I’m very happy to stay closely in touch, and I’ll answer each point clearly.\n\n1) Separation anxiety / settling-in (first 2–3 weeks)\n- Gradual transition plan: we typically start with shorter days (or a shorter first week) and extend as your child’s comfort grows.\n- Key-person approach: one primary educator is assigned so your child has a consistent “safe base” adult.\n- Predictable goodbye routine: we support a calm, consistent drop-off ritual (brief, confident, same steps each day). We’ll guide you on wording and timing so goodbyes don’t become prolonged.\n- Comfort strategies: comfort item allowed; we use visual cues, soothing activities on arrival, and we validate feelings while redirecting to engaging play.\n- If distress persists: we adjust the plan quickly (e.g., timing of drop-off, shorter separations, added check-ins) and coordinate with you so home and nursery responses are aligned.\n\n2) Naps + outdoor play\n- Naps/rest: we follow age-appropriate routines and each child’s individual sleep needs. We provide a calm rest environment and don’t force sleep—children who don’t sleep can do quiet rest/activities. We coordinate with your home nap schedule as much as possible, especially during the settling-in period.\n- Outdoor play: we aim for outdoor time daily (weather permitting). Outdoor play is a core part of our day for regulation, confidence, and social play. We adapt intensity and duration to the child’s age and temperament, and we’re mindful of transitions for children who find them challenging.\n\n3) Day-to-day communication\n- Daily handover at drop-off/pick-up: quick, practical updates (mood, appetite, sleep, highlights, any concerns).\n- Ongoing updates: we can provide brief same-day notes/messages as needed during the settling-in phase, especially if separation is hard.\n- Regular check-ins: we proactively schedule a short check-in after the first week or two to review how the plan is working and adjust.\n\nTo tailor this to your child and help you decide confidently, could you share: your child’s age, typical nap pattern, and any specific triggers you’ve seen with separation? Also, what’s your decision timeline and preferred start date? If Nursery_E becomes a front-runner, I’d encourage you to submit an application so we can seriously consider you for our available place.",
