We balance gross-motor play with nature exploration.\n• Nap/rest: After lunch we have a quiet rest period. Children who don’t sleep can do calm activities (books, quiet table work) so everyone’s needs are respected.\n• Social-emotional development: We use consistent classroom routines, emotion labeling, and gentle conflict coaching (e.g., turn-taking language, guided problem-solving).
