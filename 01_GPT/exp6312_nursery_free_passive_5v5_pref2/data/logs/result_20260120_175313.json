We use consistent classroom expectations and gentle, clear boundaries.\n\nWhat we look for in families: strong partnership and communication—sharing your child’s temperament, any routines that help them feel safe, how you approach limits at home, and anything you’d like us to know about separation, friendships, or big transitions. Reliability with drop-off/pick-up routines and openness to collaborating with teachers are also important.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, personality, what helps when they’re upset, and what you’re hoping for socially this year), and I can explain how we’d support them here.",

When a teacher is out, we use familiar internal cover where possible rather than rotating new faces.\n\n2) **Separation anxiety / transition in the first weeks**\n- We use a **gradual settling-in plan** when families want it (shorter days at first, then building up), and we identify a **key person** who is the main attachment figure for your child.\n- We agree on a simple, consistent **goodbye routine** (brief, predictable, calm). We’ll coach you on what tends to help and what can unintentionally prolong distress.\n- In the first 1–2 weeks, we proactively share how your child is doing (eating, play engagement, comfort strategies that work) and we adjust supports quickly—comfort object, visual schedule, “job” on arrival, and targeted teacher support at drop-off.\n\n3) **Communication with parents**\n- **Daily touchpoints** at drop-off/pick-up plus brief notes on key items (mood, meals, nap, notable moments).\n- **Scheduled check-ins** early in the settling period if needed, and regular parent-teacher conferences to review development and goals.\n- We’re very open to collaborating—if something changes at home (sleep, new sibling, travel), we like to know so we can support your child smoothly.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what age is your child, and what are the top 2–3 things you’re prioritizing in a nursery (e.g., warmth/attachment, structure, outdoor time, early literacy, flexibility)? Also, which other nurseries are you comparing most closely? If Nursery_C is in serious consideration, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you feel ready**, since places can move quickly once applications start.\n",
