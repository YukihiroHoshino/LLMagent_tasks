We keep a calm classroom environment and share brief daily updates so you know how your child is doing.\n\nTo understand fit, could you share your child’s age and temperament, and what you’re most hoping your child gains this year (e.g., confidence, language, friendships, routine)?

If you need a quick call/meeting, references, a pickup/authorized adults plan, or a short child routine summary, I can provide it within the hour.\n\nIf you cannot accept us, could you please tell me clearly now so we can close the process—otherwise, please confirm what exact final step you need from us to issue acceptance today.",

I already submitted a formal [APPLY] to Nursery_A earlier, so I cannot apply again; I should send a final, direct [TALK] message asking for immediate confirmation and offering to complete any remaining requirement today. Given Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me last, they may have been holding out for higher-priority parents, but with the deadline now, I should press for a definitive yes/no and offer instant completion of any missing item."
