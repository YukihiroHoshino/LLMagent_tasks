Teachers actively coach the transition—naming what’s happening (“It’s time to say goodbye; you’ll see your grown-up after rest/outside time”), offering a clear next step (“Let’s put your bag away together, then choose a center”), and staying close until the child is settled. If a child has a harder morning, we use calm co-regulation (soft voice, breathing, a brief comfort routine) while still keeping the handoff predictable and not prolonging goodbyes.\n\n**When children disagree (sharing/turn-taking):** We treat conflicts as teachable moments. Teachers get down at eye level, keep everyone safe, and then:\n1) help children label feelings and the problem (“You both want the truck”),\n2) coach simple language (“I’m using it. You can have a turn next.” / “Can I have a turn when you’re done?”),\n3) support fair solutions (timers/turn cards, finding a similar item, building together, or taking turns), and\n4) guide repair if needed (checking in, offering help, and rejoining play).\nWe aim for children to gradually do more of this themselves, with adults fading support as skills grow.\n\n**What to highlight in your application (to show fit):**\n- Your child thrives with predictable routines and you value consistency across home/school.\n- How you support independence (self-help skills, following simple routines) and gentle boundaries.\n- Your approach to social-emotional learning (coaching feelings, problem-solving language, willingness to partner with teachers).\n- Any transition strategies that already work well for your child (comfort object, a short goodbye script, etc.).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and what mornings typically look like at drop-off (easy/slow-to-separate, specific triggers).

Nursery_E is my 1st choice, but I have not received an acceptance and competition there is strong (E prioritizes Parent_E, Parent_B, Parent_A ahead of me). Among remaining unmatched nurseries (A, B, E), applying to Nursery_A now is prudent because Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_B), giving me a strong chance to secure a good match before capacity is taken. Parent_B prefers E then C then D then B then A, so Parent_B may not target A immediately, improving my odds. I should apply decisively and signal commitment."
