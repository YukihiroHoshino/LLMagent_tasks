We observe children closely and tailor activities to their interests and development.\n\nKey policies: we prioritize a safe, respectful environment, clear drop-off/pick-up procedures, and consistent communication with families about routines and progress.

We focus on social-emotional learning and communication—helping children name feelings, take turns, and build independence.\n\nFor settling in, we use a gradual transition plan: short initial visits with a caregiver if helpful, a consistent key-person teacher for the first weeks, and a clear goodbye routine. We also share daily updates early on so you can see how your child is adjusting, and we adapt pacing based on the child’s comfort.\n\nTo see if we’re a good fit: what age is your child, and what matters most for you right now (e.g., gentle transition, outdoor time, structure vs. flexibility, language support)?
