However, Nursery_A’s priority ranks Parent_B highest and me (Parent_D) second, meaning I have a good acceptance chance if I apply. Since Nursery_E is my top choice but likely highly contested (Parent_A and Parent_B also rank it first; Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E then Parent_B then Parent_A then me), I should secure a high-probability match at Nursery_A rather than risk losing out later. No prior interactions, round 1, so applying now is optimal."

With quota 1 and no existing match, accepting now secures a high-priority parent and avoids the risk of losing them to a higher-ranked nursery in their preferences (they rank Nursery_E first).
