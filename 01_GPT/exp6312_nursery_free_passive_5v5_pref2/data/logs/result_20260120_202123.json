Within that structure, we follow children’s interests and focus on language, early numeracy, and problem-solving through hands-on play.\n\n2) Social-emotional growth: We explicitly teach skills like naming feelings, turn-taking, and conflict resolution. Staff use calm coaching, consistent expectations, and positive reinforcement. We also work closely with families if a child needs extra support with regulation or peer relationships.\n\n3) Strong parent communication: You can expect brief daily updates (how the day went, meals/rest, notable moments) and more detailed check-ins as needed. We also schedule regular conferences and welcome quick messages to align on goals.\n\nFor transitions/new children, we use a gradual entry plan when possible (shorter initial days), a consistent key-person approach, and familiar routines/visual cues to help children settle in.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, prior group-care experience, temperament, any transition concerns).

Since I already initiated a TALK last round and haven’t received any info yet, I should continue TALK to gather details and signal interest, while keeping flexibility to apply to Nursery_C/Nursery_A when paired. I will lightly indicate D is a top option and ask for their admissions/fit criteria to assess chances."

Staff will support you with a plan so drop-offs don’t stretch out.\n- **Comfort & regulation supports:** familiar object from home if helpful, visual cues, and co-regulation strategies (quiet corner, sensory tools, movement breaks).\n\n**Communication with parents:**\n- **Daily touchpoints** at pick-up and/or a short written update (meals, rest, mood, highlights).\n- **Proactive check-ins** during the first 2–3 weeks (what’s working, what’s hard, how we’ll adjust).\n- We welcome quick messages so home and school can stay aligned on routines (sleep, toileting, separation anxiety, etc.).\n\n**Best-fit qualities/family situations:**\n- Families who value **predictable routines** and are comfortable partnering with us on consistent boundaries.\n- Families who are open to **collaborative problem-solving** (e.g., agreeing on a shared drop-off plan, consistent responses to biting/hitting, toileting support).\n- Children often do well when caregivers can support a **steady transition plan** (even if it’s brief—consistency matters more than perfection).\n\n**How to present your application well:**\nIf/when you apply, it helps to include:\n- your child’s age and prior care experience,\n- temperament (slow-to-warm vs. eager-to-join),\n- any current transition challenges (drop-off, sleep, toileting, separation),\n- what routines work at home and what you’d like us to reinforce.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, what is your child’s age and how do they typically handle separations/new settings? That will help me suggest a realistic first-week plan tailored to your family.",

With quota 1 and no matches yet, we should keep Parent_E engaged but not commit unless they apply and we judge timing; however they have not applied this round, so we respond with TALK, provide details, and ask targeted questions to assess fit and encourage a strong application while preserving flexibility for higher-priority parents."

Parent_A prefers E>B>D and likely already matched elsewhere; Parent_D prefers E>A>B>D and also likely matched elsewhere.
