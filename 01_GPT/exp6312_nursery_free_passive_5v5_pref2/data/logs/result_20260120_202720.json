When applicable, factors like sibling connection and proximity/logistics can matter. Application timing can help in the sense that we can only hold one spot—so applying when you’re ready is important.\n\nIf Nursery_C is a serious option for you this round, I’d be happy to hear what draws you to our program (schedule needs, location, any sibling connection, and what you’re looking for developmentally). That will help ensure we’re aligned if you choose to submit an [APPLY].",
