Based on our current availability and priorities, we’re happy to offer you the available place.\n\nTo finalize, please reply with:\n1) your preferred start date (and any flexibility),\n2) the schedule you need (days + drop-off/pick-up windows), and\n3) confirmation you can complete enrollment paperwork within 24 hours.\n\nOnce we have that, we’ll send the enrollment steps immediately.",

Parent_E ranks us first and is applying now, ready to confirm immediately. With quota 1 and no current match, accepting Parent_E secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with Parent_C or staying empty."
