Since this is round 30 (the final round), I want to be fully clear and make this easy: Nursery_C is one of my top choices, and if you offer me the available place, I will confirm enrollment immediately today and complete any required paperwork right away.\n\nCan you please provide your final decision now (accept/reject)? If there is any single missing document or detail needed to finalize an acceptance, please tell me exactly what it is and I will send it immediately.",

I already submitted a formal [APPLY] earlier, but Nursery_C has not accepted and we are now at the final round (30) with Nursery_C the only unmatched nursery. Since I cannot re-apply under the rules, the best move is a final [TALK] message that makes an immediate-commitment offer and requests a definitive accept/reject now, emphasizing that no further rounds remain."

The **single missing step** is your **[APPLY]** submission. If you are able to send **[APPLY] right away**, please include:\n1) preferred start date (and any flexibility),\n2) schedule needs (full-time/part-time, days),\n3) any priority/eligibility documentation (if applicable).\n\nOnce we receive that **[APPLY]**, we will confirm immediately.",

It is the final round and no other parents remain unmatched, so leaving the seat empty is the only alternative. Parent_C has repeatedly refused to send [APPLY] and is again sending [TALK]; under the rules I cannot finalize without an [APPLY]. Best action is to give a clear, final instruction: acceptance is ready immediately upon receiving [APPLY] now, and specify the only required details. Use [TALK] tag."
