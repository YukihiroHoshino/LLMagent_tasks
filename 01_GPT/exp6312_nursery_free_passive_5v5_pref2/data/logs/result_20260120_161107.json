We prioritize predictable transitions and plenty of child-led play.\n\nOutdoor time: We aim for outdoor play every day (weather permitting), typically at least one substantial outdoor block, and often a shorter second one.\n\nTeacher–child ratio: We keep groups small with a lead teacher and supporting staff so children get frequent 1:1 attention as well as guided peer interaction. (If you share your child’s age, I can give the exact classroom ratio for that group.)\n\nSocial-emotional development: We explicitly teach routines for sharing, turn-taking, and problem-solving, and we use calm-down strategies (labeling feelings, breathing, cozy corner). Teachers coach children through conflicts rather than simply separating them, and we communicate regularly with families about what works for each child.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what you’re most looking for (e.g., gentle transition support, language development, more outdoor focus), I can describe the specific classroom that would be the best fit.

We’ll then send our short enrollment form and document checklist (ID, immunization/health record as applicable, and emergency contacts) so we can confirm everything promptly.\n\nWe’re excited about the possibility of welcoming your family to Nursery_C.",
