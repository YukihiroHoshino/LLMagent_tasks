We use visual cues and simple routines (e.g., “first/then” language) to support independence and reduce anxiety.\n\nFor transitions, we prepare children ahead of time (warnings before changes, songs/rituals for clean-up and moving between areas) and we individualize support for children who need extra reassurance—often pairing them with a familiar adult and a consistent transition job (line leader, helper) to build confidence.\n\nOn social-emotional development, we explicitly teach skills like taking turns, naming feelings, and problem-solving with peers. Staff coach children through conflicts calmly (acknowledge feelings, restate the problem, support generating solutions) rather than simply separating them, and we reinforce positive peer interactions throughout the day.\n\nFor communication with families, we prioritize clarity and consistency—regular updates on routines and classroom themes, and we proactively reach out if a child is having a tricky transition so we can partner with you on a plan.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child’s age and any specific transition (morning drop-off, separating, new peers) you’re most focused on—so I can share exactly how we’d support them here.",

If you tell me the exact times you’d need (days per week + earliest drop-off / latest pick-up), I can confirm what’s available.\n\n2) Social-emotional support & transitions: We use a consistent, predictable arrival routine and a gradual separation approach. Teachers greet each child, help them choose a “first activity,” and stay close during the handoff. We coach families on a short, confident goodbye, and we support children with naming feelings, comfort strategies, and connection-building (buddy play, small-group games, and guided conflict resolution). We also communicate after drop-off if a child is having a tough transition so you’re not left wondering.\n\nVisits: We can schedule a tour/visit—weekday mornings tend to be best (you’ll see circle time + learning centers), or early afternoon for a calmer view of the classroom. Share a couple time windows that work for you this week or next, and I’ll propose a specific slot.\n\nAlso, to make sure we’re a fit: what age is your child, and what schedule (full days vs. part-time) are you considering?",

              "thought": "Nursery_B true priority: A > B > C > E > D. Target is Parent_E (4th), acceptable but not top. Remaining unmatched parents: A, D, E. Quota 1. If I reject E, I may try for A, but Parent_A ranks Nursery_B as 2nd behind Nursery_E, so A may end up at E if E accepts them; also other nurseries may compete for A. Accepting E now secures a match with an acceptable parent rather than risking ending unmatched or with lower-ranked D (last on my list). Parent_E shows strong commitment and fit, reducing risk. Therefore accept."

Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Parent_B). Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_E, and Parent_A’s top choice is Nursery_E as well, so Parent_B may not apply to A unless rejected at E.
