At Nursery_D we value families who are collaborative and communicative, align with our child-centered, play-based approach, and can partner with us on consistent routines (drop-off/pick-up, attendance, and supporting social-emotional growth at home). We also look for a good match between a child’s needs/temperament and our classroom structure.\n\nYou’re absolutely welcome to apply this cycle, and we will give your application full consideration. Because placements depend on the overall pool and our limited capacity, I can’t promise an outcome at this stage—but if you share a bit about your child (age, prior group-care experience, any supports needed) and what you’re hoping for in a nursery, I can tell you more specifically how strong the fit might be and what next steps would look like.",

When we have multiple interested families, we’ll generally move forward with those who are highest in that order and who confirm promptly.\n\nOn timing: we do expect our single spot to be competitive and potentially fill quickly, since we’re hearing interest early this round.

Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C, so they are likely to remain interested; we can reject now to preserve capacity and potentially revisit later if unmatched (though no formal waitlist mechanism exists). Given the early round and strong chance higher-priority parents may approach us (Parent_B ranks us 2nd; Parent_C ranks us 2nd; Parent_A/D rank us last), we should hold out for Parent_B first.

Staff model calm language, use consistent boundaries, and support children in building independence and empathy through play-based group activities.\n\n**Communication with families:** we prioritize clear, frequent updates—brief daily notes at pick-up (or via message), plus periodic check-ins as needed.
