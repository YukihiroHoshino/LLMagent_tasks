We balance child-led exploration with gentle structure so children feel secure and engaged.\n\nTeacher–child ratio: We staff to maintain close supervision and warm interaction throughout the day, with a consistent key-teacher assigned to each child so families have a clear point of contact.\n\nSettling-in approach: We use a gradual, child-centered settling-in period. Typically this starts with shorter visits with a parent/caregiver present, then brief separations, building up to a full session as your child shows readiness. We share daily updates and agree on a plan together so it feels calm and predictable.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn what matters most for your child (temperament, prior childcare experience, nap needs, any languages at home).

We keep transitions calm and consistent so children know what to expect.\n\nTeacher–child ratio: we staff to maintain close supervision and responsive interaction throughout the day; exact ratios can vary slightly by age group and session, but we prioritize small-group moments and consistent key adults so children have a secure base.\n\nSettling-in/support for new children: we use a gradual transition plan tailored to each child—short initial visits, a consistent drop-off routine, and a key-person approach so one staff member is the main point of connection early on. We also communicate closely with families in the first weeks to align on comfort items, sleep/rest needs, and any separation strategies that work at home.\n\nWhat we value in families/children: we look for a good fit with our routines and communication style—families who partner with us, share information openly, and support consistency (especially around arrival/pick-up routines and attendance).
