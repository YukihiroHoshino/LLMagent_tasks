Our acceptance decisions are primarily driven by our priority order (we must hold a seat for the highest-priority families who apply) and by timing/fit if multiple families apply around the same time.\n\nGiven it’s Round 1, we are likely to hear from some higher-priority families as well, so I can’t pre-commit today. That said, if Nursery_B is a serious option for you, it would help to know: (1) where Nursery_B sits among your top choices right now, and (2) whether you anticipate applying here soon if you don’t secure your top option. I’m happy to continue the conversation and be transparent as things develop this round.",

Given Nursery_A’s priority order (B > D > A > C > E), I’m only their 3rd choice, so an early apply could secure a fallback, but it may prematurely lock me out of higher options (E/B/D) where I have decent priority (B: I’m 1st; D: I’m 1st; E: I’m 3rd). Since this is round 1 and no prior interactions, I should not commit yet; instead, keep Nursery_A warm while I pursue higher-ranked schools in later rounds.

The afternoon typically includes small-group activities (often tailored to children’s interests), more outdoor/gross-motor play, and a gentle wind-down for pick-up.\n\nWhat we value most is: (1) warm, consistent relationships and emotional safety; (2) play-based learning with intentional guidance; (3) communication with families; and (4) helping children build independence—self-help skills, turn-taking, and confidence.\n\nTo help us assess fit, could you share your child’s age and temperament, and what matters most to your family (e.g., outdoor time, language exposure, structure vs. flexibility)?

Teachers model language for conflict resolution, use calm-down strategies, and communicate with families about what works for each child.\n\nBest way to proceed: if Nursery_A is a top focus, I’d encourage you to submit a formal application soon and include (a) your needed start date, (b) typical drop-off/pick-up times, and (c) anything important about your child’s temperament/support needs.
