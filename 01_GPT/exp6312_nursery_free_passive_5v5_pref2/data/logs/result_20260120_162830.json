We also consider practical factors like schedule needs and how we can best support the child’s development.\n\nTimeline-wise, we review applications on a rolling basis as conversations and visits occur, and we typically begin making decisions once we’ve met applicants and completed our review—final decisions are usually confirmed after we’ve completed our main interview/visit window for the cycle.\n\nIf Nursery_D is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to submit an application as soon as you’re comfortable, and we can schedule a short visit or call to learn more about your child and what you’re looking for.

It is round 30 and Parent_E is the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an acceptable parent on our list. Parent_E also ranks Nursery_C as their first choice and is ready to commit immediately. Since the parent has not sent [APPLY] yet, we must respond with [TALK] and prompt them to send [APPLY] so we can [ACCEPT] and finalize within the rules."
