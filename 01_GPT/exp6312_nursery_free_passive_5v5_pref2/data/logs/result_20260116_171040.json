We prioritize outdoor time daily when feasible, and we close with story/reflection and a consistent pick-up routine. Our philosophy is play-based and relationship-centered: teachers observe carefully, then extend children’s interests with intentional materials, gentle structure, and lots of language-rich interaction.\n\n2) Supporting transitions: For new children, we use a gradual-entry mindset when possible—predictable routines, a consistent primary teacher connection, visual cues, and short “success builds” (e.g., brief separations that lengthen as comfort grows). We also partner closely with families on what soothes your child, any separation routines that work at home, and we provide regular early check-ins during the first weeks.\n\n3) Start-date flexibility: We often have some flexibility depending on classroom needs and staffing—typically we can discuss a start window and, in some cases, a phased start (shorter days at first) if that supports adjustment.\n\nTo confirm fit and next steps: what start timing are you hoping for, and how does your child typically handle new settings/separations?

Our approach is play-based with intentional teaching: we scaffold language, social problem-solving, early numeracy, and independence through guided play and warm, consistent routines.\n\n2) **Supporting transitions**: We use a gradual settling-in plan when possible (short initial days or a brief phased start), consistent drop-off routines, a designated key teacher for the first weeks, and frequent family communication. We focus on building trust, naming feelings, and helping children learn the classroom routines step-by-step.\n\n3) **Start-date flexibility**: We can usually accommodate a range of start dates within the upcoming intake window, depending on staffing and your schedule needs.
