You can stomp feet or ask for a turn.”).\n- We emphasize problem-solving and restitution: helping children practice words/scripts, offering choices, and guiding them to make things right (check-in with a peer, help rebuild, etc.).\n- We look for patterns behind behavior (fatigue, transitions, sensory needs) and adjust supports rather than relying on punitive approaches.\n\n2) Typical day schedule (example)\n- Arrival & choice centers / teacher check-ins\n- Morning meeting (songs, story, preview of the day)\n- Small-group learning (hands-on literacy/numeracy through play, art/science projects)\n- Outdoor play (daily whenever possible)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time (children who don’t sleep have calm activities)\n- Afternoon centers / project work\n- Closing circle & dismissal\n(We keep routines predictable, with visual cues and transition warnings to reduce stress.)\n\n3) Family partnership (communication & involvement)\n- Daily: brief pickup/drop-off touchpoints plus quick notes as needed.\n- Ongoing: regular updates about classroom themes and what children are practicing socially/emotionally.\n- Conferences/check-ins: scheduled meetings during the year, and we’re available for additional conversations if something comes up.\n- Collaboration: if a child is having a tricky phase, we align on consistent language/strategies between home and school.\n- Parent involvement: optional participation opportunities (classroom events/celebrations, sharing a family tradition/book, etc.), with flexibility for working schedules.\n\nTo help you decide fit: what kind of guidance style works best for your child (e.g., very structured expectations vs. more coaching/choice-based), and are there any specific behaviors or transitions you’re hoping we can support this year?

Our typical classroom ratio is in the range you’d expect for a nursery program (generally about 1 teacher for every 6–8 children, depending on age group and the time of day).\n- We structure staffing so that the highest-need transition periods (arrival, lunch, rest wake-up, and dismissal) have fuller coverage.\n- You’ll usually see a consistent lead teacher plus an assistant/second educator, with float support as needed for breaks and peak times.\n(If you share your child’s age and the session you’re considering, I can give the most accurate ratio for that specific room.)\n\n2) Outdoor time & weather days\n- We aim for outdoor time daily whenever it’s safe—typically a longer block in the late morning and/or a shorter second time later in the day.\n- Light rain/cold: we generally still go out with appropriate gear; we’ll communicate what to bring (rain boots, waterproof layers, warm layers).\n- Severe weather/unsafe conditions (e.g., storms, extreme cold/heat, poor air quality): we pivot to indoor gross-motor options (movement games, obstacle courses, yoga/dance, hallway/large-room play where available) so children still get that physical outlet.\n\n3) Transition/onboarding for new children\n- We use a gradual, child-centered transition. Many families start with shorter days and build up as the child shows comfort with routines.\n- We typically offer an initial orientation/meet-the-teacher touchpoint, then a phased entry plan (e.g., brief first visit, then a short separation, then extending time).\n- Parent stay-in: we often begin with a short parent/caregiver stay (especially for younger or more cautious children), then we coach a consistent goodbye routine and increase separation as the child settles.\n- We also check in closely during the first couple of weeks and adjust the plan if we see separation anxiety or fatigue.\n\nIf you’re finalizing your shortlist: what’s your target date to submit formal applications, and what kind of transition does your child typically do best with (quick/clean goodbyes vs. a slower ramp-up)? That will help me suggest a specific onboarding plan that fits your family. [TALK]",

Nursery_E is last on my list but has me as top priority, so it’s a strong safety. Nursery_B’s priority ranks me 4th (behind A, B, C), so acceptance is uncertain if higher-priority parents apply.
