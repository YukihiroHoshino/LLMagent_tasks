How do you feel? What can we try next?”).\n- **Relationship-based care**: key-person style attention so each child has a trusted adult who tracks their comfort, friendships, and growth.\n- **Positive guidance**: clear expectations, lots of reinforcement for helpful behavior, and calm boundary-setting when needed.\n\nIf you share a bit about what matters most for your child (temperament, any separation worries, language needs, friendships), I can explain how we’d support them specifically.

Outdoor play includes a mix of free play and simple teacher-supported activities (movement games, nature exploration, sand/water play when available).\n- **Rest/nap** is a consistent, calm routine after lunch. Children have individual rest spaces; we keep the environment dim/quiet with soothing music or stories. For children who don’t sleep, we support “quiet rest” with books or calm table activities after an initial rest period.\n\n**Supporting children who are new or need help with transitions:**\n- We use **predictable routines** and **visual/verbal cues** (e.g., warnings before transitions, consistent sequence of events).\n- We focus on **relationship-based settling-in**: a key educator helps the child build trust, and we can discuss a gradual start when possible.\n- We use **emotion coaching** (naming feelings, offering simple choices) and practical supports (comfort items if appropriate, transition objects, short jobs like “line leader” to ease moves between activities).\n\n**Family–school communication:**\n- We value **clear, two-way communication**. Typically this includes brief **daily handovers** at drop-off/pick-up, plus **regular updates** (weekly highlights and classroom notes). We also schedule **conferences/check-ins** as needed—especially during the settling-in period.\n\nA couple of quick questions so I can advise you accurately on fit and next steps:\n1) What **start date** are you hoping for, and what schedule (full-time/part-time, typical drop-off/pick-up times)?\n2) Where does Nursery_D sit among your top choices—are you considering applying here soon, or waiting on another nursery’s decision?\n\nIf you’d like, I can also share how we handle allergies/food, toileting support, and how we communicate learning and development milestones.",
