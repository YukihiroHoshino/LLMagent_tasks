Here’s a snapshot of our daily routine and approach:\n\n• Daily rhythm: We follow a consistent, predictable schedule (arrival/free play → morning circle → learning centers/small groups → outdoor time → lunch → nap/rest → afternoon activities → pickup), with flexibility for individual needs.\n• Outdoor time: We aim for outdoor play every day (weather permitting), typically a longer block in the late morning and a shorter opportunity later when possible. We focus on gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n• Nap/rest: After lunch we have a calm wind-down (stories/quiet music) and a set rest period. Children who don’t sleep can do quiet activities so everyone’s needs are respected.\n• Social/emotional development: We emphasize warm, responsive caregiving and coaching children through feelings and peer conflicts (naming emotions, turn-taking, gentle problem-solving). We use consistent classroom expectations and lots of positive reinforcement.\n• Communication with families: We share regular updates on routines, meals/rest, and social milestones, and we welcome ongoing parent-teacher check-ins.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any nap needs, and what you value most in a nursery setting).
