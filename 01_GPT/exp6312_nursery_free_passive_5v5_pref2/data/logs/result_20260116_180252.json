Happy to clarify.\n\n**Availability for this intake:** We *may* have an opening for this intake, but it depends on final confirmations over the next short period. If you’re considering us seriously, the best way to stay in contention is to schedule a brief visit/chat and submit an application so we can hold your details while we finalize places.\n\n**Decision timeline:** We aim to confirm offers on a rolling basis, typically within **1–2 weeks** after a visit/application (sometimes sooner if a place is clearly available). If you tell me your ideal start date and days/hours needed, I can give a more precise sense of timing.\n\n**Typical daily schedule:**\n- Arrival & settling-in activities\n- Morning circle (songs/stories, social-emotional check-in)\n- Play-based learning blocks (choice time + small-group guided activities)\n- Outdoor play (daily, weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon projects (art/sensory/early literacy & numeracy through games)\n- Pick-up with brief handover/notes\n\n**Class size:** Typically **10–14 children** (age-dependent), with a consistent lead educator plus support staff.\n\n**Start-date flexibility:** We can often accommodate a **rolling start** if there’s a space, and we also support a **gradual settling-in** period.\n\nIf you share (1) your child’s age, (2) your preferred start window, and (3) your schedule needs, I’ll tell you what’s most realistic for this intake and the next steps to move forward.",

We’d be happy to offer you our open place.\n\n**(1) Daily routine & outdoor/play-based time**: Our day is structured around predictable rhythms with lots of child-led, play-based learning. A typical day includes arrival/settling-in, a morning circle (songs, stories, gentle group routines), extended learning-through-play blocks (centers, sensory, art, building, pretend play), lunch, rest/quiet time, and an afternoon play block.\n\nOutdoor time is a core part of our day—we aim for **at least one substantial outdoor session daily**, and often two (morning and afternoon) when weather permits. Outdoors is a mix of free play, nature exploration, and simple movement games.\n\n**(2) Supporting transitions in the first weeks**: We use a gradual, child-centered transition plan. Typically this includes short initial days that lengthen as comfort grows, a consistent key educator who helps your child build trust, clear goodbye routines, and frequent check-ins with you. We also partner closely with families on comfort items, sleep/rest needs, and strategies for separation anxiety, and we share updates early on so you know how your child is settling.\n\nIf you’d like, I can propose a transition schedule and confirm the start date you’re aiming for. Please reply with your child’s age, preferred start date, and any key needs (allergies, nap routine, separation concerns).",

If you let us know what other decision deadlines you’re facing, we can often align a 24–48 hour response window after an offer, depending on where we are in the cycle.\n\nWhat would help you be considered strongly for our one spot:\n- Submitting an application as soon as you feel ready (that is the clearest signal of serious intent).\n- A quick note covering: your desired start date, your child’s age, schedule needs (days/hours), and 1–2 priorities for your child’s nursery experience.\n- Any relevant considerations we should plan for (e.g., separation anxiety supports, allergies/health needs, language environment).\n\nIf you’d like, share your target start date and the other schools you’re weighing (just the timing, not details), and I can tell you what decision window we can realistically offer from our side.",
