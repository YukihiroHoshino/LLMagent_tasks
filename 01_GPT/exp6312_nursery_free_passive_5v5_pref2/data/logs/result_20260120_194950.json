We’re very excited about the possibility of joining your community and can be flexible on start date and scheduling. Please let me know the next steps (forms, interview/visit timing, and any documents you’d like us to provide) and we’ll respond immediately.",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is my 2nd choice after Nursery_E, and it remains available in round 3. Given the market, Nursery_E is highly demanded (A,B,D all rank it first), so my chance there is uncertain. Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_B), which gives me a strong acceptance likelihood if I apply now. To secure a high-ranked outcome and avoid losing Nursery_A to another parent later, I should apply immediately and signal strong fit/commitment."
