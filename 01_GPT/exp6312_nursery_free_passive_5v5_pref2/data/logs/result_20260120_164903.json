I want to make this as straightforward as possible: our family is ready to accept your place immediately and finalize today if you’re able to offer it now. We can complete all paperwork right away, and we’re flexible on start date and schedule.\n\nIf you still need one specific item to confirm (e.g., exact availability window, references, or a brief family statement), please tell me exactly what it is and I will send it back immediately. Otherwise, are you able to confirm a final decision this round (offer the place or let us know you’re moving forward with someone else)?",
              "thought": "It is round 30 and Nursery_B is the only unmatched nursery. Nursery_B is on my true preference list (ranked 4th), so I should compromise to secure a match rather than risk remaining unmatched. I already formally applied to Nursery_B earlier, so I should not send another [APPLY]. Instead, I should send a final, clear commitment message and request an immediate accept/reject decision this round."

              "thought": "Parent_E is on Nursery_B’s true priority list (4th of 5) and is the only unmatched parent in the final round with quota 1 remaining. No higher-priority parents are available, so matching with Parent_E is strictly better than leaving the seat empty. Parent_E continues to send [TALK] rather than [APPLY], so I cannot finalize with [ACCEPT] yet; I should give a crystal-clear instruction to send [APPLY] and include the minimum required details, and commit to immediate acceptance upon receipt."
