Given no prior interactions and the market just starting, I should not commit yet; I can gather information while keeping flexibility to pursue Nursery_E or Nursery_A first. Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me last, so an early apply is likely to be rejected if higher-priority parents apply.

We prioritize (1) fit with our program and routines (child’s needs/temperament and family expectations), (2) schedule compatibility and start date, and (3) practical logistics like commute and consistency of attendance. If applicable, sibling/alumni connections can also be considered.\n\nFor next steps, we typically suggest: a short visit/tour (15–30 minutes) followed by a brief parent chat to confirm schedule needs and what you’re looking for. If you decide Nursery_B is a strong option, you’re welcome to apply after the visit.\n\nTo help us advise you: what start date and weekly schedule are you aiming for, and where are you commuting from? Also, are you currently leaning toward any other nursery as your first choice?",
