I’m happy to share more.\n\n**Typical daily routine (play-based, predictable structure):**\n- **Arrival & settling-in:** warm handoff, choice play, teacher check-ins\n- **Morning meeting:** songs, calendar/weather, setting intentions and classroom norms\n- **Learning through play blocks:** open-ended centers (blocks, art, sensory, dramatic play), with teachers scaffolding language, early literacy/numeracy concepts, and peer interaction\n- **Snack/lunch routines:** emphasis on independence (handwashing, serving/clean-up as appropriate)\n- **Outdoor time:** daily outdoor play whenever weather allows (gross motor, nature exploration)\n- **Story/music & small-group moments:** rotating activities to support attention, turn-taking, and communication\n- **Rest/quiet time:** developmentally appropriate rest period\n- **Afternoon play + pick-up:** recap of the day and smooth transitions\n\n**Approach to play-based learning:**\nWe use play as the primary vehicle for learning—teachers observe, join play to extend thinking, introduce vocabulary, and support problem-solving. We balance child-led exploration with gentle structure so children feel secure and know what comes next.\n\n**Social-emotional support:**\n- consistent routines and clear, kind boundaries\n- coaching language for feelings and conflict resolution (“I statements,” turn-taking, repair)\n- close collaboration with families on transitions, separation, and behavioral supports when needed\n\n**Key policies (high level):**\n- **Hours:** standard school-day schedule (we can share the exact times and any extended options based on your needs)\n- **Meals:** families typically send a packed lunch; we provide guidance on allergies and nutrition (details depend on classroom)\n- **Outdoor time:** planned daily; we ask families to send weather-appropriate clothing\n\nOn whether there may be a place this year: we do have limited capacity, and fit/timing matters. The best next step is to understand your needs and your timeline.\n\nA few quick questions so I can guide you accurately:\n1) What is your child’s age and intended start date?\n2) What hours/coverage do you need?\n3) Any allergies, separation concerns, or supports we should be aware of?\n4) Where does Nursery_A sit relative to your other options right now?\n\nIf Nursery_A is truly one of your top choices, I’d encourage you to stay closely in touch and consider submitting an application once you feel comfortable with the fit.
