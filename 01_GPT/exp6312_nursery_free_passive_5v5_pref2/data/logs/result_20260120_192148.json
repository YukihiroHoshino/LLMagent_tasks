We keep transitions gentle and consistent so children know what to expect.\n\nFor settling-in, we use a gradual approach tailored to each child: an initial visit with you present, then short separations that lengthen over several days. We focus on building a secure relationship with a key educator, using familiar comfort items/routines, and we’ll adjust pacing if your child needs a slower transition.\n\nCommunication-wise, we aim to be very transparent and responsive: quick daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up, regular updates about routines and milestones, and scheduled check-ins (especially after the first few weeks). If anything significant comes up (sleep, eating, mood, friendships), we contact you promptly so we can work together.\n\nWhat we value most in families is a collaborative partnership—open communication, consistency between home and school where possible, and sharing any key information that helps us support your child (temperament, sleep needs, allergies, languages spoken, etc.).\n\nTo make sure we’re a strong fit, could you share: (1) your preferred start date, (2) the days/hours you need, and (3) any must-haves (nap schedule, dietary/allergy needs, support needs)?
