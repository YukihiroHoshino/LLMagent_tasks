We use gentle scaffolding (modeling, open-ended questions, and guided choices) rather than worksheets.\n\nSupporting new children (transition): We do a gradual start when possible (shorter initial days), assign a consistent key teacher, and keep routines very steady in the first weeks. We work with you on comfort items, separation strategies, and daily check-ins. We also share brief updates so you know how your child is settling.\n\nIf you tell me a bit about your child’s age and temperament (e.g., cautious vs. adventurous, nap needs, any allergies), I can explain how we’d tailor the transition.
