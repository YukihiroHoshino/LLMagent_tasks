We’ll also contact you if a child is struggling beyond what’s typical, and we’ll adjust the plan together.\n- **Observation + individualized plan:** We watch for triggers (drop-off, transitions, nap, group time) and tailor strategies (choice-making, quiet corner, movement breaks).\n\n2) **Communication with parents**\n- **Daily handover:** Quick check-in at drop-off and pick-up (mood, sleep, meals, highlights).\n- **Regular updates:** We share short updates on how the day went—especially during the settling-in period—so you’re not left wondering.\n- **Photos/activities:** We share photos and brief notes of activities (frequency depends on the day’s flow, but we aim to keep parents meaningfully in the loop).\n- **Progress check-ins:** A more structured check-in after the initial settling period (typically within the first few weeks) to discuss how your child is adjusting and any goals.\n- **Conferences:** Scheduled meetings as needed, and you can always request one if something comes up.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s **age**, **start date**, and your ideal **drop-off/pick-up window**, I can suggest a transition plan that fits your family.
