Families who submit an application are reviewed on a rolling basis, and we aim to confirm offers promptly once we’ve spoken and received materials.\n\nIf it helps, I can answer a few quick questions so you can decide whether to apply: what start date are you aiming for, your child’s age, and whether you need full-time vs. part-time days?",
