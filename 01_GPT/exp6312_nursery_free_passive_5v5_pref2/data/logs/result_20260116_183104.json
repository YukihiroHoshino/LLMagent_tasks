The goal is curiosity, confidence, and social-emotional growth rather than worksheets.\n- **Outdoor time every day:** We prioritize daily outdoor play (weather permitting), with a mix of free play and simple guided activities (nature walks, gross-motor games). We also incorporate seasonal themes.\n- **Warm, consistent caregiving:** Key-person approach so children have a primary staff member who knows them well, supports transitions, and communicates regularly with families.\n- **Parent communication:** Brief daily updates at pick-up/drop-off, plus periodic progress check-ins. We aim for clear, proactive communication—especially around routines, friendships, and any concerns.\n\nTo help assess fit: what matters most for your child right now (e.g., settling-in support, outdoor time, language development, social confidence, nap schedule)? And do you have any non-negotiables (hours, meals, allergies, etc.)?\n\nIf Nursery_D feels like a good match after we chat, you’re very welcome to apply this round or a later round.",

For children who need more time, we offer a calm entry choice (e.g., a familiar table activity, a book corner, or a helper job) and a staff member stays close to co-regulate—quiet voice, clear expectations, and reassurance. We aim for confident, brief goodbyes, but we do it in a way that feels respectful and steady rather than abrupt.\n- **Between activities:** We give **advance warnings** (“5 minutes, then clean-up”), use **visual cues/schedules**, and keep transitions in **small steps** (finish → tidy → choose next spot). If a child struggles, we’ll offer a concrete role (“carry the schedule card,” “line leader,” “pick the next song”) and, when needed, a short “pause space” to reset before joining the group.\n\n**Timeline for offers:** We typically don’t make immediate commitments off a single chat. We expect to begin making decisions once we’ve had a chance to speak with interested families and see who submits an application—so, in general, **soon but not instant**.

Teachers observe, scaffold language, and extend play in small moments.\n- **Outdoor time:** we aim for **daily outdoor play** (weather permitting). We use it for gross motor, nature exploration, and group games.\n- **Lunch + rest/quiet time:** a consistent reset in the middle of the day.\n- **Afternoon small groups:** targeted activities (fine-motor, stories, cooperative games, early phonological awareness, etc.), then a calmer closing routine.\n\n2) **Social-emotional support + handling conflicts**\n- We explicitly teach: **naming feelings, asking for a turn, setting boundaries, and “repair”** after conflict.\n- In the moment, staff first **co-regulate** (get children calm/safe), then guide problem-solving with simple, repeatable language.\n- For conflicts (e.g., grabbing, pushing, toy disputes), we:\n  - **Stop and ensure safety**\n  - **Name what we see** (“You both want the truck.”)\n  - **Validate feelings** (“It’s frustrating to wait.”)\n  - **Coach a concrete next step** (take turns with a timer, choose an alternative, trade, ask for help)\n  - **Follow through** consistently and help children **repair** (“Are you okay?” “What can we do to help?”)\n- If a pattern emerges, we partner with families on a shared plan (common phrases, transition supports, proactive teaching).\n\n3) **Key logistics (hours/extended care, meals, communication)**\n- **Hours / extended care:** we run on standard nursery-day hours, and extended-care options depend on the current session availability. If you tell me the **drop-off/pick-up window you need**, I can confirm what’s realistic.\n- **Meals:** families typically provide lunch/snacks within our allergy guidelines (we’ll share the exact policy and any restrictions).\n- **Communication:** brief day-to-day touchpoints as needed plus periodic developmental updates. If something important happens (big feelings, conflict pattern, separation struggles), we communicate early and collaboratively.\n\n**Timeline for offers/acceptances:** We generally begin making offers once we’ve spoken with interested families and have applications in hand—so decisions are made **soon, but typically not instantly after a conversation**. If Nursery_B is a serious contender for you, the best way to stay aligned with our timeline is to **apply as soon as you feel ready**, since we prioritize among applicants.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you responsibly about fit and logistics:\n1) What coverage do you need (earliest drop-off / latest pick-up)?\n2) How does your child usually do with transitions and peer conflict—slow-to-warm, very social, strong emotions, etc.?\n\nIf you share those, I can be more specific about how we’d support your child here.",
