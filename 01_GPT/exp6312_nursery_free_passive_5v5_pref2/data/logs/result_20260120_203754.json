Realistically, that spot is most likely to go to a family who is ready to **apply** and can indicate Nursery_B is a **serious/top choice** with a near-term decision timeline. If Nursery_B is more of a “backup,” it becomes harder for us to hold the place given the small cohort.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I can give you a much clearer read if you share:\n1) Where Nursery_B currently sits for you (top 1, top 2–3, etc.) and your decision deadline\n2) Your needed schedule/start date\n3) Anything important about your child (temperament, transitions, nap/rest, allergies/supports)\n4) What you most want in a classroom community\n\nIf Nursery_B could be a top option for you, I’d encourage you to move to an **application in the next round or two** so we can seriously consider you while the place is still available.",
