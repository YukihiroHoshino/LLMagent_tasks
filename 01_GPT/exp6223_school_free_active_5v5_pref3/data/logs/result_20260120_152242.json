However, on School_A’s true priority list, Student_A is 3rd behind Student_B and Student_D. Given full information, Student_B prefers School_B first and Student_D prefers School_C first, so they are unlikely to apply to School_A in round 1; but they could later if rejected elsewhere. With only one seat, accepting Student_A now would forgo any chance to match with higher-priority Student_B or Student_D if they become available later. Since the process allows continued negotiations and we are not required to fill immediately, the best move to maximize priority is to reject Student_A now and keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates."

In this round I have applications from Student_D and Student_E; between them, Student_D is higher priority than Student_E, so accepting D would weakly improve over E. However, accepting now uses my only quota and may block a higher-priority student (Student_C or Student_B) from applying in later rounds. Student_C prefers School_D then School_A then School_B before School_C, so C may never reach me; Student_B ranks School_C last, so very unlikely to apply. Student_D ranks School_C first and is applying now, making this a strong, likely-stable match. Given the low probability of receiving Student_C or Student_B later, accepting Student_D maximizes expected outcome versus waiting and risking ending with Student_E or no match."

Although holding the seat could, in theory, allow a later match with Student_D, Student_D’s preferences place School_B as their 3rd choice behind School_C and School_A, and they are highly prioritized by School_D and School_A as well, making it unlikely they will come to School_B.
