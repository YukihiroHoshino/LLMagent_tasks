However, accepting Student_D now would fill my only seat and could block a higher-priority student (Student_C or Student_B) from matching with me later. Looking at student preferences: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (after D, A, B), so they are unlikely to apply to me early and may never apply if they secure a higher choice. Student_B ranks School_C last, so they are extremely unlikely to apply. Student_A ranks School_C 2nd and might apply if rejected by School_A; Student_D and Student_E both rank School_C 1st. Given this, the realistic higher-priority threat is low: Student_C is unlikely to reach me, Student_B almost certainly won't. Therefore, taking Student_D (my #3) now is prudent and better than risking ending up with Student_E (#4) or Student_A (#5) later, or remaining unfilled if timing goes poorly."
