Between them, Student_D is ranked higher than Student_E, so if choosing only among current applicants, accepting Student_D is better. However, I must consider whether I can likely obtain a higher-priority student (Student_C or Student_B) by waiting. Student_C ranks School_C 4th (behind D, A, B), so they are unlikely to apply to me early and may never reach me if admitted elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_C last, so extremely unlikely to apply. Therefore, holding out for C or B is not promising. Student_D ranks School_C 1st and is committing, making this a stable, high-quality match (3rd on my list). With quota 1, accepting Student_D now is optimal versus risking ending with Student_E or no match."

However, accepting Student_B now would fill the only seat and foreclose the chance to match with Student_D if they later apply.

Since we prefer leaving the seat unfilled to taking someone outside the list (not relevant here) but still want the highest possible within the list, we should continue to hold out rather than accept Student_E now.

However, we cannot see other schools’ current matches; still, by round 7, if A/C/B are unmatched, they might eventually come. To maximize our outcome, we should continue to wait some rounds but also give Student_E a clear trigger/round to apply so we can fill if no higher-priority appears.
