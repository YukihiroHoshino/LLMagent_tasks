Since we can only respond ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, and holding is not allowed, the safest way to maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority student is to reject Student_B now and keep the seat open for potential Student_D/Student_A. Risk: Student_B is very likely to go elsewhere (School_B is their 1st), so we may end up unmatched, but objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and Student_B is not the top tier for us."

Accepting Student_B now fills my only seat and prevents taking Student_E later, but waiting is risky because I might end up unmatched.

Between these two, Student_A is ranked higher than Student_E on my priority list, so if I must choose now, accepting A is better for my objective than accepting E. However, Student_B (my top choice) and Student_D (second) have not applied to me yet; looking at their preferences, Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (behind B and D) and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (behind C), so they might apply later if rejected elsewhere. Still, there is no guarantee they will reach me within remaining rounds, and I can only respond once per round per student; rejecting A again risks ending up with a lower-priority match or even unfilled if top candidates never apply. Since A is my 3rd choice and is strongly committed to enroll, I should secure a high-priority match now rather than gamble. Therefore, accept Student_A and fill the seat."
