In round 3, only Student_E is in the inbox, but accepting now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with Student_C/Student_B if they apply later. Student_C currently ranks School_C 4th and may not apply soon, but could if rejected elsewhere; Student_B ranks School_C last so unlikely; Student_D/E rank School_C first and have applied. Since we prefer a higher-priority student and have no indication that Student_C is matched yet, optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Student_E to preserve the seat for a potential higher-priority applicant. Student_E is on our acceptable list, but not high enough to justify filling immediately given remaining rounds."
