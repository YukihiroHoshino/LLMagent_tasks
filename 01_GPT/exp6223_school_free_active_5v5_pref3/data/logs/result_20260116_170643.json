Although I would prefer Student_C or Student_B, neither has contacted me this round, and accepting Student_D now secures a relatively high-priority match within my quota (1).

With quota 1, accepting A now would block the chance to match with higher-priority B or D. Since round 1 is early and only A has applied, it is strategically better to reject now and wait for potential higher-priority applicants, accepting the risk that B/D may match elsewhere.

Student_D (#1) has not applied to me and ranks School_B third, so they may end up at School_C or School_A first; waiting risks losing a strong match if Student_A goes elsewhere.
