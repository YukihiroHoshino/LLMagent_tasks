Looking at student preferences: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), Student_B ranks School_C 5th (very unlikely to apply). Student_D ranks School_C 1st and has applied with commitment, making them a strong, likely-stable match. With quota 1, accepting Student_D now secures a relatively high-priority student; waiting risks ending up with Student_E or Student_A if Student_D matches elsewhere, and Student_B is unlikely to come.
