Between them, Student_D is ranked higher than Student_E, so accepting D is better than accepting E if I must choose now. However, my top two (Student_C and Student_B) have not contacted me yet; Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply early, but could still come later if rejected elsewhere. With only one seat, accepting Student_D now locks in a 3rd-choice outcome for me but guarantees a solid match with a student who has School_C as first choice. Rejecting D to wait is risky because I might end up with Student_E (ranked lower) or possibly no one if others never apply. Given D’s strong commitment and higher priority than E, I should accept Student_D now to secure a relatively high-ranked match within my list."

Given full information: Student_B’s top choice is School_B (School_B ranks Student_B 3rd), and Student_D’s top choice is School_C (School_C ranks Student_D 3rd). Both may or may not end up applying to School_A later, but it is early (round 1) and there is meaningful upside in waiting for a higher-priority applicant. Since we must respond to an [APPLY] with [ACCEPT] or [REJECT] (no tentative holds), the optimal move to maximize expected chance of matching higher on the priority list is to reject Student_A now and keep the seat open."

However, Student_D (#1) and Student_E (#2) may apply later; given their own preferences, Student_D ranks School_D last (unlikely to apply), while Student_E ranks School_D 4th (possible but not likely early).
