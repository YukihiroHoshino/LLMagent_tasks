If offered admission, I will accept immediately and withdraw from all other options.\n\nI understand you must follow your priority list and keep the seat available for higher-priority candidates if they are still in play. If none of those candidates are actively applying for your seat this round (or if it has become clear they are unlikely to seek School_C), I would be very grateful to be considered now so the open place can be finalized.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains unmatched and it is my top true preference. Although they have repeatedly rejected me to preserve the seat for higher-priority students (C, B, D), we are in a later round and the seat is still open. The best move is to apply again with a clear immediate-accept commitment and a respectful note that I understand their priority policy, while asking them to consider filling the seat this round if no higher-priority candidates are actively applying."

If you still intend to enroll at School_C immediately upon an offer (as you stated), we are pleased to welcome you.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "As School_C, my true priority list is C > B > D > E > A, and I have quota 1. Student_E is ranked 4th, but higher-ranked candidates (Student_C and Student_B in particular) may still seek other schools first; however, by round 15, prolonged waiting risks ending unmatched. Student_D already applied earlier and was rejected, and Student_C ranks School_C 4th while Student_B ranks School_C last, making it increasingly unlikely they will apply to us. Given the late round and no other applicants in the inbox, accepting Student_E now secures a match that is still within my acceptable list, avoiding the risk of remaining unfilled."
