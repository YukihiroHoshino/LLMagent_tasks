However, Student_C (my top choice) and Student_B (2nd) have not contacted me yet; given their preferences, they may approach other schools first but could come later. With a quota of 1, accepting D now would lock in and prevent matching with C or B if they apply in later rounds. Since I am allowed to reject and wait, and D can likely match elsewhere (D ranks School_C first but is also highly prioritized by School_D and School_B), the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to reject D now and preserve capacity for Student_C or Student_B."
