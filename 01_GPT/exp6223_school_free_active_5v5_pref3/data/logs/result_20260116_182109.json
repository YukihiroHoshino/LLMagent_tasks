We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but accepting Student_E now would foreclose the possibility of matching with higher-priority students (Student_A, Student_C, Student_B) if they later become available. Student_E continues to [TALK] rather than [APPLY], and no new information indicates higher-priority candidates are definitively out of play. Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list, we should maintain the hold and provide a consistent status update."

Since School_E is the only school still unmatched, I want to plan responsibly and avoid submitting another formal application if the hold will still require an automatic rejection.\n\nCould you please confirm whether the hold is still fully in place this round, or whether there has been any meaningful change (e.g., any higher-priority candidates are now firmly matched elsewhere or no longer in play for School_E)? If there is any specific signal you are waiting for before you can release the hold, I’d be grateful to know.\n\nIf at any point you are able to consider candidates beyond the hold, please let me know immediately and I will submit a formal [APPLY] right away in that same round, and I will accept an offer from School_E immediately.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",

However, by round 15 School_E is the only unmatched school; Student_E has repeatedly applied and been rejected, indicating no higher-priority student is approaching us. Given students' preferences, Student_A ranks School_E last, Student_B ranks it 4th, Student_C ranks it last, Student_D ranks it 4th, Student_E ranks it last—so it is unlikely higher-priority candidates will ever apply. Continuing to hold risks ending unmatched, which is worse than filling with an acceptable candidate on our list. Student_E is on our list and willing to accept immediately; though they have not applied this round (only TALK), we should keep door open and invite an APPLY this round, committing to accept upon receipt."
