If we reject to wait for Student_D or Student_A, we risk ending unmatched because Student_D prefers School_C/School_A/School_B (School_B is only #3) and Student_A prefers School_A/School_C/School_D over School_B (#4). Given quota=1 and no other applicants in this round, accepting Student_B is a safe strategy that still yields a relatively high-priority student."

However, because our quota is 1, accepting now would foreclose the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_D or Student_E if they apply later. Looking at students’ preferences: Student_D ranks School_D last, so it is unlikely they will apply unless rejected elsewhere; Student_E ranks School_D 4th, also relatively unlikely to apply early. Student_B ranks School_D 2nd and could apply; Student_A ranks School_D 3rd. Given the low likelihood of receiving an application from Student_D or Student_E within the limited rounds and the strong commitment signal from Student_C, accepting Student_C now maximizes expected outcome while still aligning with our priority list (Student_C is included)."
