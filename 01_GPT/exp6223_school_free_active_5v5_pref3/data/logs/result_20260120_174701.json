With quota 1, accepting now could block higher-priority Student_D or Student_A, who may still apply later. However, Student_B lists School_B as #1, so this is a reliable match. Check whether higher-priority students are likely to come: Student_D prefers School_C then School_A then School_B (3rd), so may not apply immediately; Student_A ranks School_B 4th; Student_C ranks School_B 3rd; Student_E ranks School_B 2nd. Given School_B is top choice for Student_B and there is no mechanism for tentative holds, the safest way to secure a decent match is to accept Student_B now rather than risk ending unmatched if top candidates never apply."

Those three students all have School_C relatively high (A: 2nd, B: 5th, C: 4th, D: 1st, E: 1st). So if I apply to School_C now, I’m likely to be rejected if higher-priority students apply. My best strategic move is to secure a high-preference school where I have strong priority. At School_D, I am ranked 2nd (behind Student_D). Student_D’s top choice is School_C, so there’s a good chance Student_D applies to School_C first, leaving School_D available for me. Therefore, I will apply to School_D in round 1 to lock in a strong match rather than risk losing out elsewhere."
