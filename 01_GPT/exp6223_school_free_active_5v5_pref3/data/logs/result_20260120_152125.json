Given full information: Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (after School_B, School_D) and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (after School_C). So Student_D is a realistic higher-priority candidate who may apply to School_A if rejected by School_C, and Student_B could also come later if not admitted to School_B/School_D. With quota 1, accepting Student_A now risks missing Student_D (higher priority and plausibly attainable). Therefore reject Student_A to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates."

If we accept B immediately, we forgo the chance to match with Student_D or Student_A, who are higher priority and may plausibly be available: Student_D prefers School_C then A then B, so D might not end at B, but could if rejected by C/A. Student_A ranks B 4th, so less likely to come. Given we can only respond ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, and holding is not allowed, the strategic choice is to reject now to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates, accepting the risk of ending unmatched. Since B is still on our list, but not top, we prioritize the option value of waiting for D/A."

With quota 1, accepting Student_E now secures my second-choice overall and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if Student_D never applies.
