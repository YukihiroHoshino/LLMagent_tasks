Student_B ranks us 1st, making this a reliable commitment and reducing uncertainty.

Check students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (behind B, D) so may apply later if rejected elsewhere; Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (behind C) so may also apply if not matched with C. Since there is still a reasonable chance to attract higher-priority B or D in subsequent rounds, optimal strategy is to reject E now to preserve capacity.

Despite two prior rejections, with capacity still open there is a chance priorities shifted if higher-ranked students matched elsewhere. I will re-apply with a concise, commitment-forward message, emphasizing immediate acceptance and fit, without being repetitive or pushy."

After reviewing our current priorities and the limited availability for this cycle, we’re not able to extend an offer to you this round.\n\nWe appreciate the time and effort you’ve put into your application and wish you the very best with your remaining choices.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_A Admissions",

However, Student_A is not our top targets, and accepting now could block a later application from Student_B or Student_D, who are ranked above A and may still be unmatched and could approach us later (they each have other higher-ranked preferences, but the market is still early at round 4). Student_A has applied repeatedly and is committed, but we have already rejected them multiple times, signaling we are holding out for higher-priority candidates. With quota available, the optimal strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue rejecting Student_A while waiting for B or D."
