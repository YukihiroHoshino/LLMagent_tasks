Student_D does not rank School_D highly (last), but could still apply if rejected elsewhere; Student_E ranks School_D fourth, also possible later.

Waiting to try for Student_B or Student_D is risky because Student_B’s 1st choice is School_B and Student_D’s 1st choice is School_C; both may match elsewhere quickly due to strong priorities at those schools.
