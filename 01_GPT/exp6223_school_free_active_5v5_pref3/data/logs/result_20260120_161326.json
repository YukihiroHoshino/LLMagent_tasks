School_C is my 2nd choice but already rejected me based on priority, and School_C ranks me last, so another APPLY is very unlikely to succeed. School_E is my 5th choice but it ranks me 1st in priority, so an APPLY there should be accepted if they still have capacity. To secure the best achievable match given the remaining options, I will apply to School_E and signal commitment."
