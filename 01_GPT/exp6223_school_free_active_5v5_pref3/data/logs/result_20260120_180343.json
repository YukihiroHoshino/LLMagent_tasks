With quota 1, accepting Student_D now would lock in and prevent matching with higher-priority Student_C or Student_B if they become available in subsequent rounds.

With one seat, applying to School_C now is likely to be rejected and wastes a round. My 2nd choice is School_B; although I am last in School_B’s priority, Student_B is likely to focus on School_B (their #1), and Student_D/Student_A may also compete there, so it’s still tough. My best strategic shot is School_D (my 4th): School_D ranks me 2nd, and Student_D (ranked 1st) may apply to School_C (their #1) or School_A, so I have a realistic chance to secure an early acceptance at School_D.

Student_E is ranked higher than Student_C on our list, so accepting E now secures our second-best possible outcome unless Student_D later applies. However, if we accept E, we cannot later take D. We should consider whether Student_D is likely to apply to School_D: Student_D’s preferences rank School_D last, so it is very unlikely they will apply unless rejected everywhere else, which may not happen within 30 rounds. Therefore, the rational move to maximize expected outcome is to accept Student_E now rather than risk losing them while waiting for an unlikely Student_D application. Also, Student_E states readiness to commit, reducing risk of reneging (not modeled, but consistent with commitment)."

Since accepting Student_A now would fill the only seat and prevent matching with the top-choice Student_C—who is actively applying and states they will accept immediately—it is optimal to reject Student_A and preserve capacity for Student_C. Student_A has already been rejected twice, and nothing in the current message changes their priority position relative to other available candidates."
