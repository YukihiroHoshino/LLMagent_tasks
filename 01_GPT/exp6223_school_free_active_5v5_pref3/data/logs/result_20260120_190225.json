Student_C is my 3rd choice, and they are applying with School_D as their first choice, meaning they would likely commit immediately and reduce uncertainty. However, Student_D (my top choice) prefers School_C first and School_A second, and ranks School_D last, so it is unlikely they will apply to me early (or at all unless rejected elsewhere). Student_E ranks School_D 4th, also unlikely to apply early. With only one seat, accepting Student_C now secures a relatively high-priority match rather than risking ending up with a lower-priority student or an unfilled seat if higher-priority students never approach. Therefore, accept Student_C."

Given the objective to match as high as possible on my priority list, it is worth holding the seat for at least a bit rather than committing immediately to a 3rd-choice candidate.

There is a possibility of attracting Student_B or Student_C later, but neither contacted me this round and they rank School_C low (B has C last; C has C fourth), making them unlikely to apply soon.
