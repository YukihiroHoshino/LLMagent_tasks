In round 1, only Student_A has applied to us, but Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (likely applies to School_B first) and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (likely applies to School_C first). Since we have quota 1, accepting Student_A now would lock us in and prevent matching with higher-priority students if they later apply. Given the early round and the likelihood that higher-priority students may become available, it is strategically better to reject now and keep capacity open."

Although School_B’s priority list ranks me 3rd (behind Student_D and Student_A), applying immediately gives me the best chance to secure the seat before higher-priority students commit elsewhere.

Given the market, Student_D is the top priority for multiple schools (notably School_D and School_A), and Student_A’s top choice is School_A; neither is likely to apply to us immediately. Student_E may apply to us as their 2nd choice but is our last priority. With quota 1, accepting Student_B now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked student or remaining unmatched if higher-ranked students never approach us."

Accepting Student_D now secures a higher-priority match and uses my single quota. Although Student_C (my top choice) and Student_B (2nd) might appear in later rounds, they both rank School_C low (4th and 5th respectively) and are likely to apply elsewhere first, making it risky to wait. Student_D lists School_C as first choice, so acceptance is likely stable and optimal given current information."

Student_C is my 3rd choice, and they have applied with School_D as their first choice, making acceptance likely to secure a match immediately. However, higher-priority students Student_D and Student_E may approach later: Student_D ranks School_D last, so is very unlikely to apply here; Student_E ranks School_D 4th, also unlikely unless rejected elsewhere. Given the round is 1 and my quota is 1, holding out risks ending unmatched, while accepting Student_C yields a solid (top-3) outcome with high stability because Student_C prefers me most.

However, Student_B (rank 1) prefers School_B first and School_D second; Student_D (rank 2) prefers School_C first; Student_C prefers School_D first. Given other schools’ priorities, Student_B is highly desired by School_B and may be matched there; Student_D is top for School_B and School_D and may be taken quickly; Student_C is top for School_C and may go there or to School_D. Waiting risks ending unmatched. With only one seat and a credible commitment from Student_E, accepting now secures a filled seat with an acceptable student rather than gambling on higher-ranked students who are unlikely to come to School_A soon."
