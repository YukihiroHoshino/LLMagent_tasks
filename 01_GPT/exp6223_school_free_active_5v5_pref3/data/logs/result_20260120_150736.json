Given this is only round 1 and we have full information: Student_D ranks School_B #3 and may apply after attempting School_C then School_A; Student_A ranks School_B #4 and is less likely early. To maximize chance of a higher-priority student within quota 1, reject Student_B now, expecting Student_D to become available later.

Yet we have full information: each of A, B, C, E ranks School_E last, so it is very unlikely they will ever apply unless all other schools reject them. Given it is round 25/30 and D is the only active contact, the risk-adjusted strategy is to move to fill the seat soon, but still preserve one more round or two for any surprise. Since D is only [TALK] this round, we cannot accept; we should answer: no new applies; and now, given checkpoint end, instruct D to submit [APPLY] next round for immediate consideration (without absolute guarantee, but practically yes)."
