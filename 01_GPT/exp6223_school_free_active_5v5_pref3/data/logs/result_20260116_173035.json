However, Student_E is only talking (not applying), and higher-priority students (Student_C, Student_B) have not contacted me yet; they may apply elsewhere first given their preferences (Student_C ranks School_C 4th; Student_B ranks School_C 5th), so the probability they apply to me soon is low. Rejecting Student_D risks ending up with Student_E or no match. Accepting Student_D secures a solid match aligned with my priority list.

Accepting Student_B immediately secures our top-choice match and ends our participation. Student_E is lower priority and has already been rejected before; holding out offers no upside because Student_B is already applying now and could match elsewhere if we delay. Therefore accept Student_B."

While I’ve explored other options, I’m genuinely excited about the possibility of joining School_D because I’m looking for a rigorous environment with clear expectations where I can contribute consistently.\n\nI’m dependable and follow through on commitments, work well in teams, and try to strengthen my community by supporting classmates and taking responsibility in group/club settings. Academically, I’m motivated by challenging coursework and steady improvement.\n\nIf admitted, I’m ready to commit and would be eager to contribute positively to School_D’s community. Thank you for considering my application.",

I will submit a concise, sincere application emphasizing reliability and fit, and signal that I’m ready to commit if accepted."

Student_D (my top choice) has not applied to me and ranks School_D last, so it is unlikely they will apply later unless rejected everywhere else; waiting carries a significant risk of ending unmatched. Student_E is my second-highest priority and is actively applying now with stated willingness to commit. I previously rejected other lower-priority applicants (C, B, A). Given the current round (4) and no better candidate in the inbox, accepting Student_E secures a high-priority match and avoids the downside risk of holding the seat for Student_D who is unlikely to come."
