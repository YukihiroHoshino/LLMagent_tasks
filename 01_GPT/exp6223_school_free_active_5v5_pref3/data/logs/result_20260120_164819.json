If I accept Student_C, I fill my only seat and forgo the higher-priority Student_E. If I reject Student_C, I preserve capacity to potentially accept Student_E (or even Student_D if they later apply, though Student_D ranks School_D last). Given the objective to match with the highest possible student on my true priority list within quota 1, I should reject Student_C to keep the seat available for Student_E (and possibly Student_D)."

My second choice is School_B, where I am ranked last, so that is also unlikely. School_D is my 4th choice, but I am ranked 2nd there (behind only Student_D), making it a strong and realistic target to secure a match early.

Student_D (my top choice) has School_D as last choice, so is very unlikely to apply to me unless rejected everywhere else; waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked student later.

Accepting Student_D now secures a relatively high-priority match and uses our only seat, but waiting risks ending up with a lower-priority student or no match.
