Given the full market info: Student_D prefers C then A then B; School_C’s top is Student_C, and School_A’s top is Student_B. Student_D is top priority at School_D and also high at School_A and School_B, so D may end up elsewhere, but we should not lock in #3 immediately in round 1. Student_A ranks us 4th, so less likely, but could be displaced from A/C/D and come to us later. Rejecting now preserves flexibility to pursue D/A in later rounds; accepting now would end the search.

However, Student_C (my top choice) has School_C as 4th choice and is likely to apply elsewhere first (School_D, then School_A, then School_B). Student_B ranks School_C last, and Student_A ranks School_C 2nd but I rank Student_A last. Student_D ranks School_C 1st and is also top priority for School_D and high for other schools, so if I reject now I may lose them and end up with a worse match or unfilled seat.

I have already been rejected by School_A and School_D, and given each school has capacity 1 and schools follow their priority lists, my best chance to secure any acceptable match now is to apply to a school where I have relatively strong priority. At School_B, the priority order is Student_D, Student_A, Student_B, Student_C, Student_E—so I am 2nd, which gives me a solid chance if Student_D goes elsewhere. Therefore I will submit a formal application to School_B and signal commitment."

On School_B’s priority list: Student_A is ranked #2, Student_C is ranked #4. Student_D (#1) is not in the inbox and may be harder to secure because Student_D prefers School_C then School_A then School_B, and those schools may accept them. Student_B (#3) already applied and was rejected earlier. Student_E (#5) also rejected. Given Student_A is applying now and is a top available option, accepting Student_A maximizes School_B’s outcome relative to waiting for an uncertain chance at Student_D."
