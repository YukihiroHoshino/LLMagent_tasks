Student_D’s top choice is School_C, so they may not apply to School_D in round 1, giving me a good shot to secure School_D immediately.

              "message": "Student_C, thank you for your continued interest in School_A and for your clear commitment to enroll if admitted. Given our remaining capacity and the current stage of the process, we are able to extend you an offer of admission. Congratulations—we look forward to welcoming you to School_A. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "School_A has quota 1 and true priority list ranks Student_C last. Higher-priority students (B, D, A, E) exist, and accepting C would lock in a low-priority match. However, it is round 29 with no other applicants in the inbox and no indication higher-priority students will apply to School_A in the final round; many likely matched elsewhere given their preferences. Waiting risks ending unmatched, but School_A prefers being unfilled over taking someone not on the list; Student_C is on the list, so acceptable as a last resort. With only two rounds left and persistent demonstrated commitment, accept to avoid remaining empty."
