Although Student_B is applying now and ranks us #1 (so would likely commit), Student_D (#1) and Student_A (#2) both rank School_B as their #3 and #4 respectively, so they may apply later depending on outcomes at their higher choices. Given I can only accept one and an acceptance finalizes the match, accepting Student_B immediately risks losing the chance to match with higher-priority Student_D or Student_A.

However, my quota is 1 and accepting Student_D immediately could block a higher-priority student (Student_C or Student_B) from applying in later rounds. Looking at student preferences: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (likely to apply later only if rejected elsewhere), and Student_B ranks School_C last (very unlikely to apply). Student_A ranks School_C 2nd (could apply if not matched to School_A), but Student_A is below Student_D on my list. Student_D ranks School_C 1st and is committing if admitted, making this a strong, stable match. Given the low likelihood of receiving Student_B and the uncertain/late possibility of Student_C, accepting Student_D now maximizes expected outcome versus waiting and risking ending unmatched or with a lower priority candidate."
