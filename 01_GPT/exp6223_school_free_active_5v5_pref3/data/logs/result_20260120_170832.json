So you should not assume an offer from us is likely *this round*.\n\nIf it helps your decision-making: if you want to keep a path open with School_A, you can continue to check in, but I would also strongly encourage you to actively pursue other schools you prefer/that may admit you sooner rather than waiting on us.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_A Admissions",

Strategically, I should continue to signal that E is only considered if no higher-priority applicants (B, D, A) apply by the late rounds. Given students' preferences, B ranks School_A 3rd, D ranks it 2nd, and A ranks it 1st (but I already rejected A earlier, though they could reapply). It remains plausible that higher-priority students may come later if rejected elsewhere. Therefore I should respond candidly: E could be accepted only if the seat remains open and no higher-priority applicants apply by a defined later round; otherwise E should pursue other options."

Student_B ranks School_A 3rd and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd, so both could still apply if they are rejected elsewhere.
