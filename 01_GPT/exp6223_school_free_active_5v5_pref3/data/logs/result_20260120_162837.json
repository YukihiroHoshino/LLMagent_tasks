Accepting Student_E now secures a high-priority match; the only better outcome would be Student_D, but they did not contact us and rank School_D last, making it very unlikely they will apply. Therefore, accepting Student_E is optimal versus holding out and risking losing both E and C."

From student preferences: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), and Student_B ranks School_C last (very unlikely to apply). Student_D ranks School_C 1st and has already applied, making an immediate, reliable match likely. Given the low probability of receiving an application from Student_B and the delayed/uncertain chance from Student_C, accepting Student_D now maximizes expected outcome under capacity 1 and avoids ending unmatched."
