Given the market information, Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are less likely to apply early, but it is still possible if they are rejected elsewhere. Student_D ranks School_C 1st, so rejecting risks losing a solid, high-commitment candidate; however, since my objective is to match as high as possible on my true priority list, I should keep the seat open for at least the early rounds rather than immediately accept my 3rd choice.

Student_D ranks School_B 3rd (after C, A) and Student_A ranks School_B 4th, so they may not apply early or at all. Given only one message in round 1, the safest way to maximize priority would be to wait for D/A, but the mechanism does not allow holding—only accept or reject.
