Waiting risks losing Student_C to another school only if we reject; Student_D and Student_E are unlikely to apply to School_D early because Student_D ranks School_D last and Student_E ranks School_D 4th. Given quota 1 and low likelihood of higher-priority applicants coming, accepting Student_C now maximizes expected outcome."

In round 1, only Student_D and Student_E applied. Accepting Student_D now guarantees a relatively high-ranked match and fills my only quota. However, Student_C and Student_B both rank School_C low (4th and 5th respectively), so it is unlikely they will apply to me later unless rejected elsewhere; waiting risks ending with a lower-ranked applicant or no match. Since Student_D has School_C as first choice and is applying with commitment, accepting is a strong, low-risk outcome compared to holding out for unlikely higher-priority applicants."
