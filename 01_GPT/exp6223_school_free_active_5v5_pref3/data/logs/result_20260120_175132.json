So higher-priority candidates are less likely to apply to me early, especially Student_D and Student_A. If I reject Student_B now, I risk ending up unmatched or matched with a lower-priority student later.

Student_B ranks School_C last, so unlikely to apply. Student_E ranks School_C first and may apply soon; Student_E is below Student_D on my priority list.

Check likelihood: Student_B’s top choice is School_B (School_B ranks Student_B 3rd) and Student_D’s top choice is School_C (School_C ranks Student_D 3rd). Both could be accepted elsewhere, so waiting risks ending with only lower-ranked options or an unfilled seat. However, Student_A is our 3rd choice and is highly committed (School_A is their 1st).

School_A is my 3rd choice and I am 4th there, but importantly Student_B (School_A’s top) prefers School_B first, Student_D prefers School_C first, and Student_A prefers School_A first—so there is a plausible path where School_A is not flooded by multiple higher-priority applicants in round 1, giving me a non-zero chance.
