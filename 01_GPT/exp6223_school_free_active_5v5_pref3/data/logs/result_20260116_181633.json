However, I should consider whether waiting could yield Student_C or Student_B. Student_C ranks School_C 4th and is likely to apply first to School_D, then School_A, then School_B; they may never reach me. Student_B ranks School_C last, so is very unlikely to apply.

              "thought": "As School_E, my true priority list ranks Student_E 4th (A, C, B, E, D). I have quota 1 and remain unmatched, so I should only accept Student_E if I believe higher-priority students (A/C/B) are unlikely to apply and accept later. Given the market info: Student_A ranks School_E last; Student_C ranks School_E last; Student_B ranks School_E 4th; Student_D ranks School_E 4th. So only Student_B is a plausible higher-priority candidate who might still come to me, but they prefer B, D, A ahead of E and may get placed there. Student_E has repeatedly applied and credibly commits to enroll immediately, reducing risk of ending unmatched. With no other applicants in the inbox this round and uncertainty about future higher-priority applicants, accepting Student_E now secures the seat rather than holding out for a low-probability better match."
