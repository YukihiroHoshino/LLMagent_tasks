Student_E ranks School_D fourth and is also unlikely to come unless rejected by School_C/B/A; School_D ranks Student_E second, but School_C ranks Student_E fourth and School_B ranks Student_E last, so Student_E might end up at School_A or School_C before coming to me.

School_B remains my top available choice, and if offered admission I will accept immediately and enroll.\n\nSince we are now in round 7 and School_B is the last unmatched school, could you let me know whether you are still expecting any higher-priority candidates to apply this round? If not, I would be grateful for your reconsideration for the open seat.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",

Given it is round 7 and the market is nearly cleared, the best move is to submit another formal application emphasizing immediate commitment and asking for a clear status update on whether any higher-priority candidates are still realistically in play this round."

              "thought": "Student_E is last on School_B’s true priority list. However, by round 7 School_B is the only unmatched school and has no evidence that higher-priority students (D/A/B/C) will apply: Student_B already applied and was rejected; Student_D and Student_A rank School_B third/fourth and likely matched elsewhere; Student_C ranks School_B third and likely pursued higher choices. With no other messages in the inbox and continued rejection risking an unfilled seat through round 30, accepting Student_E now maximizes expected outcome versus leaving the seat empty."
