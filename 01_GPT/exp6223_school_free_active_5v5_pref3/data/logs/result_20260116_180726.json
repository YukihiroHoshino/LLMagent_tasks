Still, accepting Student_D now would fill my only seat and prevent upgrading if a higher-priority student unexpectedly applies soon. Given the mechanism described does not allow holding/waitlisting and later switching, the safest way to maximize my chance of matching with a higher-priority student is to reject now and keep capacity open.

With quota 1 and no applications from higher-priority Student_C or Student_B yet, I should avoid committing to a lower-priority student too early if there is a reasonable chance Student_C or Student_B will apply to School_C later. Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply to me early; however, they may get rejected elsewhere and eventually come. Student_E ranks School_C 1st, so accepting would lock in a match but at a lower priority than potential future candidates. Given the objective to match as high as possible on my priority list, and since I can still wait (no requirement to fill immediately), I will reject Student_E this round to preserve the seat for the possibility—however small—of receiving Student_C or Student_B later.
