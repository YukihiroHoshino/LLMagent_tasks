Check likelihood: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (after D, A, B), so unlikely to apply early; Student_B ranks School_C last, very unlikely; Student_E ranks School_C 1st and may apply soon; Student_A ranks School_C 2nd and may apply if rejected by School_A. Therefore, holding out could yield Student_E (ranked above D) with decent probability. Since I can reject now and keep capacity, and D likely has other options (they rank C 1st but can go to A/B/E next), optimal is to reject to preserve chance for higher-ranked candidates, especially Student_E."

There is still a meaningful chance Student_D (or even Student_B after rejection elsewhere) could apply in later rounds.

However, Student_D is my top priority and may apply later; yet Student_D’s preferences place School_D last, so it is unlikely they will apply unless rejected everywhere else.
