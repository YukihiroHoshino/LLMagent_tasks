Student_D (my top choice) has not applied to me; given Student_D’s preferences (School_C first, School_A second, School_B third, School_E fourth, School_D last), it is unlikely they will come to me unless rejected elsewhere, so waiting is risky.

Student_A already applied in round 1 and was rejected, so unlikely to return with higher value than holding out for Student_B.
