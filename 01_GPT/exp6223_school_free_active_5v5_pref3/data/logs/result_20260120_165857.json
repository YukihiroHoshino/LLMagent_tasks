Since we cannot hold offers and must either accept or reject, the optimal strategy to maximize expected match quality is to reject Student_A now and keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates."

If we accept D now, we forgo the chance to match with higher-priority C or B, and possibly E (ranked above A but below D).

Given no other applicants in the inbox this round and the risk that higher-priority students may never apply to School_B (they may pursue their own top choices), accepting Student_B secures a solid, high-priority (top-3) match rather than gambling on uncertain future applications."
