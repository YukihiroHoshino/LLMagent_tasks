However, Student_C (my top choice) and Student_B (second) have not contacted me yet; given their preferences, Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply early (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Student_D ranks School_C 1st, making this a strong, reliable match.

Student_E ranks School_E last, indicating low mutual fit and higher risk they would prefer others if available, but under rules an [ACCEPT] with their [APPLY] forms a binding match. However, since School_E remains unmatched through round 6, it is plausible higher-priority students (A/C/B) may apply later after being rejected elsewhere; accepting Student_E now would forgo the chance to match with A/C/B. Given we prefer leaving unfilled over taking someone not on list (not applicable here) but still aim to match as high as possible, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Student_E and wait for higher-priority candidates."
