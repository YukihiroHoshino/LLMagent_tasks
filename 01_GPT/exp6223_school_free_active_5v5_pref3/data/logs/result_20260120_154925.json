Given full information: Student_B’s top choice is School_B and Student_D’s top choice is School_C, so they may not approach us immediately, but both list School_A relatively high (Student_B ranks us 3rd; Student_D ranks us 2nd). It is plausible that either could apply in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Since we prefer a higher-priority match and there is no penalty stated for waiting other than risking ending unmatched, the optimal move to maximize our match quality is to reject Student_A now and keep the seat available for Student_B or Student_D."

Student_E ranks School_D 4th, so also unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_D 2nd and could apply later if School_B doesn’t work out, but School_B’s top priorities are Student_D then Student_A, so Student_B may be displaced and come to me; however that is uncertain. Given my quota is 1 and an immediate, committed application from my #3 is available, accepting now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for higher-ranked but unlikely applicants."

There is also a possibility that higher-priority students (Student_C or Student_B) may apply later, but rejecting Student_E does not reduce my ability to accept Student_D this round/next.

In round 16, only Student_E applied to us; however, accepting now would forgo the chance to match with higher-priority students if they later approach School_A. Given Student_B ranks School_A 3rd, Student_D ranks School_A 2nd, and Student_A ranks School_A 1st (and has already applied once), there remains a meaningful possibility that a higher-priority student could apply in later rounds due to rejections elsewhere. With 14 rounds remaining, it is still rational to hold the seat to maximize outcome on our true priority list. Therefore, reject Student_E again while encouraging them to pursue other schools."

However, by Round 17 with no contact from B/D/A to School_A across many rounds, the probability they will apply here seems low; additionally, Student_A already applied earlier and was rejected, suggesting they may have moved on.
