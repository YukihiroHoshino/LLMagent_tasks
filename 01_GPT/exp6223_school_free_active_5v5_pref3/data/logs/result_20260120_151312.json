However, Student_D ranks School_C as their #1 choice and has already applied in round 1, making acceptance likely to secure a match immediately. Waiting for Student_C or Student_B is risky because neither ranks School_C first (Student_C ranks School_C 4th; Student_B ranks School_C 5th), so they are unlikely to apply early and may match elsewhere. With quota 1 and no other applicants this round, accepting Student_D is a strong, low-risk outcome compared to holding out for higher-priority students who may never apply."

To maximize my chance of getting as high as possible on my true list, I should target a school where I have a strong priority position. At School_D, I am ranked 2nd (behind Student_D), and School_D is still reasonably high on my list (4th). An early [APPLY] to School_D gives me a good chance to secure a match if Student_D goes elsewhere, and even if School_D prefers Student_D, I can potentially be held as the top remaining option. Therefore I will apply to School_D immediately."

Student_C has applied this round and School_D is Student_C’s first choice, making them a credible immediate match. Student_E ranks School_D 4th, so they may prefer other schools (C, B, A) and could leave later, but in this protocol an [ACCEPT] finalizes the match. Holding out for Student_D is risky because Student_D’s last choice is School_D, so they are unlikely to apply. Given we must respond now and want the highest feasible priority within quota, accepting Student_E would block a likely stable match with Student_C and still might not beat the possibility of Student_C being secured now. Therefore reject Student_E to preserve quota for Student_C (and the slim chance of Student_D)."

With quota 1, accepting Student_A now would block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_B or Student_D if they become available in later rounds.

Given full information: Student_D ranks School_B 3rd (after School_C, School_A) and Student_A ranks School_B 4th, so they may not apply immediately, but they are plausible later if rejected elsewhere. Meanwhile, Student_B ranks School_B 1st and is applying now, so rejecting risks ending up unmatched if higher-priority students never come. However, because Student_B is still relatively high on our list and is a guaranteed, stable match, and because we only get one shot per [APPLY] message (must accept or reject), the safer strategy to secure a strong match is to accept Student_B now rather than gamble on uncertain later applications from D/A."
