I noticed many peers were getting stuck not because they “weren’t capable,” but because they lacked a clear step-by-step approach and confidence to ask questions. I responded by creating simple, repeatable explanations and short practice sets, and by running regular help sessions.\n\n[Concrete outcome]\nThis led to more consistent participation in help sessions and improved follow-through among the students I supported (more students returning week-to-week and coming prepared with specific questions rather than giving up). I also became more effective at adapting explanations to different learning styles—something I now apply in group work by making sure everyone can engage with the material.\n\n[Why School_C]\nSchool_C’s peer-learning and student leadership culture matches how I learn and contribute: by clarifying ideas for others, raising the floor for the whole group, and taking responsibility for steady, practical improvement. If admitted, I would like to continue tutoring in a more structured way and help build study supports that make it easier for students to seek help early.\n\nSchool_C is one of my top choices, and if accepted I will commit with enthusiasm.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_A",

Given School_C’s priority list places me last, I need to maximize fit and clarity to improve my chances, but applying now is still optimal because it is the highest available option and delay risks losing the last seat."
