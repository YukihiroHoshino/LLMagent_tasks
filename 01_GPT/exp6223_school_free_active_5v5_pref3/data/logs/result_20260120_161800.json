Student_D ranks us 2nd and is top priority at School_B and School_D, so D likely matches elsewhere but could still apply to us if not. Student_A ranks us 1st but we rejected earlier to hold for B/D; A may reapply if unmatched. Therefore, it's still rational to keep the seat open for B/D/A rather than commit to E now.
