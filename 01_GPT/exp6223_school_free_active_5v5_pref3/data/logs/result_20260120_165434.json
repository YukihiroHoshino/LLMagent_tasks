Those three students also have School_C relatively high (C: 4th, B: 5th, D: 1st), so School_C is likely to be highly contested and I may be rejected if I apply immediately. My 2nd choice is School_B, where I am ranked last, so that’s also unlikely. My 3rd choice is School_A, where I am ranked 4th; however, Student_B (ranked 1st) has School_A as 3rd, and Student_D (ranked 2nd) has School_A as 2nd, so it may still be competitive. My best realistic option is School_D (4th on my list) where I am ranked 2nd, and only Student_D is above me; Student_D’s top choice is School_C, so there is a good chance School_D will accept me if I apply now. Securing a solid match early is better than risking rejection at my top schools and ending up at School_E. I will apply to School_D with a clear, committed message."

Student_A ranks School_B 4th, so unlikely to apply early. Given the round-1 uncertainty and that Student_B is within our acceptable list and strongly committed, accepting now secures a solid outcome with low risk of ending unmatched; waiting risks losing Student_B to another school (they have School_D as 2nd, School_A as 3rd) and we may end up with lower priority students later.
