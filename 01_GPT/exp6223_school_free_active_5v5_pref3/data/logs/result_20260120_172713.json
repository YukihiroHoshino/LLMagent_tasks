Given quota=1 and round 1, it is strategically better to hold the seat for a higher-priority student if possible. Student_D ranks us last, so unlikely to apply; Student_E ranks us 4th, still possible later if rejected elsewhere. However, accepting Student_C now would lock in a mid-ranked outcome and prevent upgrading. Therefore reject now to preserve the possibility of matching with Student_E (or Student_D if unlikely) in later rounds; if no higher-priority candidate emerges later, we risk ending unmatched, but the objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list."

Given the round-based process and that B/D have not contacted me yet and may be pursuing their higher choices first, accepting E now would secure a match but risks missing B or D later. However, the mechanism appears binding once accepted, so I should only accept if I believe B/D are unlikely to apply soon. Looking at student preferences: B ranks School_A 3rd (behind B and D), D ranks School_A 2nd (behind C). Both could plausibly apply later if rejected elsewhere. Since it's only round 2, it's prudent to keep the seat open and reject E to preserve the chance for B or D, who are substantially higher on my priority list."
