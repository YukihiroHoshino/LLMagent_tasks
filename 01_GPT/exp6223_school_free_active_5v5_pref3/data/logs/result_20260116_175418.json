While Student_A reaffirms interest, they indicate School_C is their second choice, and I already rejected them previously. Given I want the highest-ranked student possible and Student_E is available and interested, I should keep the seat for higher-priority candidates rather than accept Student_A now. Therefore, reject Student_A this round."

Although E was previously rejected while holding out for higher-priority candidates (C/B/D), none of C or B have approached, and D already applied earlier and was rejected. Given the need to fill the single quota with the highest-ranked available applicant, accepting E now dominates rejecting again (which risks ending up with only lower-ranked A or an unfilled seat if top candidates never apply).
