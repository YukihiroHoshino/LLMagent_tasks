Rejecting to wait risks ending unmatched or matching with a lower-priority student (Student_B/#4 or Student_A/#5).

However, Student_C (my top choice) and Student_B (second) have not contacted me yet; Student_C currently ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply early, but could later if rejected elsewhere. If I accept D now, I fill my only quota and lose any chance at C or B. Still, D lists School_C as 1st choice, meaning high commitment and low risk of losing them, and D is also highly sought by other schools (top at School_B and School_D), so rejecting risks missing out entirely. Given the mechanism (acceptance creates an immediate match), but my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list, I should preserve the option to potentially get Student_C or Student_B by rejecting D now and waiting. Since D is only my 3rd choice and there is time (round 1 of 30), I will reject D to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates."
