However, accepting Student_D immediately would use my only quota and could prevent matching with higher-priority Student_C or Student_B if they apply in later rounds. Given that Student_D lists School_C as first choice, they are likely to accept and remain committed, but I can still reject now and potentially lose them to other schools later. Student_D’s top choice is School_C, yet School_A and School_B rank Student_D highly, so if I reject, Student_D could quickly match elsewhere. Still, maximizing my outcome means holding out for Student_C or Student_B if possible; with only one round elapsed, it is rational to reject and wait for higher-priority candidates."

Student_B ranks School_D 2nd and could apply, but Student_B’s first choice is School_B, so they will likely apply there first.
