Still, I cannot hold offers; an [ACCEPT] creates a binding match and removes me from the market. Given the rules, the safest way to keep the seat available for a higher-priority student is to reject now, but that risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students never come. With only one seat and a solid applicant who has School_C as first choice, accepting Student_D secures a relatively high-ranked match (3rd) and avoids the risk of being left with only lower-ranked options later.

However, higher-priority students (A/C/B) may still become available later if they are rejected by their preferred schools; given their preference lists, School_E is generally low for them, but could become a late option. Accepting Student_E now would fill our only seat and eliminate any chance to match with A/C/B if they approach later. Since we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over locking in a lower-priority match too early, and we are not at the final round, it is optimal to reject for now despite Student_E’s strong commitment."

Student_E has repeatedly applied with strong commitment; however, no higher-priority candidates have approached me yet. Given the market structure (students initiate contact), I can afford to wait a bit longer because accepting E now would permanently forgo the chance to match with A/C/B if they later apply. Student_E is asking for a decision point and conditional/expiring offer; I can provide a clear timeline without committing. I should keep them warm via [TALK], indicate a specific review round (e.g., end of round 9/10), and invite them to apply again then; if still unmatched and no higher-priority applicants have appeared, I can reconsider. I should not make a binding conditional offer within the rules; instead, I can state an intention to re-evaluate and potentially issue an offer at that time with a short acceptance window."
