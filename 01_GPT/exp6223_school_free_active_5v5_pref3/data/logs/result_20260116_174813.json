Student_D (my #1) has not contacted me and, based on Student_D preferences, ranks School_D last, so is unlikely to apply. Student_C (#3) already applied and was rejected earlier; Student_A (#5) is applying again but is lower priority than E. With quota 1, accepting Student_E now secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of remaining unmatched while waiting for an unlikely Student_D application."
