Clear fit with our program and a well-explained motivation for School_C also helps.\n\nIf School_C is truly your top choice, the best way to demonstrate that is to submit a formal application. If you do, please also share 1–2 specific academic interests you want to pursue here and one concrete way you’d contribute to our community.\n\nHappy to answer any questions you have about the program or what to highlight in your materials.",
