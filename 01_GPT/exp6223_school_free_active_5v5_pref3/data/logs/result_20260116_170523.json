In a student-proposing environment, it is plausible Student_D will first apply to School_C/School_A and could be rejected due to competition, then come to School_B. Therefore, to maximize the chance of a higher-priority match within quota 1, we should reject Student_B now rather than commit early."

Meanwhile, higher-priority Student_D ranks School_D last and is unlikely to apply; Student_E ranks School_D #4 and may not apply early.

Student_C ranks School_C 4th and is likely to apply first to School_D/School_A/School_B; Student_B ranks School_C last and is very unlikely to apply. Student_D ranks School_C 1st and is offering immediate commitment, making this a strong and reliable match.
