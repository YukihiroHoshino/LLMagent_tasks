If offered admission, I will accept and enroll. Thank you for your consideration. [APPLY]",

Student_B (#3) and Student_E (#5) already applied earlier and were rejected to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates. In the current round, only Student_A is in the inbox, and we have 1 seat unfilled. Accepting Student_A secures a very high-priority match now and avoids the risk of remaining unmatched while waiting for Student_D, who may be pursued/accepted by higher-ranked options (School_D is Student_D’s last choice, but School_C is their first and School_A is second; competition is plausible). Given the quota of 1 and the strong commitment signal from Student_A, accepting is optimal."
