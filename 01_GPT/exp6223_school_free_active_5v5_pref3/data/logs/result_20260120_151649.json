Given Student_D ranks School_B 3rd and Student_A ranks School_B 4th, they may still apply later if rejected elsewhere, but they also have strong alternatives and may match before reaching us. With only one seat and no other current applicants, accepting Student_B secures a mutually strong fit (Student_B lists School_B as #1) and avoids the risk of ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked student later."

Student_B ranks School_D 2nd and could apply, but is ranked below Student_C on our list. Given the low probability of receiving an application from Student_D or Student_E and the risk of ending unmatched if we reject, the best strategy to maximize expected outcome within quota is to accept Student_C now."

Given the environment, Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (likely to apply to School_B or School_D first) and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (but will likely apply to School_C first). There is a meaningful risk that waiting for Student_B/Student_D could leave us unmatched if they are accepted elsewhere. Since Student_A is still relatively high on our list and explicitly states School_A is first choice/strong commitment, accepting is a safe strategy to achieve a high-priority match rather than gamble for a slightly higher-ranked student who may never apply or may be taken by other schools."

Student_D is my 3rd choice and is applying now with School_C as first choice, meaning accepting would lock in a decent match. However, with quota 1, I should consider whether higher-priority students (Student_C or Student_B) might apply soon. Student_C ranks School_C 4th and is likely to apply to School_D then School_A then School_B first; School_D prioritizes Student_D highest and may accept them, pushing Student_C elsewhere, but Student_C could still end up applying to School_C later if rejected by top choices. Student_B ranks School_C last, so unlikely to apply. Student_E is lower priority than D and only talking. Given Student_D’s strong commitment and the risk that Student_D matches with School_D (where D is top priority) if I delay, accepting now secures a relatively high-priority, stable match. The upside of waiting for Student_C seems low due to their preferences and competition, so accept Student_D."

Also, School_E is last choice for all students, so higher-priority students are unlikely to apply early, but they may if rejected elsewhere. Given we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone not on the list (and Student_E is on the list), the key tradeoff is timing: reject now to keep flexibility and attempt to attract higher-priority candidates in later rounds."
