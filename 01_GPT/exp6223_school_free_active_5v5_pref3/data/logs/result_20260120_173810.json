Student_E ranks School_E last, so they are likely applying only after failing elsewhere; however they credibly state they will enroll if accepted. Higher-priority students (A, C, B) all rank School_E last as well, making it unlikely they will apply soon unless they exhaust other options. Waiting could in theory yield a higher-priority applicant, but after 8 rounds none have contacted us, and repeated applications from Student_E indicate immediate fill is possible now. To maximize chance of filling within the round limit while still selecting someone on our priority list, accepting Student_E is reasonable versus continued vacancy risk."
