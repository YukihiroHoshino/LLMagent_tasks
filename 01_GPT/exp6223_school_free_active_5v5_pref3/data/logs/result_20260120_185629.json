If I reject Student_B now, I risk ending up with a lower-priority student (Student_C or Student_E) or even an unfilled seat if higher-priority students match elsewhere. With quota 1 and no other applicants this round, locking in Student_B is a safe way to ensure a reasonably high-priority match rather than gambling for Student_D/Student_A who may never apply."

At round 17, no higher-priority student has applied to me this round, but accepting E now would permanently forgo the chance to match with B/D/A if they approach me in subsequent rounds. Since my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list (and I prefer leaving unfilled over deviating from the list, though E is on it), the optimal strategy remains to hold the seat for B/D/A until it becomes clear they are matched elsewhere or the process nears the end.

Keeping the seat unfilled until round 30 risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting E (who is on our list).
