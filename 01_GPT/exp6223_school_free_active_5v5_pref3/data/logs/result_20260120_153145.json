The key question is whether holding out could yield Student_B or Student_D (our top two). Student_B’s preferences place School_A 3rd (after School_B and School_D), and Student_D places School_A 2nd (after School_C). It is plausible they may approach us later if rejected elsewhere, but there is no guarantee, and we risk ending unmatched by repeatedly rejecting a willing candidate.

With quota 1 still open and no current match, it is strategically better to keep the seat available in case a higher-priority student (especially Student_B or Student_D) applies later. Student_E has repeatedly applied; the binding constraint is priority order, not missing materials. Since Student_E contacted with [TALK], respond with [TALK], be transparent that admission depends on whether higher-priority candidates claim the seat, and encourage Student_E to pursue other options while we keep the file active."
