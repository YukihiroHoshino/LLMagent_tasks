However, in a student-proposing environment, Student_C (my top choice) prefers School_D first and may not apply to me unless rejected elsewhere; Student_B ranks School_C last and is unlikely to apply. Given uncertainty about receiving higher-ranked applicants and the benefit of securing a committed student now within quota 1, accepting Student_D is a strong move rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-priority student later."
