Between them, Student_D is ranked higher than Student_E, so accepting Student_D weakly dominates accepting Student_E. However, Student_C and Student_B are higher-priority and may apply later; if I accept Student_D now, I lose the chance to match with them. Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply to School_C early (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Given uncertainty and the mechanism allowing only one message per round, it is safer to accept the best available higher-ranked applicant now rather than risk ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked student. Therefore accept Student_D."
