However, Student_C and Student_B are ranked higher than Student_D and may apply later. If I accept Student_D now, I forgo the chance to match with Student_C or Student_B. Given Student_D lists School_C as first choice, a rejection risks losing a solid acceptable candidate; but the mechanism does not allow a 'waitlist'—I must accept or reject. Considering Student_C’s preferences put School_C as 4th and Student_B’s preferences put School_C as 5th, it is unlikely they will apply to School_C early or at all unless rejected elsewhere.
