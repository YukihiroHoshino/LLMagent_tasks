Waiting for Student_A (#1) is risky because Student_A ranks us last and likely will not apply; other schools also rank Student_A relatively well. Student_C ranks us last too, but they are actively applying now and committing, so accepting secures a high-priority match immediately rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked student later. No conflicting applicants in inbox, so accept."
