Given the market info: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (likely to try D/A/B first), Student_B ranks School_C last (unlikely but still possible if rejected elsewhere), and Student_D ranks School_C 1st (already applied and was rejected earlier, but could reapply). Since there is no round limit pressure yet (round 12 of 30) and I prefer a higher-ranked student, the optimal strategy is to continue holding the seat and reject Student_E again, despite their strong commitment, because commitment cannot override priority in my objective. I should communicate clearly that we cannot offer at this time and encourage them to pursue other options, while noting we can reconsider only if higher-priority candidates are no longer in play in later rounds."
