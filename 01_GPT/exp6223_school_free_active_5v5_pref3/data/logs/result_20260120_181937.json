Student_B ranks me last, so also unlikely. Student_E is only talking and ranks below Student_D on my list. Given quota 1 and the low likelihood of receiving an application from Student_C or Student_B soon, accepting Student_D now maximizes expected outcome and avoids ending unmatched."

Given quota=1 and the goal to match as high as possible on our priority list, it is worth waiting at least a round or two to see if Student_D (or Student_A) becomes available; rejecting now keeps capacity open. Student_B can pursue other schools where they may also do well, and we can reconsider only if still unmatched later (though rules don’t specify re-application limits, rejection is safer than premature acceptance)."
