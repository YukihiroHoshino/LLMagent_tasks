In the current inbox, only Student_A and Student_E applied; Student_E is ranked higher than Student_A, so if choosing between these two now, Student_E is preferable. However, Student_C and Student_B (both higher priority) have not yet applied to School_C; they currently prefer other schools first, but could become available in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now would lock the seat and prevent matching with Student_C or Student_B later. Given we are only in round 4 (out of 30), it is strategically better to hold the seat open and reject Student_E for now to preserve the chance of matching with a higher-priority student. Student_E is still on our list, so we can consider them later if top candidates do not materialize."

The only applicant this round is Student_E, who ranks 4th on our list (acceptable but not ideal). However, Student_C (our top choice) prefers School_D then School_A then School_B then School_C; Student_B ranks School_C last; Student_D and Student_A have already applied to us earlier and were rejected, indicating we were holding out for higher-priority candidates. Given the market, it remains plausible that Student_C could eventually apply to School_C if rejected elsewhere, and accepting Student_E now would fill our only seat and prevent matching with any higher-priority student later. Since we prefer to wait for higher-priority candidates and have repeatedly rejected Student_E already, the consistent strategy is to reject again this round."

Student_E is on my priority list (4th), so accepting them yields a better outcome than leaving the seat empty, unless I have a realistic chance to attract Student_C/Student_B/Student_D in later rounds. Student_D already applied earlier and I rejected, likely to hold out for higher priorities, but Student_D’s first choice is School_C and may return; however, continued rejections risk ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply. Student_C’s preferences rank School_C 4th, making it unlikely they will approach me unless rejected elsewhere; Student_B ranks School_C last, very unlikely to apply. Given the low probability of receiving Student_C or Student_B soon and the cost of continued delay, accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) student rather than risking an unfilled seat by round 30."
