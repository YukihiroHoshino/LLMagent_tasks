Student_C’s preferences place School_C 4th, so they are unlikely to apply early and may match elsewhere (School_D or School_A) before reaching me. Student_B ranks School_C last, so they are very unlikely to apply at all.

Given the history, Student_E has been persistent but there is no evidence that higher-priority candidates are definitively unavailable; the best strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue holding the seat for higher-priority candidates and reject E’s application this round. Only Student_E is in the inbox, but our objective is not to fill quickly—it is to match as high as possible on our priority list; leaving the seat unfilled is preferable to locking in a lower-priority match while higher-priority candidates may still appear."
