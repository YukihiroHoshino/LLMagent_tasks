However, Student_C (my top choice) prefers School_D first, then School_A, then School_B, then School_C, so they are unlikely to apply here early and may never reach me. Student_B ranks School_C last, also unlikely. Student_A ranks School_C second but may try School_A first.

Check likelihood: Student_D’s preferences rank School_D last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere; Student_E ranks School_D 4th, also unlikely early. Student_C is therefore a relatively strong and plausible match. However, since this is round 1 and we can only respond once with accept/reject, the decision is between locking in a decent (rank-3) match now or gambling for higher-priority candidates who are unlikely to come.

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Our true priority list ranks Student_E 4th, but still acceptable. In round 25, only Student_E applied to us; no higher-priority candidates (Student_B, Student_D, Student_A) are in our inbox. Given the agreed late-window policy and the risk of remaining unmatched if we continue to wait (higher-priority students may already be pursuing or matched to schools they prefer: Student_B prefers School_B/D over us; Student_D prefers School_C over us; Student_A already applied and was rejected and may be elsewhere), accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable candidate and fulfills our stated commitment to consider them meaningfully in rounds 25–30 if no higher-priority applicant is present."
