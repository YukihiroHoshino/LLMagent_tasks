Given full information: Student_B ranks School_A 3rd (likely applies first to School_B, then School_D), and Student_D ranks School_A 2nd (likely applies first to School_C). So there is a meaningful chance that either Student_B or Student_D could come to us in subsequent rounds if rejected elsewhere.

              "thought": "As School_E, my true priority ranking is A > C > B > E > D. Student_B is my 3rd choice and is applying now with willingness to accept immediately. Given it is already round 4 and I have no current match, holding out risks ending unmatched if A or C never apply to me (both rank School_E last). B ranks School_E 4th but is actively applying, indicating realistic availability. Accepting B secures a decent outcome within quota rather than gambling for higher-ranked students who are unlikely to approach."
