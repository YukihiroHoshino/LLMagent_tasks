Given the market info: Student_D prefers School_C then School_A then School_B; Student_A ranks School_B 4th. Student_D is highly sought by multiple schools (top at School_D, high at School_A and School_B), so they may not reach us. Student_A is top at School_E and mid elsewhere; unlikely to come to us early. However, with only round 1 and no immediate pressure to fill, it's strategically better to reject now to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates.

I have been repeatedly rejected due to their seat-holding strategy, but with limited rounds left the best chance to get matched at all is to keep submitting a formal application while clearly signaling unconditional, immediate commitment and readiness to complete any required steps right away."

              "thought": "School_E’s true priority is A > C > B > E > D, so Student_E is 4th. However, by Round 25 no higher-priority student has applied to School_E, and given students’ preference lists, School_E is last choice for Students A, C, and E, and 4th for Student_B—so the likelihood of A/C/B applying this late is low. With only one seat and no competing applications in the inbox this round, continuing to hold risks ending unmatched at Round 30, which is worse than filling with an acceptable (listed) student. Student_E is on the acceptable list, has repeatedly committed to enroll immediately, and accepting now secures a match and ends uncertainty."
