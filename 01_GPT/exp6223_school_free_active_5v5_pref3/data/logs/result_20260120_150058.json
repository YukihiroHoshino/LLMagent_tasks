However, Student_D is ranked 1st at School_D and is very likely to apply there, making acceptance uncertain. In round 1, the best strategy to maximize my outcome is still to apply to my true first choice immediately rather than delay, since any hesitation could leave me without a seat at a top option. I will apply to School_D with a clear commitment message to encourage acceptance if possible."

Since quota is 1, accepting now would block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_D or Student_E. Given full information: Student_D’s last choice is School_D, so unlikely to apply early; Student_E ranks School_D 4th, so may also not apply soon. However, waiting risks losing Student_C (who has School_D as 1st choice) to another school only if they accept them—School_C ranks Student_C highest and Student_C ranks School_C 4th, so Student_C would not apply there before trying School_D. Therefore, rejecting now to hold out could be risky if no one else applies, but accepting now guarantees a solid match with a relatively high-priority student who is committed. With no other inbox candidates this round and Student_C being a strong, immediate-accept applicant, the expected value of accepting outweighs speculative waiting for higher-priority students who are unlikely to target School_D early."
