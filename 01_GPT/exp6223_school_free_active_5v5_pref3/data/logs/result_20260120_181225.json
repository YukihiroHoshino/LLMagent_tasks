However, my top two (Student_C, Student_B) have not contacted me yet, and Student_D’s preferences list School_C first, so rejecting risks losing a strong, likely-to-enroll candidate. Given the one-shot nature of an APPLY decision and quota=1, accepting Student_D secures a high-priority (3rd) match and avoids ending up with a lower-ranked student or unfilled seat if higher-ranked candidates never apply."

Student_E is only TALKing this round, so no accept/reject required; respond with [TALK] while keeping flexibility and not committing to a timeline that forces acceptance.

Student_E has repeatedly applied and credibly commits to accept immediately, but we have already rejected multiple times to preserve optionality. By round 8, continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched if the market finishes without higher-priority applicants ever approaching. Since Student_E is on our acceptable list and is ready to finalize now, accepting secures a match rather than gambling on low-probability late applications from higher-priority students."
