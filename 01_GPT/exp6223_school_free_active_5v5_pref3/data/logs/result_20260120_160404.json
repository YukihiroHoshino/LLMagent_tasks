Although no other students contacted School_E this round, accepting Student_E now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority students (Student_A/Student_C/Student_B) if they become unmatched and apply in later rounds. Given our stated preference to leave the seat unfilled rather than compromise on priority order, and since we still have remaining rounds, we continue to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates.

If the process continues and no higher-priority applicants come forward, your candidacy can become realistically competitive for the open spot.\n\nIf you would like to remain under consideration, you may continue to check back and/or submit an application in a later round.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions",

However, accepting Student_E now would end my ability to match with higher-priority students (A/C/B) if they later apply. Given Student_E has repeatedly applied and I have consistently rejected to preserve the option for higher-priority matches, the best move is to continue to wait while keeping the seat open. Since Student_E is only asking via [TALK], I should respond candidly: admission is unlikely unless higher-priority students do not apply by the end, and I cannot precommit.

It is unlikely that A or C will apply to me, and B applying is possible but not strongly likely. We are already in round 8 with no other inbound interest, and repeated rejections risk ending with an unfilled seat, which is worse than accepting an acceptable (though lower-ranked) student.
