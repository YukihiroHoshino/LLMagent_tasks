In students’ preferences, Student_D ranks School_B 3rd and Student_A ranks School_B 4th, so they may apply elsewhere first, but School_B is Student_B’s 1st choice and an immediate secure match.

My 3rd choice School_A ranks me 4th, but Student_B and Student_D are ahead and may target it. School_D ranks me 2nd, which gives me a strong chance to secure a match early against competition.

Although Student_C lists School_D as first choice, Student_E also includes School_D (4th) and is willing to commit; given the rules, accepting Student_E now secures my higher-priority available option.
