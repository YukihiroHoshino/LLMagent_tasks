Between them, Student_D is ranked higher than Student_E, so accepting D is better than accepting E. However, Student_C (my top choice) has School_C as 4th choice and will likely apply first to School_D/School_A/School_B; Student_B has School_C as last choice; Student_A has School_C as 2nd choice but I rank A last. Given quota=1, a guaranteed match with a relatively high-priority candidate (Student_D, my #3) who lists us as first choice is strong, and waiting risks ending up with a lower-ranked applicant or no acceptable improvement.

No other students contacted School_A this round, but historically higher-priority candidates (especially Student_B and Student_D) have not applied here yet and may still do so in later rounds. Accepting E now would finalize the match and foreclose the possibility of matching with B/D/A later, which is worse for School_A’s objective. Given the repeated pattern and the ability to keep the seat open, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Student_E while waiting for higher-priority candidates."

However, we are in Round 18 and School_A is the only unmatched school, suggesting other schools likely filled their seats; higher-priority students may already be matched elsewhere given their preferences. Still, accepting E now would forfeit the chance to match with B or D if they appear.

With only one unmatched school left and repeated absence of higher-priority applicants, holding the seat further risks ending unmatched (worse than accepting an in-list candidate).
