Both Student_C and Student_B do not list School_C as their first choice (they rank it 4th and 5th respectively), so they may not apply soon or at all.

Our true priority list ranks Student_D last but still included, and we prefer unfilled only over students not on the list. We deliberately set a late-stage rule: after 2 consecutive late-stage rounds (20–21) with no higher-priority APPLY, we would invite Student_D for a final APPLY and decide immediately. That condition was met and we explicitly invited. In the current round, the only message in the inbox is Student_D’s APPLY; there are no competing higher-priority applicants to consider. Accepting secures a match rather than risking ending unfilled in later rounds, and is consistent with our stated process and credibility. Therefore, accept Student_D."
