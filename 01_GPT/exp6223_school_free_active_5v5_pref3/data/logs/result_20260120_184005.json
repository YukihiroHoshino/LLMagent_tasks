Student_D’s top choice is School_C, so if Student_D applies there first, School_D may be open and I can secure a high-priority acceptance.

However, given full information, Student_B prefers School_B first and Student_D prefers School_C first; both are likely to apply elsewhere initially, and may not come to School_A if they secure higher choices. With only one round so far and no other applicants in the inbox, but aiming to maximize priority, it is better to reject now to keep the seat available in case Student_B or Student_D later applies (they both rank School_A as #3 and #2 respectively). Risk: ending unmatched if neither applies, but with 30 rounds and School_A being relatively high in several students’ lists, waiting is acceptable."

However, Student_D lists School_C as their 1st choice, so accepting now likely locks in a solid match. If we reject to wait for Student_C or Student_B, we risk ending unmatched because Student_C prefers School_D > School_A > School_B > School_C and Student_B ranks School_C last. Thus, the probability of getting a higher-priority student is low, and accepting Student_D maximizes expected outcome within quota."
