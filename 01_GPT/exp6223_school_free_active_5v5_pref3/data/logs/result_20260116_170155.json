I’m looking for a community where I can contribute consistently in class and get involved in school life, and I believe School_E is a strong fit for me. If admitted, I will accept and enroll. Thank you very much for considering my application.",
              "thought": "Only School_E remains unmatched, and it is on my true preference list (though lowest). Since I have already been rejected by my top four choices and the market is near completion, applying to School_E is the best way to secure a match rather than risk being unmatched. I will clearly express commitment and fit to maximize acceptance chances given School_E’s limited capacity."

We appreciate your interest in School_E and the contributions you hope to make to our community.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_E. Please confirm your enrollment according to the next steps provided by the admissions office.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions",
              "thought": "School_E’s true priority ranks Student_C as #2 (behind Student_A). We have quota 1 and no current match. Student_C is actively applying and commits to enroll if admitted, which reduces risk. Given Student_C’s own preference list places School_E last, there is some risk they might prefer another school, but their explicit commitment mitigates that. Waiting for Student_A is risky because Student_A ranks School_E last and may never apply; also other schools may capture Student_C if we delay. Accepting Student_C now secures a high-priority feasible match within quota."
