Although I was rejected previously, with the market narrowing there may be an opening if higher-priority students match elsewhere. I will re-apply with a concise, credible commitment statement and emphasize fit and readiness to enroll immediately if accepted."

              "thought": "As School_D, my true priority list is D > E > C > B > A, with quota 1. Student_B is 4th on my list. In earlier rounds, I rejected E, C, and B to preserve capacity in case higher-priority Student_D might apply. However, by round 4, Student_D has not contacted School_D, and Student_D ranks School_D last, making it unlikely they will apply unless rejected everywhere else. Student_E ranks School_D 4th and Student_A ranks School_D 3rd; neither is currently applying. Student_C already applied (and I rejected), but could re-apply; yet C is higher priority than B, so accepting B now risks blocking a better match if C returns. Still, there is no guarantee C will re-apply, and leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an included student. Given B’s renewed commitment and the diminishing likelihood of receiving Student_D/E/C, I should fill the seat now with Student_B to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."
