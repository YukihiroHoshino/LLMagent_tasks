With capacity 1, applying immediately risks rejection if higher-priority students apply. School_C ranks me 1st, and it is still reasonably high on my true list (4th).

School_D is my 4th choice but I am 2nd in its priority list, making acceptance very likely if I apply now. Securing a strong, likely match early is better than risking being left with School_E (my last choice) later. Therefore I will apply to School_D in round 1."

However, Student_C ranks School_D as their #1 and is my #3; Student_C may apply soon, but there is no guarantee. Student_D is my #1 but ranks School_D last, so unlikely to apply. Given quota=1 and only Student_E applying this round, accepting secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked applicant or no match."

Although Student_A is applying now and claims School_A is #1, accepting immediately would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the chance to match with Student_B or Student_D if they apply in subsequent rounds. Given full information, Student_B prefers School_A 3rd and Student_D prefers School_A 2nd, so either could plausibly approach School_A soon depending on outcomes at their top choices.

With quota 1, accepting now would lock in a mid-high option but risks missing higher-priority Student_D or Student_A, who may apply later (they each rank School_B as their 3rd choice). Given the market, Student_D is top priority for multiple schools (also top at School_D), so they may not reach us; Student_A ranks us 4th, less likely to apply early. Student_B ranks us 1st and is applying now; rejecting could lose a solid match and leave us unmatched if D/A never apply. Since B is still within our acceptable list and strongly committed, accept to secure a good outcome under uncertainty."
