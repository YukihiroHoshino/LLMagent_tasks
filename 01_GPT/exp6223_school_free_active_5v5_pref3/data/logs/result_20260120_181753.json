Student_D’s top choice is School_C (School_C ranks Student_D 3rd) and Student_D is top priority at School_B and School_D, so Student_D is likely to be taken elsewhere and may never apply to School_A. Still, to maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority student, the best move is to reject Student_A now and keep the seat open for Student_B (our top priority) should they become available; Student_A has strong outside options but may also be accepted by School_A if still available later.
