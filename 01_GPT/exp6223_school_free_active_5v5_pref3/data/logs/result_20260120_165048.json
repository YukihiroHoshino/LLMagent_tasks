With quota 1, accepting Student_C now would block me from matching with the higher-priority Student_E. There is no indication that Student_E is unavailable; in fact, they proactively applied. Therefore I should reject Student_C to preserve capacity for Student_E, aiming for the highest possible match on my true priority list."

              "thought": "My top choice is School_C, but School_C’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind Student_C, Student_B, Student_D). Those students also have strong incentives to apply there (Student_D has School_C as #1; Student_B and Student_C have it in their top 5). My best realistic shot at a high-ranked school is School_D, where I am ranked #2 in priority (only behind Student_D). Since Student_D’s top choice is School_C, there is a good chance Student_D applies to School_C first, leaving School_D attainable for me if I apply immediately. Therefore I will apply to School_D now to secure a strong match rather than likely being rejected at School_C and losing time."

However, Student_D and Student_A are higher priorities. Looking at students’ preferences: Student_D ranks School_B 3rd (after C, A) so may not apply to me early; Student_A ranks School_B 4th, also unlikely early. Student_C ranks School_B 3rd, Student_E ranks School_B 2nd. If I reject Student_B now, I risk ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply. If I accept Student_B now, I fill quota but forego possibility of matching with D or A. Given the mechanism: once I accept, I’m removed and cannot upgrade later. Still, the chance that D or A applies to me in later rounds seems low because both have higher-ranked options and those schools may accept them. Student_B has me as first choice, so accepting secures a stable match with a reasonably high-ranked student (3rd). To maximize expected outcome under uncertainty, accept Student_B."

Given the market, Student_B ranks School_A 3rd and likely applies first to School_B; Student_D ranks School_A 2nd but likely applies first to School_C. There is a meaningful chance neither B nor D applies to us this round, and even if they do later, we may already be matched and cannot switch.
