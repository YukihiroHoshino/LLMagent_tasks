Since we can reject and keep the seat open, it is strategically better to wait for higher-priority candidates rather than commit immediately to Student_B."

However, Student_C and Student_B are ranked above Student_D; if I accept now, I lose the chance to match with either if they later apply. Looking at student preferences: Student_C ranks School_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), and Student_B ranks School_C 5th (very unlikely to apply). Student_E ranks School_C 1st and is ranked 4th on my list; Student_E may apply soon and would be a worse match than Student_D. Given the low probability that Student_C or Student_B will come to me, and the risk of ending up with Student_E or no one later, it is optimal to accept Student_D now to fill my single quota with a relatively high-priority candidate."

My best strategic move is to apply to School_D: it is 4th on my list but School_D ranks me 2nd overall, so I have a strong chance to be accepted even if others apply.

Student_D's top choice is School_C (which ranks Student_C then Student_B then Student_D, so Student_D might be rejected and could apply to School_A as their 2nd choice).
