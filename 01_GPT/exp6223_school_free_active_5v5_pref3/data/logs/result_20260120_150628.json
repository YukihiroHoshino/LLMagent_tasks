However, Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks School_C 5th, making it unlikely they will apply to us early (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Given the one-shot per round constraint and uncertainty, accepting Student_D now is strategically strong and within quota."

Since my quota is 1 and an [ACCEPT] would immediately finalize a match and remove me from further negotiation, accepting Student_C now would block the possibility of matching with the higher-priority Student_E who is already applying.

Waiting for Student_D (our #1) is risky because Student_D’s last choice is School_D and they will likely apply elsewhere first; with quota 1, taking Student_E now maximizes our outcome given current offers and commitment signal."

Student_A is higher priority than Student_C, so if choosing between these two now, Student_A is preferable. However, Student_D (our top choice) has not applied yet; given Student_D’s preferences (School_C, School_A, School_B, School_E, School_D), they may apply to School_B if rejected by School_C and School_A, so there is some chance they come later. Accepting Student_A now would fill the quota and prevent taking Student_D later. But there is no mechanism described for tentative offers/holding; acceptance finalizes the match. To maximize chance of matching with highest possible on our list, we should reject now and wait for Student_D, but that risks ending unmatched if Student_D never comes. Since Student_A explicitly commits and is our #2, and given uncertainty about Student_D arriving within 30 rounds, accepting Student_A secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of an empty seat."
