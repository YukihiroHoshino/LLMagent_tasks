Waiting could allow a higher-priority student (Student_C or Student_B) to apply later, but there is no guarantee; Student_C ranks School_C 4th and Student_B ranks it 5th, making it unlikely they will reach us unless rejected elsewhere. Student_D ranks School_C 1st and is likely to commit, giving us a solid match within our quota. Given the low probability of attracting Student_C/Student_B and the risk of ending unmatched, accept Student_D now."

However, Student_B (our top choice) ranks School_A 3rd and is likely to apply first to School_B; Student_D (our 2nd choice) ranks School_A 2nd and may apply to School_C first. There is a meaningful chance that either Student_B or Student_D could become available to us in later rounds if they are rejected or displaced elsewhere. Since accepting Student_A now would immediately fill our only seat and remove us from further negotiations, it risks blocking a higher-priority match. Given we prefer a higher-ranked student and can continue searching in later rounds, we should reject Student_A now despite their strong interest."

With quota 1, accepting now would lock us in and prevent matching with higher-priority Student_D or Student_A if they approach later. Given full market info: Student_D prefers School_C then School_A then us; likely to be taken by C or A, but not guaranteed. Student_A ranks us 4th, so less likely to apply early. However, holding out one round is feasible; we can reject now and aim for D/A, accepting the risk of ending unmatched if neither comes. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should reject Student_B to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates."

Those three students all have School_C as a mid-to-low option (3rd/5th/1st respectively), so there is a real risk they apply there and I get rejected. Meanwhile, School_D ranks me 2nd, and several students have School_D very high (Student_C #1, Student_B #2, Student_A #3), so waiting could make School_D hard to get later. To maximize my chance of landing as high as possible, I should secure a strong, likely acceptance early by applying to School_D where I have high priority, rather than risk striking out at School_C and losing School_D to higher-priority applicants later."

Although Student_D (my #1) could appear later, Student_D ranks School_D last in their preferences, so the likelihood they apply to me is low unless rejected elsewhere.
