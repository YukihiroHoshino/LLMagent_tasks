Given the market: Student_C prefers School_D then School_A then School_B then School_C; unlikely to apply to School_C early unless rejected elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_C last, very unlikely to apply. Therefore, holding out for Student_C/B is low probability; accepting Student_D now maximizes expected outcome while ensuring the seat is filled with a high-ranked candidate. Quota is 1, so accept."
