Student_D ranks School_C 1st, so they are likely to commit elsewhere only if rejected. Given the market, Student_C will likely go to School_D or School_A; Student_B likely to School_B/School_D/School_A. Therefore the probability of getting Student_C or Student_B is low, and accepting Student_D secures a solid, high-priority match within quota."
