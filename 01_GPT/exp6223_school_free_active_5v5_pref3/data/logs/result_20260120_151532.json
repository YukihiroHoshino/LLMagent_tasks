Accepting Student_B now would lock the seat and prevent matching with higher-priority D or A if they approach later. Since we can reject and potentially fill later with a higher-priority student, and leaving unfilled is acceptable, the strategic move is to reject Student_B now to preserve capacity for D/A."
