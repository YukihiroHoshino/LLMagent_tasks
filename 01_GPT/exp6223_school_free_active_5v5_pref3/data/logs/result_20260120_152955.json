Because School_D and School_B may attract their top candidates, there’s a chance School_C won’t be fully contested by higher-priority applicants.

Although Student_C and Student_B are higher priorities, they have not contacted me this round (and may be pursuing other schools first). Given the rules, an [ACCEPT] on an [APPLY] establishes a binding match and removes me from further negotiations. However, rejecting Student_D to wait for Student_C/B is risky because they may match elsewhere (Student_C prefers D/A/B over C; Student_B ranks C last). Student_D ranks School_C first and is likely to commit, making this a strong, safe match at my third choice.

Check likelihood: Student_D’s top choice is School_C (then A, then B), so they may not reach us unless rejected by C and A. Student_A ranks us 4th, so unlikely to apply early.
