With quota 1 still open and only Student_E applying this round, accepting now could block a later, higher-priority student (Student_A/Student_C/Student_B) from matching with us. Given all students rank School_E last, higher-priority students are unlikely to apply early, but they may come later if rejected elsewhere. Since we can reject now and keep the seat available for a better-ranked candidate, and we prefer leaving unfilled over taking someone outside the list (Student_E is still on-list), the strategic choice is to reject to preserve optionality for higher-priority applicants."

Student_C (ranked below Student_E) previously applied and was rejected; they may return, but accepting Student_E now secures our second-highest priority and fills our single quota. Student_A is lowest on our list, so if we accept anyone now, Student_E dominates Student_A. Given Student_E’s repeated commitment and our remaining quota of 1, accepting Student_E maximizes our outcome under the current market conditions."
