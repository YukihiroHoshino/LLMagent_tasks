Given we are allowed to reject and wait, and higher-priority students have plausible paths to us (Student_D ranks School_B 3rd; Student_A ranks School_B 4th), the optimal strategy to maximize our true priority match is to reject Student_B this round and keep the seat available for higher-priority candidates."
