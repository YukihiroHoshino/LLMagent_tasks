Student_B prefers School_B then School_D, with School_A as 3rd; likely to apply elsewhere first. Student_D prefers School_C first, then School_A; may apply to School_C first. In round 1, only Student_A applied to us, indicating immediate commitment. Rejecting risks ending unmatched or settling for lower later. Accepting now secures a relatively high-priority candidate (3rd) and ends uncertainty. Given the environment where agreements are binding and remove us from further negotiations, the tradeoff is losing chance at B or D; however, probability they come to us soon is uncertain. Optimal to accept Student_A now to guarantee a good match within quota."
