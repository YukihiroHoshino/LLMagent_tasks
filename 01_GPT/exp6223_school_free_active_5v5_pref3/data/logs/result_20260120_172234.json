Student_C is our lowest-priority acceptable student, and we have already rejected their APPLY attempts. No higher-priority candidates have contacted us since Round 9, but we still cannot verify their match status; they may still apply later. Since Student_C sent [TALK], we should continue to hold the seat and provide a concrete trigger definition without committing early. A reasonable trigger is a set number of consecutive rounds with no contact plus reaching a later round threshold; keep guidance to APPLY around Round 20."
