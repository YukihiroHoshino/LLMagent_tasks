However, I prefer to keep the seat open rather than commit to a lower-ranked student if there is a reasonable chance that a higher-priority student (Student_A/Student_C/Student_B) may apply later. Given the market information, School_E is last choice for Students A/C and near-last for B, so the probability is low but non-zero; with rounds remaining until 30, holding the seat preserves the possibility of matching with a higher-priority student, which is my objective. Therefore, I should reject Student_E again this round, consistent with prior communication about fixed priorities and holding for higher-ranked applicants."

No other students are in the inbox this round, but accepting E now would block the possibility of matching with higher-priority students A/C/B if they later apply (they all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely but still possible if they become unmatched late). Since our objective is to match as high as possible on the true priority list and we prefer leaving unfilled over taking someone not on the list (E is on the list), the key tradeoff is certainty now vs potential higher-priority later. Given repeated rounds and that higher-priority students have strong outside options and place us last, the probability they apply is very low, but not zero. Still, with 13 rounds remaining, holding remains aligned with maximizing priority rank; we can accept E only if it becomes clear no higher-priority student will apply before round 30, which we cannot guarantee yet. Therefore reject again this round."
