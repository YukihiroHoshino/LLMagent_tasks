[ACCEPT]\n\nBrief overview of our daily routine & learning/play approach:\n- Arrival & settling-in: warm handoff, choice play/quiet activities.\n- Morning circle: songs, stories, sharing, simple calendar/weather.\n- Learning blocks: play-based learning with teacher-guided small groups (early language, pre-math concepts, fine-motor, art/sensory), built around children’s interests and developmental readiness.\n- Outdoor time daily (weather permitting): gross-motor + nature play.\n- Lunch + hygiene routines.\n- Rest/nap: calm, consistent routine with individualized supports.\n- Afternoon centers: pretend play, construction, art, music/movement + often a second outdoor window.\n- Closing circle + pick-up.\n\nOn drop-off/pick-up flexibility:\nWe do best with consistent timing day-to-day, but we can usually accommodate a reasonable arrival/pick-up window within our operating hours, and occasional schedule changes are fine with advance notice. If you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up times (and whether you need any extended-care coverage), I’ll confirm the exact window we can support this term.\n\nIf helpful, you can also tell me your child’s age and any routines/allergies we should plan for so we can prepare a smooth start.",

With quota 1 and only Parents A, B, C remaining unmatched, we should consider whether holding out could yield Parent_D or Parent_A. Parent_D is already matched elsewhere? Actually matched list is empty, but Parent_D is not in remaining unmatched, so Parent_D is already matched. Parent_A remains and is ranked above Parent_B, but Parent_A’s preferences place Nursery_B 3rd, behind Nursery_D and Nursery_A, so Parent_A may not apply to us. Parent_B has applied now and is willing to commit; accepting secures a reasonably high-priority match rather than risking ending unmatched or getting Parent_C (ranked below Parent_B and also ranks us last). Therefore accept and provide program overview and scheduling flexibility info to reinforce commitment."

We put a strong emphasis on social-emotional learning—helping children practice empathy, turn-taking, self-regulation, and confidence—alongside independence in daily routines.\n\n**Typical daily rhythm:** A consistent flow of arrival/settling-in, a short group gathering, small-group activities, substantial outdoor play, lunch, rest/quiet time, then afternoon choice-based exploration (often with another active/outdoor block). We keep transitions predictable and supportive.\n\n**Partnering during the first weeks:** We use a gradual settling-in plan tailored to the child (shorter initial days or phased attendance when possible), plus frequent check-ins with caregivers. We align on comfort strategies, routines (sleep, separation, meals), and communication preferences, and we adjust quickly based on what we observe.\n\nWe’d be happy to welcome your family—if you can, please reply next with your child’s age, desired start date/schedule, and any key routines or needs (e.g., nap, allergies, separation support) so we can prepare well for a smooth start.",
