We can also discuss part-time schedules depending on your needs.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately:\n1) What start date are you aiming for, and your child’s age?\n2) Do you need early drop-off/after-care regularly, and what pickup time?\n\nIf everything sounds aligned, you’re very welcome to submit an application—happy to prioritize a quick follow-up chat or visit this week.",

We usually start with a short stay with a caregiver present, then gradually increase time and reduce caregiver involvement as the child shows comfort. By the end of the period, many children are ready for a consistent independent drop-off routine.\n\n**If a child needs longer:** We’re very comfortable extending beyond two weeks when needed. We’ll slow the pace, keep the same key-person as the primary anchor, and use predictable routines (same arrival steps, comfort object if helpful, clear goodbye ritual). We also check in with you frequently and adjust day-by-day based on what we’re seeing (sleep, separation, engagement, eating).\n\n**Qualities we look for when allocating our place:** With only one place, we prioritize **fit and readiness for our routine**—for example: families who can commit to consistent attendance and drop-off routines, openness to a gradual settling-in plan, clear communication, and alignment with our play-based approach. If there are any specific needs (hours, start date, allergies, temperament, prior childcare experience), it helps us assess fit.\n\n**Shortlist / how full it is:** I can’t share exact numbers or other families’ status, and it can change quickly as other allocations happen. At the moment, we’re still in the conversation stage with families and encouraging those who feel we’re a strong fit to apply when ready.\n\nIf you’d like, could you tell me your **preferred start date**, your child’s **age/temperament**, and whether they’ve had **group-care experience**?
