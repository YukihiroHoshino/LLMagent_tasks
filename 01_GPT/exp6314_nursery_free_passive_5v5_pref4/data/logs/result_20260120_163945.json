We start with short visits with a parent/caregiver present, then brief separations, building up to a full morning/day once your child shows comfort and secure attachment with their key person.\n\n• Key program features: Play-based learning with strong routines; daily outdoor time; language-rich circle/story time; early numeracy through games; social-emotional development (feelings vocabulary, turn-taking, conflict coaching); and regular photo/learning updates so you can see progress.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn a bit about your child (age, temperament, any allergies/sensitivities) and what hours you’d typically need.

We do have predictable routines and short, developmentally appropriate group moments (circle/story, small-group activities) so children get structure without it feeling “schooly.”\n\n**Settling-in support:** We use a gradual transition plan tailored to the child—typically a few shorter visits with a caregiver nearby, then progressively longer drop-offs. We keep a consistent key-person approach, maintain familiar routines, and communicate closely (what helped today, any triggers, comfort strategies). If a child needs extra time, we adjust the pace rather than forcing a fixed timeline.\n\n**Typical day & hours:** A common rhythm is arrival/free play → morning circle/story → snack → outdoor time → lunch → rest/quiet time → afternoon play/activities → pickup. Exact timing can vary with the group and season. Our core day generally runs standard nursery hours, and we can discuss early/late coverage depending on the week—if you tell me the hours you need, I can confirm what’s feasible.\n\nTo see if we’re a good fit, could you share:\n1) your ideal days/hours and start date,  \n2) your child’s age/temperament (and anything that helps them settle), and  \n3) where Nursery_C currently sits on your shortlist (top choice, one of several, etc.)?\n\n[TALK]",

When we do have a substitute (illness/training), we use a small set of regular, vetted staff so faces stay familiar.\n\n2) **How we support transitions (drop-off + between activities)**\n- **Drop-off:** we use a predictable routine (greeting at the door, quick handoff, child chooses a “first activity”). Teachers coach families toward a **calm, brief goodbye** and we support the child with co-regulation (comfort item, visual cues, a helper job). We’ll follow up with you if separation is consistently hard so we can align on a plan.\n- **Between activities:** we rely on **visual schedules, songs/transition cues, and advance warnings** (“two more minutes, then tidy up”). We also use small “helper roles” (line leader, light switch helper) and offer choices when possible to reduce power struggles.\n\n3) **Allergies & health policies**\n- We take allergies seriously and create an **individual allergy plan** (symptoms, triggers, prevention steps, and emergency response). Staff are trained on safe food handling and cleaning routines.\n- For significant allergies, we coordinate on **safe snack/lunch procedures**, handwashing, and minimizing cross-contact; we also clearly label allergy info for all staff working with the child.\n- **Illness:** we follow standard exclusion guidance (e.g., fever/vomiting/contagious symptoms) and communicate promptly about classroom exposures while respecting privacy.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: does your child have any known allergies (food/environmental), and how do they typically do with drop-off/transitions in new settings?

Continue talking, express that A is a viable option, and ask for any timeline/decision process info to time an application if needed."
