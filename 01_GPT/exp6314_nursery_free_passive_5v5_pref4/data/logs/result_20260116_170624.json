Because we’re in an active matching process, the spot can be filled quickly once we receive an [APPLY] from a family who feels Nursery_B is a top choice.\n\n(2) What we may prioritize in the next decision round: Fit and feasibility are the main drivers—especially (a) start date alignment, (b) a schedule we can reliably support (days per week + drop-off/pick-up window), and (c) clear communication/consistency around routines. If multiple families apply around the same time, earlier start dates and more predictable schedules can be easier for us to confirm.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share:\n- your child’s age and desired start date\n- days per week needed\n- typical drop-off and pick-up times (and any variability)\n- anything essential for your child (allergies, nap needs, support needs)\n\nAnd if Nursery_B is moving into your top 1–2 choices, the best way to stay in serious consideration is to send an [APPLY] when you’re ready.",

Parent_E has not applied yet and is still comparing options, so committing now would likely block a better match. Keep them engaged but avoid accepting; provide timeline info and request specifics that would affect fit, while encouraging an [APPLY] only if we become a top choice."

Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_E), giving me a strong chance if I apply now, especially if Parent_E is pursuing D/E/C. Since applying and being accepted would secure a decent outcome versus risking ending up at B (my last choice) or unmatched, I should apply to Nursery_A this round with a strong, concise pitch."
