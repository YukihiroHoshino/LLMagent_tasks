We communicate frequently with families (quick daily updates plus check-ins) and watch closely for comfort, sleep/eating patterns, and peer interactions so we can adjust support quickly.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines/needs).

              "message": "Hello Nursery_A—thank you again for speaking with me. I’m still finalizing my decision, but Nursery_A is a serious option for our family.\n\nA couple quick questions to help me decide: (1) What does the first 2–3 weeks look like for a new child who may need a gradual transition? (2) How do you handle social-emotional moments (sharing, separation anxiety, big feelings) day-to-day? (3) What are your main communication channels with parents (daily notes/app, photos, conferences)?\n\nIf we end up joining, we’re a family that values consistency and partnership with teachers, and we’re very responsive to guidance at home to support classroom routines.",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is 4th on my true list (D, C, E, A, B). Only Nursery_A and Nursery_C remain unmatched; Nursery_C is my 2nd choice, so I should avoid committing to A unless needed. However, if I delay and someone else applies to C and is prioritized above me, I could lose C. Still, since I’m currently talking with A (no application yet) and I’m #2 in Nursery_A’s priority list (after Parent_E, who is already matched), I have strong acceptance chances at A later if C fails. Therefore, I should continue talking with A this round, signal genuine interest, and keep the option open while I try to secure Nursery_C if possible in subsequent rounds."

              "message": "Hello Parent_C—thank you for the thoughtful questions, and I’m glad Nursery_A is a serious option for your family. Based on what you shared (consistency, partnership, responsiveness), you sound very aligned with what helps children thrive here.\n\n**(1) First 2–3 weeks for a gradual transition**\nWe tailor the plan to the child, but a common approach looks like:\n- **Days 1–3:** shorter stays (e.g., 60–90 minutes) focused on building comfort with the classroom, teacher, and routine.\n- **Days 4–7:** extend to mid-morning and then toward lunch as the child shows readiness.\n- **Weeks 2–3:** move toward the full schedule, with flexibility if we see signs the child needs a smaller step.\nSupports we use throughout: a consistent “primary” teacher for check-ins, predictable routines/visual cues, comfort item from home if helpful, and quick parent touchpoints so we can adjust the plan in real time.\n\n**(2) Social-emotional moments day-to-day (sharing, separation anxiety, big feelings)**\nWe handle this proactively and calmly:\n- **Co-regulation first:** we get down at the child’s level, name the feeling, and help them settle (breathing, quiet corner, sensory tools).\n- **Clear, consistent boundaries:** gentle but firm limits (e.g., “I won’t let you hit. You can stomp your feet or ask for help.”).\n- **Coaching skills:** turn-taking language (“Can I have a turn when you’re done?”), visual timers, and teacher-guided practice during play.\n- **Separation support:** a predictable goodbye routine, quick handoff (we’ll guide you), and we redirect into a familiar activity; we also message you if a child is having a harder-than-usual drop-off so you’re not left wondering.\n- **Pattern-spotting:** if big feelings persist, we coordinate a simple plan with you (sleep, transitions, language to use at home) so the child gets the same support across settings.\n\n**(3) Communication channels**\n- **Daily:** in-person handoff at pick-up/drop-off + a brief note/message as needed.\n- **Ongoing:** periodic photo/learning updates and classroom highlights.\n- **Conferences/check-ins:** scheduled conferences during the year, and we’ll set additional meetings anytime something needs attention—our preference is to address issues early and collaboratively.\n\nTo help you finalize your decision, could you share (a) your child’s age and any known separation/transition triggers, (b) the schedule you’re hoping for, and (c) your ideal start date? If you feel we’re close, I’d also encourage you to submit an application soon so we can move to next steps promptly and reserve our remaining space for a well-aligned family.",
