We can usually accommodate **early drop-off from 8:00** and **late pick-up up to 17:00** with prior arrangement.\n\n**Occasional late pick-ups:** Yes—when it’s occasional, we can typically be flexible **if you let us know in advance** (ideally the day before, or as early as possible that morning). We just ask families to keep it infrequent so staffing stays consistent for the children.\n\n**Transitions for new children (first weeks):** We use a gentle, phased settling-in plan tailored to the child:\n- **Days 1–2:** short visits with a parent/carer present to build familiarity\n- **Days 3–5:** brief separations, gradually increasing time as your child shows readiness\n- **Weeks 2–3:** moving toward the full routine, with extra comfort supports (key-person check-ins, consistent drop-off routine)\n\nWe also do **quick daily check-ins** at drop-off/pick-up during the first couple of weeks and can schedule a short call/meeting after the first week to review how settling is going.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and any key needs (sleep/nap, separation worries, allergies), I can suggest a settling-in schedule that usually works well. And if Nursery_A is a serious contender for you, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you feel comfortable**, since we only have limited places and we’d genuinely love to consider your application strongly.",

Given low priority at E, an [APPLY] now could secure E only if higher-priority parents don’t apply; but applying doesn’t preclude later?
