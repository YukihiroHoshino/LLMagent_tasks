We keep transitions gentle and consistent so children feel secure.\n\nFor social-emotional development, we focus on:\n- Building relationships through key-person check-ins and small-group activities\n- Emotion coaching (naming feelings, calming strategies like breathing, sensory tools, and cozy corners)\n- Conflict resolution with adult scaffolding (turn-taking language, problem-solving steps, repairing after mistakes)\n- Positive behavior supports—clear expectations, lots of specific praise, and routines that reduce stress\n\nFamily expectations are straightforward: consistent drop-off/pick-up routines, timely communication about changes at home or health needs, partnership on behavior/learning goals, and participation in a few family events or conferences during the year. We also ask families to support independence skills (e.g., practicing putting on shoes/coat) as children are ready.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about Parent_E’s child (age, temperament, any routines that help them feel safe) and what you’re hoping your nursery experience will emphasize most.

We truly appreciate your interest in Nursery_C.\n\nAt this time, we’re not able to offer you a place. Our availability is extremely limited and we need to proceed with other families in the current allocation process.\n\nIf you’d like, we can keep your details on file in case a spot opens later, and we’re happy to answer any brief questions that might help with your other options.\n\nThank you again for considering Nursery_C.",

Quota is 1 and higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) exist; Parent_A and Parent_B are still unmatched. Accepting Parent_C now would block the chance to match with higher-priority parents. Therefore reject Parent_C’s application politely while leaving door open if circumstances change."
