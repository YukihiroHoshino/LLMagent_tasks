If a child is having a tough separation, we use a consistent goodbye routine and redirect quickly into a preferred activity; we’ll coordinate with you on what works best.\n- Morning rhythm: Free play → circle time → learning centers/small groups.\n- Outdoor time: Usually a mid-morning block (and often a shorter afternoon block when weather allows). We prep children with a visual/verbal heads-up (“5 minutes, then shoes”), use songs/roles (line leader, helper), and keep transition groups small to reduce waiting.\n- Lunch: Handwashing routine, consistent seating, and clear expectations; staff support independence.\n- Nap/quiet time: We do a wind-down routine (story/soft music), dim lights, and keep the room quiet. Children who don’t sleep can do calm quiet activities after a rest period.\n- Pick-up: We try to keep departures smooth with a short recap and any key notes.\n\nHow we handle transitions overall\n- Predictable routines + visual cues (simple picture schedule where helpful)\n- “Previewing” what’s next and giving choices within structure (e.g., “Do you want to put on your coat first or your shoes first?”)\n- Consistent staff responses and lots of positive reinforcement\n\nCommunication with parents\n- Daily: Brief handoff at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily note (highlights like mood, meals, nap, toileting if applicable, and a learning moment). Depending on the class, this can be via an app or a written note—either way, you’ll get something consistent.\n- Ongoing: You can message/call the office for anything time-sensitive.\n- Formal check-ins: Scheduled conferences (at least once per year) and additional meetings as needed; we also share periodic observations/learning summaries.\n\nPart-time / staggered starts\n- We can sometimes accommodate part-time schedules and staggered start dates, but it depends on current staffing and how the week is structured. If you tell me the exact days/hours you need and your preferred start window, I can say what’s feasible.\n\nTo help you compare options: what age is your child, what hours/days are you seeking (and full-time vs part-time), and when would you ideally start?

Parent_A prefers D then A then B, so they may go for A before B; Parent_D prefers D then B, but D appears already matched, so Parent_D may target B strongly. Given the risk of losing B to Parent_D, I should apply now rather than just talk, to secure a match if they’re willing, while E/A remain uncertain."
