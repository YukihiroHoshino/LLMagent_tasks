We also consider family circumstances that affect continuity (e.g., proximity and the likelihood a child can consistently attend).\n\nOn timing: we do expect our single place to be competitive and potentially fill quickly, but we’re still early in the cycle and we’re speaking with multiple families.\n\nTo help me advise you accurately, could you share your child’s age/start date needs, your weekly schedule constraints, and whether you’re looking for full-time vs part-time care? Also, are you currently prioritizing us as your first choice or weighing a couple of options closely?",
