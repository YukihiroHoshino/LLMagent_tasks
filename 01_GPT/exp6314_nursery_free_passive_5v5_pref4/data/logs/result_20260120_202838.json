We do expect to move to a decision very soon (within the next round or two). If you’d like to remain under strongest consideration, please send a brief updated [APPLY] confirming (1) your preferred start date window, (2) any constraints for orientation this week, and (3) that Nursery_A would be your first-choice if we offer the spot. That will let us finalize quickly once our availability is confirmed.",

With quota 1 and only Parent_A and Parent_C unmatched, and Parent_C ranked higher (2nd) by us, we should avoid committing to Parent_A until we see if Parent_C applies and can be matched. Parent_A is pressing for a decision; we can keep them warm with a clear near-term timeline and request an [APPLY] update, but we should not accept now."

Our child does well with consistent routines and we’re prepared to complete any enrollment steps promptly (forms/deposit) if offered a spot.\n\nCould you share a bit about your daily schedule and how you support children with transitions like drop-off and nap time?

I should not give up on C, but to avoid ending unmatched if C rejects me (I’m last in C’s priority list), I should also engage A as a backup. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Parent_E), so I have a decent chance if A is still open and Parent_E is matched elsewhere. Since I haven’t applied to A yet and it is on my list, I should apply now with a clear, ready-to-enroll commitment while staying positive."

For transitions (drop-off and nap time), we use predictable cues (visual schedule, songs, and consistent staff), a calm handoff routine at the door, and individualized settling strategies (comfort item if helpful, gradual support, and close communication with you in the first days).\n\nIf you’d like to confirm, please reply with your preferred start date window and any orientation constraints this week, and we’ll send the enrollment steps (forms and deposit) right away.\n\nWarmly,\nNursery_A",
