Typically we start with a short stay with a parent nearby, then brief separations, building up to a full morning and then a full day. For drop-off, we keep the handoff consistent (same routine, clear goodbye, a familiar comfort item if helpful) and a designated key educator supports your child through the transition. If separation anxiety shows up, we use predictable routines, reassurance, and engaging “first activity” choices to help them connect quickly.\n\n**Naps / rest**: After lunch we have a calm rest period with dim lights and quiet routines. Children who nap do so on individual mats; children who don’t sleep are offered quiet activities after a short rest. We coordinate with you on sleep needs and any comfort strategies.\n\n**Day-to-day communication**: We do quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, and we share daily updates (meals, naps, mood, activities, any concerns). If something bigger comes up, we’ll call the same day and can schedule a longer conversation.\n\n**Timeline & availability**: We currently still anticipate having **one open place**.
