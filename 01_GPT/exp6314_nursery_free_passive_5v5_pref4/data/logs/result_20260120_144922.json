If you’re available, we can also arrange a short visit or phone meeting this week to go over routines, transition planning, and any support needs. Once confirmed, we’ll send the enrollment forms and documentation checklist to finalize.\n\nWe’re looking forward to welcoming your family.",

I have already applied to Nursery_A with no response; Nursery_A’s priority ranks me last, so my chances there are weak. Nursery_C’s priority ranks me 4th; however, the higher-priority parents for Nursery_C (D, E, A) likely matched elsewhere, making acceptance plausible. To avoid ending unmatched, I should apply to Nursery_C now while still signaling fit and readiness to complete steps quickly."
