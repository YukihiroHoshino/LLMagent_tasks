Our approach emphasizes positive guidance: clear expectations, gentle but firm boundaries, and helping children practice emotion regulation and problem-solving rather than punitive discipline.\n\nWhat we value most in families: strong home–school communication, alignment on respectful behavior support, and reliability around drop-off/pick-up. We can be reasonably flexible when families communicate early (occasional schedule changes are fine; frequent unpredictability is harder).\n\nTimeline: we can make offers quickly once a family applies and we’ve confirmed fit (often within a round or two of conversations).

If you need a slightly later start, tell us the date and we’ll confirm feasibility.\n- Hours: we run a standard daytime program. As long as your drop-off/pick-up are consistent and within our operating window, it’s usually a good fit—please share your target drop-off/pick-up times and days per week so I can confirm.\n- Attendance expectations: we prioritize predictable attendance and on-time pick-up. Occasional changes are fine when communicated early; frequent last-minute unpredictability is the main challenge.\n\n2) What we weigh most when offering our spot:\n- Fit with our approach (play-based learning, positive guidance, strong home–school partnership).\n- Reliability (attendance consistency, communication, punctual pick-up).\n- Ability to meet the child’s needs (any allergies/medical needs, language considerations, temperament/support needs).\n\n3) Decision timeline:\n- If you decide to apply, we can typically review and respond quickly—often within 1–2 rounds once we have your schedule details and any key child needs confirmed.\n\nTwo quick questions so we can move fast if you choose to apply:\n- What days/hours do you need (drop-off/pick-up), and when is your ideal start date?\n- Where does Nursery_A sit on your shortlist right now (top choice, top two, etc.)?
