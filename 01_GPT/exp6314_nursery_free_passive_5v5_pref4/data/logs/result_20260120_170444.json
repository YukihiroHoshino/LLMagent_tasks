I can commit promptly to your enrollment timeline and will be responsive with any paperwork or scheduling details you need. If you’re making a decision now, I’d be grateful for your consideration.",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_C remains unmatched in round 4, so I likely remain unmatched unless I secure this spot. Nursery_C is my lowest-ranked acceptable option but still preferred to being unmatched. Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A). Since those higher-priority parents are presumably already matched elsewhere (only Nursery_C is left), applying now is the best way to secure a match rather than risking ending unmatched by waiting."

We’ll then send the enrollment packet and schedule a brief onboarding call.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C’s true priority list is D > E > A > B > C, so Parent_B is 4th (low but acceptable). Current situation shows Parent_B is the only unmatched parent and Nursery_C has 1 remaining seat; no matched yet. If we reject, we likely remain empty. Since Parent_B is on our list and applying now, accept to fill quota and secure a match."
