We do plenty of outdoor time and movement, and we weave early literacy/numeracy into play (e.g., counting in games, letter sounds through stories and name work) rather than formal worksheets. We also focus strongly on social-emotional skills—sharing, independence, and gentle conflict resolution.\n\nHours/aftercare: We run a core day program with optional early drop-off and aftercare; if you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up window, I can confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nWhat we value / who thrives here: Children who enjoy exploring and learning through play tend to flourish, and we partner best with families who communicate openly, support consistent routines, and are aligned with a warm, respectful approach to guidance.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be specific: your child’s age, any allergies/support needs, and what schedule you’re hoping for? If Nursery_A is a strong contender for you, you’re welcome to apply—our places are limited this cycle and we’re aiming to finalize matches soon.",
