Overall, we aim for a strong play-based foundation with gentle structure—children have meaningful choice, and staff intentionally extend learning through questions, modeling, and materials.\n\nSocial-emotional development: we focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking and problem-solving, and build independence through routines (tidying, self-help skills). We use consistent, calm boundaries and coaching in-the-moment (e.g., “I see you want the toy—let’s find a way to take turns”), and we partner closely with families so strategies are consistent between home and school.\n\nWhat we value when considering families: alignment with our play-based approach and daily routines, open and respectful communication, and practical fit (schedule/consistency) so the child can settle well. With only one spot, we also look for families who feel confident Nursery_A is a strong match.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what are your top priorities (hours, outdoor time, approach to behavior guidance, transition support), and what would make you feel certain about choosing a program this year?

We place a lot of emphasis on social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, expressing feelings) and building independence in age-appropriate routines.\n\nWhen reviewing families, we prioritize: (1) alignment with consistent routines and respectful communication, (2) reliability around drop-off/pick-up and timely updates if plans change, and (3) a collaborative partnership—especially around transitions, behavior support, and developmental goals.\n\nTimeline: we’re having conversations now and typically make decisions as soon as we have enough information to feel confident about fit, given we have very limited places.\n\nIf you’d like to be considered strongly, the most helpful next steps are:\n- A short note about your child (age, temperament/interests) and what you’re hoping nursery will support this year.\n- Any schedule needs (start date, hours, any constraints).\n- If possible, a brief visit/meet-and-greet so we can ensure expectations match.\nReferences aren’t required, but we’re happy to review anything you feel is relevant.\n\nIf you share the above, I can tell you what the next step would be from our side and what information we’d need for a formal application.",
