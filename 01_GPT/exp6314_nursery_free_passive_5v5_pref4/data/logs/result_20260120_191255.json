We emphasize **play-based learning** with gentle guidance and small-group activities.\n- **Outdoor time (daily):** we prioritize getting outside every day (weather permitting) for gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n- **Lunch & rest/quiet time:** calm routine, independence skills (self-help, tidying, serving with support).\n- **Afternoon:** project work (art/science/nature), story time, and social-emotional activities (emotion naming, conflict resolution with adult coaching).\n- **Pick-up:** short handover on how the day went.\n\nWhat we emphasize most:\n- **Social-emotional growth** (friendship skills, routines, confidence)\n- **Language & communication** (storytelling, songs, rich conversation)\n- **Outdoor movement** and hands-on exploration\n- **Independence** (age-appropriate self-care and responsibility)\n\nTo help me tailor details: what matters most for your child right now—outdoor time, structure vs flexibility, language support, or social confidence?
