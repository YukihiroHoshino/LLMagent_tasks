Also, any specific needs (hours, allergies, language support) we should know about?\n\nIf Nursery_C sounds like a strong fit, you’re welcome to apply when ready and I’ll take it from there.",

Accepting Parent_C is better than leaving the seat empty. However, the parent has not sent [APPLY], so I cannot finalize; I should clearly state the seat is available and that I will offer upon receiving an [APPLY] message, and give a clear conditional yes with the exact procedural requirement as the only missing step."
