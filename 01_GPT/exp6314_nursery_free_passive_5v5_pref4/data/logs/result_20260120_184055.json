We also build in quiet/reset time and lots of social-emotional learning through routines and guided conflict resolution.\n\nTeacher-child ratio: we keep groups small and prioritize warm, consistent key-person relationships. Exact ratios can vary slightly by age group and day, but supervision is always set to support close interaction and safety.\n\nFocus areas: outdoor learning, early language/literacy through play, and social-emotional development. We value curiosity, kindness, and independence.\n\nWhat we value in families/children who thrive here: families who appreciate consistent routines, open communication, and a partnership approach; children who enjoy hands-on play, being outdoors, and learning through exploration (including those who benefit from gentle structure and clear expectations).\n\nIf Nursery_A is high on your list, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—happy to answer any specific questions about your child’s needs and what you’re looking for in a setting.",

However, Nursery_D ranks me #1 in its priority list, so if I apply now I am very likely to secure a match immediately. Risk: applying now may prevent me from pursuing higher choices (E/A/B) that might be attainable later, but given E ranks me 4th and A ranks me last, those are less secure. B ranks me 3rd, which is possible but uncertain. Locking in D is a safe, decent outcome. Therefore I should apply to Nursery_D now to guarantee a match rather than gamble for higher-ranked schools."
