In the market, Nursery_A and Nursery_E are still available and are my #2 and #1, so I should preserve flexibility and not commit to Nursery_C yet. I already opened a TALK with Nursery_C in round 1; continuing TALK can keep me on their radar while I pursue A/E when paired. Also, Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind D, E, A), so a direct APPLY might be rejected if higher-priority parents apply; better to gather info and signal interest without committing prematurely."
