Nursery_E (my 2nd choice) also has me ranked 3rd, but Parent_A and Parent_D are ahead of me and could target it. Given the one-shot-per-round constraint and no prior commitments, securing Nursery_C early is a good safety move to avoid ending up with a worse option. Therefore I should apply to Nursery_C now and emphasize fit and readiness to commit."
