We focus on social-emotional development, independence (self-care routines), and collaborative play.\n\nWhat we value in applicants: strong schedule fit and reliable attendance, a supportive partnership with families, and a child’s readiness for a group setting (with appropriate support). We don’t require community involvement, but we appreciate families who communicate proactively and engage respectfully with staff.\n\nCommunication: brief daily updates plus photos/notes during the week, and we’re responsive to messages for anything urgent. We also schedule regular check-ins/teacher conferences.\n\nTo help us understand fit on our side: what schedule are you looking for (days/hours), and what are you hoping Nursery_E will provide that your top choices may not? Also, how likely are you to apply to Nursery_E if a place is available?",

If there’s anything I can provide (schedule needs, references, a short family note) to be considered appropriately, I’m happy to send it promptly.",

I previously only talked with B and C, no applications yet. I have lowest priority at Nursery_B (they rank E last), so an application to B is likely to be rejected if others apply. Nursery_C ranks me 2nd, so C is my best remaining realistic target; however, this round I’m paired with B, so I should keep the door open without committing, gather info on timeline, and signal flexibility in case B ends up available. Therefore: TALK, express continued interest, ask about likelihood/timeline and what would strengthen my candidacy."

If you decide Nursery_B is a top option for you, submitting an application/confirmation of interest sooner helps ensure you’re in the group we can consider when we move to finalize.\n\n2) **What we weigh most heavily:** When choosing among interested families, we follow our **published priority order** first (the formal priority ranking is what determines offers when space is limited). Within that framework, we also look for **program fit**—alignment with our schedule/attendance expectations, readiness for a group setting, and a collaborative family-school partnership.\n\n**What you can send that’s helpful:**\n- Your preferred schedule/attendance needs and start timing\n- Any key information about your child’s temperament, routines, and support needs\n- A short family note on what you’re seeking in a nursery environment\n\nIf Nursery_B is truly one of your top choices, you’re welcome to reply with the above details and let me know whether you’re considering applying soon—then I can advise you on next steps and keep you informed as our decision window approaches.",

At the moment we still have one potential opening, but we are actively reviewing families on a rolling basis, so we can’t guarantee the seat will remain open after this round.\n\nKey factors for making an offer are overall fit and readiness: your child’s age, temperament/needs, any routines or supports that help them thrive, and your intended start date/schedule. Timeline-wise, once we receive an application, we typically review quickly and can make a decision promptly if the place is still available.\n\nOn competitiveness: I can’t pre-judge without the basics. If you share (1) your child’s age, (2) preferred start date and days/hours needed, and (3) anything important about their temperament/supports, I can give a clearer sense of fit.
