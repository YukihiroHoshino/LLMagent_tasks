Staff use consistent, calm coaching language (e.g., “I see you’re upset—let’s take a breath and find a solution”) and we reinforce positive peer interactions. When challenges come up, we partner with families on a simple plan so home and school are aligned.\n\nCommunication with parents: You can expect brief daily updates at pickup/drop-off, plus regular written updates (weekly highlights and photos/notes of what children are working on). For anything more sensitive, we schedule a quick call or meeting promptly. We also do periodic check-ins to discuss progress and goals.\n\nHours & decisions: Our typical hours are 8:00–18:00, with core program time during the day and wraparound care available. Decision timelines are flexible early in the cycle, but once a family applies we aim to respond quickly (often within a few days) so you’re not left waiting.\n\nTo help me understand fit: what schedule are you hoping for, and are there any specific social-emotional goals or supports that matter most to your child this year?",

We balance consistency with flexibility based on the children’s needs.\n\nApproach to learning/play: Play-based and social-emotional focused. We emphasize language development, early numeracy/literacy through games and stories, hands-on exploration, and building independence (self-help skills, routines, cooperative play). Teachers observe and scaffold rather than “lecture,” and we communicate developmental progress with families.\n\nKey policies (high level): Health/safety and reliable attendance matter; we also value respectful family-school communication and timely updates for absences or schedule changes.\n\nOn what we prioritize in reviewing applicants: We look for strong family-school fit—alignment with a play-based approach, readiness for group routines, and a collaborative partnership with caregivers. We also consider the child’s needs and how our classroom composition can best support them.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share your child’s age, prior group-care experience (if any), and what you’re hoping your child gains most from nursery this year?

Because we only have a limited number of places, we *can* fill our spot early if we receive a strong-fit application from a family that’s prepared to enroll promptly. We don’t typically “wait just to wait” if everything is aligned.\n\n(2) Later applications / waitlist: Yes—if a family applies later and our place is already committed, we keep a waitlist/rolling consideration. If anything changes (e.g., a family’s plans shift), we revisit the waitlist in priority order and based on readiness to enroll.\n\nIf Nursery_A is truly in your top 1–2, the best way to protect your timing is to submit your application now. If you reply with your preferred start date plus your usual drop-off/pick-up window (even a range), we can tell you immediately what we’d need to move to an offer quickly.",

We should explain rolling offers, possibility of filling early if a strong-fit family applies, and that later applications can be waitlisted.

We also do small-group guided activities (early language, pre-literacy/numeracy through games, fine-motor projects). **Outdoor time is daily** (weather permitting), plus lunch/rest, then afternoon play and a closing circle.\n\n**Social-emotional support:** We explicitly teach routines, turn-taking, emotion naming, and problem-solving. Teachers coach children through conflicts, use consistent classroom expectations, and reinforce positive peer interactions. We also partner closely with families if a child needs extra support with transitions, separation, or regulation.\n\n**Communication with parents:** We prioritize clear, proactive communication—brief regular updates (day highlights, reminders), and we’re available for quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up. We also schedule periodic conferences and are responsive to messages for anything time-sensitive.\n\nIf you’re ready to move forward, we can confirm a few logistics (start date, schedule, any allergies/medical needs) right away and begin enrollment paperwork.\n\nWelcome to Nursery_B.",
