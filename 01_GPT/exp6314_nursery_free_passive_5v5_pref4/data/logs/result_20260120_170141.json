That said, it’s realistic for you to consider applying—especially if Nursery_C is a serious option for you. If you think you may apply later, it helps to let us know what schedule you need and how strongly you’re considering us relative to your other top choices, so we can be transparent about likelihood as the round progresses.\n\nIf you’d like, share your preferred start date and weekly schedule needs, and whether you’d apply to us if we were able to offer a place—then I can give a more concrete read on fit and timing.",

We aim for a steady balance so children can both explore freely and practice routines.\n- First weeks of transition: We use gradual, supportive transitions—clear goodbye routines, consistent key staff, and close observation of each child’s comfort cues. We coordinate with you on what helps your child settle (comfort items, timing, and any separation strategies that work at home).\n- Communication with families: We prioritize clear, regular updates—brief day-to-day notes/updates as needed, plus scheduled check-ins early on to make sure the transition is going smoothly, and periodic conferences to review development and goals.\n\nIf you’d like, please share your preferred start date and weekly schedule needs so we can confirm the logistics and next steps for enrollment paperwork.",
