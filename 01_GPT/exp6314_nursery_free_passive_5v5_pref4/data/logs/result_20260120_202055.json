We focus on smooth transitions and a calm classroom climate.\n- **Learning approach:** Play-based and developmentally appropriate, with intentional support for early language/literacy, numeracy through play, and social-emotional skills (sharing, problem-solving, self-regulation). We observe children closely and adjust activities to their interests and needs.\n- **Behavior guidance:** Relationship-based coaching (naming feelings, teaching replacement skills, guided repair after conflicts). We partner with families so strategies are consistent.\n- **Communication expectations:** We value proactive, respectful communication. Families can expect regular updates (highlights/notes), quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, and scheduled conferences; we reach out early if anything needs attention.\n\n**What we value in prospective families**\nWe’re a strong fit for families who want a collaborative partnership, consistent routines, and a shared approach to supporting independence and social-emotional growth.\n\n**Timeline / how we evaluate**\nWe have **one remaining place** and are currently speaking with a few families. We generally prioritize alignment (schedule needs, readiness for group setting, and family-school partnership) and then confirm enrollment once a family is ready to commit.\n\nTo help you decide and so we can plan responsibly, could you share:\n1) Your child’s age and start date you need,\n2) Any schedule constraints (days/hours),\n3) What matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, structure, gentle guidance, etc.), and\n4) Your decision timeline—if we looked like the best fit, would you be ready to submit an application quickly?\n\nIf you’d like, you can also tell me what you’re comparing us against so I can address the differences directly.",
