We also value clear communication and alignment with our classroom routines.\n\nOn your question about our current priority order: we do have a priority ranking and a single available place, so we can’t guarantee an offer at the “talk” stage.

              "thought": "Nursery_A is 4th on my true preference list (D, C, E, A, B). At round 3 only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched, so my top three are already taken and I need to secure a seat. Nursery_A’s priority order is E > C > D > A > B, so I am #2 and likely competitive unless Parent_E applies. Parent_E prefers D then E; with D already matched, Parent_E may target E first, making A a feasible option for me. Given scarcity and my strong priority at A, I should apply now rather than risk ending unmatched."

We’d be very happy to offer you our available seat.\n\nTo confirm fit and finalize smoothly, could you share: (1) your desired start date, (2) hours/days needed, and (3) any key routines or support needs we should plan for? If those align, we can confirm immediately and send next-step paperwork.\n\nWe’re glad you’re able to commit promptly—looking forward to learning a bit more.",

With quota 1 and only Parents_C and E unmatched, accepting Parent_C now secures a top match and avoids the risk of ending unfilled."
