If you share your preferred start date and your child’s age, I can be more specific.\n\n**Admissions timeline for the open spot**\nFor our remaining opening, we’re currently in “information + shortlisting” mode. If Nursery_B is a serious option for you, the best next step is to tell me:\n1) your child’s age and any support needs/allergies\n2) ideal start date\n3) needed hours (and whether you need any early/late days)\n\nIf that looks feasible, we can move quickly—typically we aim to confirm within the next couple of rounds once we have a clear application and basic fit details.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, could you share those three items?

I’m happy to share details.\n\n1) Daily routine (outdoor/naps/structure): We run a predictable rhythm with a balance of child-led play and gentle structure. A typical day includes: warm welcome + free play/choice centers, morning circle (songs/stories), small-group activities (language, early numeracy through games, art/sensory), and outdoor play every day (weather permitting—often more than once, with a longer outdoor block late morning or afternoon). After lunch we have a rest/nap period (we support individual sleep needs and use calm routines), then a quieter re-entry with reading/centers and a later outdoor/active option before pickup.\n\n2) Ratios & key-person approach: We use a key-person system so each child/family has a primary educator for daily check-ins and settling-in continuity, while still being supported by the full team. Our staffing follows required licensing ratios for the age group; if you share your child’s age, I can tell you the exact ratio and what the room typically looks like day-to-day.\n\n3) Early drop-off / late pick-up flexibility: We do have some flexibility depending on capacity and staffing—limited early drop-off and/or late pick-up slots can sometimes be arranged as an add-on. If you tell me the times you’d need (e.g., 8:00 drop-off vs 8:30, and pickup time), I can confirm what’s feasible right now.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately: what is your child’s age, and what start window are you considering?
