We go outdoors daily when weather allows, and we keep a consistent rhythm around meals/rest to help children feel secure.\n\nApproach to play/learning: Play-based and child-led at the core, with educators observing and extending interests (e.g., adding materials, asking guiding questions, and offering optional structured activities). We focus on social-emotional development, communication, and independence.\n\nHours/flexibility: We offer standard full-day hours with options for earlier drop-off/later pick-up depending on availability; we can discuss your exact schedule needs.\n\nTo understand fit, could you share your child’s age, any specific needs (sleep/routines, allergies, language), and what hours you’re hoping for?

Children have extended blocks for free play/centers (sensory, blocks, pretend play, art), plus short, structured routines like circle time (songs/stories), small-group activities (early language, pre-math concepts through games), and lots of outdoor/gross-motor time. We focus on social-emotional development, independence (self-help skills), and consistent classroom routines.\n\n**Drop-off / pick-up windows:** We typically offer a **morning drop-off window** and an **afternoon pick-up window** to keep transitions calm and predictable. If you share the schedule you need (days per week, preferred drop-off/pick-up times), I can tell you quickly whether it aligns with our current opening.\n\n**Transition support (first few weeks):** We use a gradual, supportive approach—clear goodbye routines, a consistent primary teacher connection, comfort items when helpful, and frequent check-ins with families. We also adjust expectations early on (shorter separations if needed, extra reassurance, predictable routines) and communicate daily about how your child is settling.\n\nIf it seems like a strong fit, I’d love to help you move quickly.
