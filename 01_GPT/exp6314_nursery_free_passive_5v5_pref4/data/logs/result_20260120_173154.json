We encourage avoiding “sneaking out,” because clarity builds trust.\n- **Key person as the anchor:** your child is met by the same lead adult whenever possible, who takes them to a familiar settling activity right away.\n- **Gradual build-up when needed:** if a child is very distressed, we can start with shorter days and extend as confidence grows (in coordination with you).\n- **Comfort + co-regulation:** we use calm presence, sensory/quiet corners, comfort items (as appropriate), and gentle engagement—then rejoin the group when ready.\n- **Tracking patterns:** we note what times/triggers are hardest (drop-off, transitions, lunch, nap) and adjust strategies quickly.\n\n**Communication to parents:**\n- **Daily handover at pick-up** with a brief summary (mood, meals, sleep, play, any worries).\n- **Daily/regular updates** (depending on age/needs) such as a short note on key moments and routines.\n- **Photos/observations:** we share periodic snapshots of learning and settling milestones (frequency can vary by week and consent/preferences).\n- **Extra check-ins during settling:** for separation anxiety specifically, we proactively offer a quick mid-morning reassurance update in the early days if that helps you.\n\n**Family participation/volunteering expectations:**\n- No mandatory volunteering requirement. We **welcome** involvement (e.g., sharing a cultural tradition, reading a story, helping at occasional events), but we understand family schedules and keep participation **optional**.\n- What we *do* ask is partnership: consistent routines, timely communication, and letting us know about changes at home that might affect your child’s day.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: how old is your child, and what does separation typically look like (crying at the door, clinging, difficulty calming, or trouble at transitions)?

We also schedule longer check-ins after the first couple of weeks to review how settling-in is going.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, could you share your **ideal start date** and **weekly schedule/needed hours** (and any allergies/medical notes)?
