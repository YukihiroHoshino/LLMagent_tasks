We balance child-led play with educator-guided small groups to support early language, social-emotional skills, and early numeracy/literacy in age-appropriate ways.\n- Approach: Play-based learning with a strong focus on routines, independence (self-care, tidying, turn-taking), and positive behavior support.\n- Key policies: Clear illness/exclusion guidance, consistent pickup authorization procedures, and regular parent communication (updates plus scheduled check-ins).\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what matters most to your family (hours/commute, settling-in support, outdoors, structure vs. flexibility), I can be more specific about fit.

Yes — we are able to finalize and issue the offer today.\n\nThe exact step we need from you now is a formal application in this chat: please reply with [APPLY] and include:\n1) your earliest possible start date (or a 1–2 week start window), and\n2) any fixed scheduling constraints (days/hours).\n\nNo call or additional documents are needed before we confirm. Once we receive your [APPLY], we will confirm immediately and then send the enrollment paperwork and any deposit details the same day.",

However, it is round 30 (final round) and Parent_A is the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with a listed parent. Parent_A also ranks us first and is ready to commit immediately, so we should prompt an APPLY and then accept if received."
