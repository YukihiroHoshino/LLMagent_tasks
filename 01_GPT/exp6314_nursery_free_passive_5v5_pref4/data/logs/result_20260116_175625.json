I’m happy to share more detail, and I’ll be transparent that we’re moving quickly as families apply.\n\n**Daily routine & learning approach**: We’re primarily **play-based with gentle structure**. Each day has a predictable rhythm (arrival/settling-in, morning circle, free-choice learning centers, outdoor play, lunch, rest/quiet time, afternoon small-group activities, pick-up). Within that routine we do short, intentional moments for early language, number sense, music/movement, and social-emotional learning—so children get both freedom and consistency.\n\n**Transitions & separation support**: We use a **gradual settling-in plan** tailored to the child (short initial stays, consistent handoff routine, a key-person approach, and clear goodbye scripts). We coach families on what helps most (predictability, brief confident goodbyes, comfort item if needed). We also watch closely for signs of stress and adjust pacing—our goal is a secure attachment to staff and a calm, confident drop-off.\n\n**Communication with parents**: We prioritize frequent, practical communication—typically **daily quick updates at pick-up**, plus **regular messages/photos/notes** about activities and milestones. We also schedule **check-ins during the first weeks** and then periodic conferences (and of course ad-hoc meetings anytime something comes up). If there’s a concern (sleep, eating, behavior, peer issues), we flag it early and collaborate on a plan.\n\n**What we prioritize in families**: Reliability and partnership—**consistent attendance/punctuality**, responsiveness to messages, and alignment on routines/behavior expectations. We also value families who communicate openly about any needs (allergies, developmental support, language needs), so we can plan well.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: (1) your preferred start date, (2) typical hours/days needed, and (3) any key support needs—then I can confirm fit right away.
