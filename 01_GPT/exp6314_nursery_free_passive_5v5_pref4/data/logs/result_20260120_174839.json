We assign a key person to your child, keep communication frequent in the first weeks, and adjust pacing based on how your child is coping.\n\nTimeline for offers: we can move quickly once a family applies—typically we confirm decisions shortly after we’ve spoken and reviewed fit, rather than waiting until the very end of the cycle.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and your preferred start date/schedule, and we can outline what a settling-in plan would look like for your situation.

After reviewing our current applicant pool for our single available place, we won’t be able to move forward with an offer to your family at this time.\n\nI truly appreciate your interest in Nursery_A, and I’m sorry we can’t accommodate you this year. If you’d like, you’re welcome to share a brief note with your preferred start date and schedule needs, and we can keep it on file in case circumstances change unexpectedly.\n\nWishing you the very best with your placement search.",

Reject while keeping tone respectful and encouraging them to pursue other options; cannot accept given priority strategy."

Since Nursery_A is also unmatched but I already applied there, this is the best moment to pursue Nursery_E directly."

We’ll then schedule a short visit/intro call and send the enrollment forms immediately.\n\nWe’re looking forward to welcoming your family to Nursery_E.",

We’re also happy to contribute to the community (volunteering, events, and supporting classroom needs). If there are any specific criteria you prioritize most for your single place this year, I’m glad to confirm how we meet them, and we can commit quickly if offered.",

My earlier top option among remaining was Nursery_E, where I already applied; Nursery_A is still available and I previously only talked. With only A and E unmatched, delaying risks ending unmatched if E rejects and A fills with someone else. Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_E), which gives me a strong chance if I apply now, especially if Parent_E is pursuing/held elsewhere. Therefore I should apply to Nursery_A now, emphasizing reliability and fit, and signaling readiness to commit."
