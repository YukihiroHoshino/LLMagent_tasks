We’ll then send the brief enrollment steps and paperwork timeline.\n\nWe’re looking forward to partnering with your family.",

Parent_E is unmatched and is applying with stated willingness to commit promptly. Accepting now secures a top-priority match; waiting for Parent_D (rank 1) is risky because Parent_D ranks Nursery_C third and may match with Nursery_D or Nursery_B. Therefore, accept Parent_E."
