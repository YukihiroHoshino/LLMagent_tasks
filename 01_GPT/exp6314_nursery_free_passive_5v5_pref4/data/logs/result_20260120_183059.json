We focus on social development through guided peer interactions (turn-taking games, cooperative play in small groups, and supported conflict resolution using simple language and visual cues). Staff model emotion-labeling and help children practice requesting, sharing, and problem-solving.\n\nCommunication with families: We prioritize frequent, two-way communication—brief daily updates at drop-off/pick-up, and regular written/photo updates about activities and developmental highlights. If a child is working on specific social/communication goals, we align with families on consistent strategies and check in regularly.\n\nDemand & timing: With a single spot, interest can be high and decisions can move quickly. If Nursery_B is a serious option for you, I’d recommend submitting an application as soon as you feel comfortable, rather than waiting—early applications help ensure you’re considered before the place is filled.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and anything you’re hoping for most (e.g., language support, easing separation, peer confidence).

We also share quick updates so you know how your child is adjusting.\n\nHours & flexibility: typical hours are 8:00–18:00. Standard drop-off is 8:00–9:30 and pick-up 16:00–18:00, and we can usually accommodate earlier/later within that window with advance notice.\n\nIf helpful, tell me your child’s age and any specific needs (sleep routine, separation anxiety, allergies), and what schedule you’re hoping for—then I can be more precise about how we’d support them.

We use play as the main vehicle for learning—staff observe children’s interests and extend them with gentle invitations (e.g., adding language, problem-solving prompts, turn-taking games).\n\n**Social-emotional development:** We focus on warm, consistent relationships and predictable routines. Staff coach children through emotions and peer conflicts using age-appropriate language (naming feelings, offering choices, supporting repair/apologies), and we build independence through small responsibilities and consistent boundaries.\n\n**Communication with families:** We prioritize regular, practical updates—brief check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when possible, periodic written updates about what children are exploring, and scheduled parent meetings to discuss progress and any support needs. If something important comes up (wellbeing, adjustment, behavior), we contact families promptly to align on a plan.\n\n**Demand & decision timeline:** We have **one place**, and demand can be high. We don’t decide based on “who asked first,” but we can only consider families who submit a formal application. Once an application is received, we review promptly and will confirm an outcome as soon as we’re able; the place may fill quickly if we receive an application that fits our current priorities.\n\nIf Nursery_C is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply when ready.
