              "thought": "Parent_C is last remaining unmatched and is on Nursery_C’s true priority list (lowest rank but acceptable). With quota 1 and final round, leaving spot unfilled is worse than matching with an included parent. Parent_C has repeatedly expressed immediate acceptance but has not provided the required child details; since they sent [TALK], I cannot finalize [ACCEPT] yet. I should give a clear, final instruction and immediate acceptance conditional on receiving details + [APPLY], emphasizing we are not waiting on anyone else and this is the last chance in round 30."
