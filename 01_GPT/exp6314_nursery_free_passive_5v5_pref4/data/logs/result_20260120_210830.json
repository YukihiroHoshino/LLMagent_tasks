Our daily routine is play-based with clear learning goals: we set up guided activity stations (language/story time, early numeracy through games, sensory and creative arts, and outdoor gross-motor play) and rotate in small groups so children get both independence and gentle structure. We focus on social-emotional development (turn-taking, self-help skills, and confidence) alongside early literacy and problem-solving.\n\nFor communication, we use a consistent parent-update system: a brief daily note (meals, naps, mood, highlights), weekly photos/learning snapshots, and scheduled check-ins each term—plus we’re always available for quick chats at drop-off/pick-up or to set up a call if something needs more time.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and what you value most (e.g., outdoor time, structure vs. flexibility, language support), I can describe how we’d tailor the day.
