We’d be very happy to share details and help you compare.\n\n**Typical daily schedule & approach (play-based, structured routines):**\n- **Arrival & settling/choice play** (free play with teacher-guided invitations)\n- **Morning circle** (songs, stories, language-building, social routines)\n- **Learning centers / small groups** (art, sensory, construction, early literacy/numeracy through games, fine-motor work)\n- **Outdoor time** (daily when weather allows)\n- **Lunch**\n- **Rest/quiet time** (with flexible support for children who don’t sleep)\n- **Afternoon snack**\n- **Outdoor/free play + project time** (often child-led themes, collaborative play)\n\nOur educational approach is **guided play**: teachers set up rich environments and gently extend children’s language, problem-solving, and social-emotional skills, while keeping the day predictable and calm.\n\n**(1) Teacher-to-child ratio / class size:**\nWe keep groups intentionally small. Our typical classroom is **up to ~10–12 children** with **2 educators** present for most of the core day (ratio roughly **1:5–1:6**). If you share your child’s age and the days/hours you need, I can confirm the exact group setup for that cohort.\n\n**(2) Settling-in (transition) support:**\nWe use a **gradual settling-in plan** tailored to each child:\n- Short initial visits with a parent/caregiver present\n- Gradually increasing independent time over several days\n- A consistent key educator to build trust\n- Clear goodbye routines and comfort strategies (transitional object, visual schedule)\n- Frequent check-ins with families in the first 2 weeks to adjust pacing\n\n**(3) Meals, outdoor time, and allergies:**\n- **Meals/snacks:** we follow a child-friendly, balanced approach; specifics can be nursery-provided or family-provided depending on the schedule/room. We can clarify what applies to your preferred program hours.\n- **Allergies:** we take allergies seriously—individual allergy plans, ingredient checks, staff awareness, and practical measures to reduce cross-contact. Please tell us any allergies (and severity) so we can confirm accommodations.\n- **Outdoor time:** we aim for **outdoor play every day** (weather permitting) because it supports regulation, motor skills, and wellbeing.\n\nIf Nursery_A is becoming a leading option for you, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you feel ready** so we can consider you formally. Could you share: **your child’s age, desired start date, and your preferred hours/days** (and any allergies)? That will let me give you the most accurate details and next-step timing.\n\n[TALK]",
