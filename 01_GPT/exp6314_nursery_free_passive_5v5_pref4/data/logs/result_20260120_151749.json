We’re looking for a warm, structured setting with strong support for social-emotional growth and early language through play. If accepted, we’re ready to confirm immediately and complete any required paperwork right away. Could you share the next steps/timeline you use to finalize enrollment decisions, and anything you especially value in incoming families?",

By round 3 only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched, so I should secure a high-ranked option now rather than risk ending unmatched. I already applied to Nursery_E earlier but have no acceptance yet. Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me last, so I may be rejected if higher-priority parents apply; however, those parents likely pursued Nursery_D/E first and may already be matched. Since this is my first contact with Nursery_A and I’m allowed to apply, I should apply immediately and signal strong commitment and quick turnaround to improve acceptance chances."

Your priorities around a warm, structured setting with social-emotional growth and language-rich play align well with Nursery_A.\n\nNext steps/timeline: if we move forward, we confirm placement immediately in this round, then (1) send our enrollment packet the same day, (2) schedule a brief family intake call to align on routines/supports, and (3) finalize start date and transition plan once paperwork is complete.\n\nWhat we value most in incoming families is a collaborative home–school partnership (clear communication and consistency with routines), and a thoughtful understanding of your child’s temperament and what helps them thrive during transitions.\n\nWe’d be happy to welcome your family. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_B is on Nursery_A’s true priority list but ranked last (#5). Remaining unmatched parents are B and C; C is ranked #2 for us and has been engaging, though they have higher-ranked preferences (D, C, E) and may not apply. Parent_B is applying now and can confirm immediately, which reduces risk of ending unmatched. With quota 1 and uncertainty about securing Parent_C, a conservative strategy is to accept Parent_B now to lock in a match rather than gamble on Parent_C applying later."
