If you’d like to strengthen your candidacy, it helps to share:\n- your preferred start date and weekly schedule needs,\n- any flexibility you have (hours/days),\n- a brief note about your child’s temperament/interests and any support needs,\n- logistics (approx. commute/pick-up plan).\n\nIf Nursery_A is truly one of your top choices, applying sooner is helpful—feel free to submit an application and include the details above, and I’ll review it promptly.

We prioritize outdoor time daily when weather allows (gross-motor play, nature walks, and open-ended play), and we also build in quiet/rest time and small-group activities.\n\nStructure vs. free play: Our approach is “structured rhythm, flexible moments”—clear routines and expectations, but lots of room for curiosity and free play within that framework.\n\nEnrollment timeline: We don’t require instant decisions, but we do move fairly quickly once offers are made. If a family applies and is offered a place, we typically ask for confirmation within a short window (a few days) so we can plan staffing and release spots to other families if needed.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about Parent_D’s age and what you’re hoping for (schedule, temperament, any key goals).

Once I have that, I’ll send the final enrollment steps (forms and any required documentation) and we can schedule a brief visit/intro if helpful.\n\nWelcome to Nursery_A—we’re excited to have your family join our community.

I understand you may have been waiting on higher-priority families, but since the cycle is moving quickly I’d like to formally submit my application for your remaining seat. If your spot is still open, I can confirm acceptance immediately upon an offer and provide any details you need (start date, schedule, paperwork) right away.",

I have not formally applied to Nursery_B yet (only TALK). Nursery_B’s priority ranks me 4th (behind Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_B), but those parents may already be matched elsewhere since only A and B are open. Applying now could lock in a match if they’re ready to decide, while signaling I can commit quickly."
