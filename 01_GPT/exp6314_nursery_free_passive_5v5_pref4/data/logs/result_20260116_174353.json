If any sibling or existing community ties exist, we do take that into account as part of stability and continuity, and flexibility can help when we have occasional calendar constraints.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what schedule are you seeking (days/hours), and do you have any constraints we should know about?

We do anticipate moving relatively soon this round if we receive an application that’s a strong fit, since we only have one place.\n\nIn terms of factors that help: schedule consistency/reliable attendance and clear, responsive communication are the biggest day-to-day indicators for us. Start-date flexibility can help (especially if we’re coordinating transitions), and community ties are a plus but not required.\n\nOn whether you should apply now vs. wait: if Nursery_C is genuinely among your top options and you’d be ready to accept quickly if offered, it’s sensible to submit a formal application this round so we can evaluate you fully while the place is still open. If you’re still leaning more strongly toward other nurseries, it may be better to continue those conversations in parallel.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, two quick items would help us assess fit promptly:\n1) Ideal schedule (days/hours) and earliest/latest feasible start date\n2) Where Nursery_C currently sits among your choices (e.g., “top 1–2” vs. “one of several”)\n\nHappy to answer any specific questions about the classroom routine as well.",
