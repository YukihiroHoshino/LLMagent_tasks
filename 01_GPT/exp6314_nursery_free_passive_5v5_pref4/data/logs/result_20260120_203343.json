Since this is the final round and Nursery_A is still the remaining open place, I want to confirm as clearly as possible that Nursery_A is one of our very top choices and, if you offer us the spot, we will accept immediately and fully commit (we will stop pursuing any other options). We’re fully flexible on start date and schedule, and can complete any required paperwork/references and any deposit today. If there is one final item you need from us to finalize your decision right now (hours needed, start date, forms, references), please tell me and I will respond immediately. Thank you again for considering our family. [TALK]",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is my 2nd choice and the only remaining unmatched nursery in the final round. I already applied earlier, so I cannot apply again under the rules. Given Nursery_A’s priority order ranks Parent_A above Parent_B, and other parents likely matched elsewhere, the best move is a final, clear commitment signal and a prompt for any remaining requirement so they can accept immediately if they are still deciding."

Since this is the final round, we can only finalize a placement if we receive ONE official message from you tagged [APPLY] (that’s the item we need on record).\n\nPlease reply immediately with [APPLY] and include (short bullets are perfect):\n- Child’s age:\n- Earliest/preferred start date (and any flexibility):\n- Needed schedule (days/hours), even if flexible:\n- Any allergies/medical needs or learning/support considerations:\n- Primary caregiver name + phone/email:\n- Emergency contact name + phone:\n\nAs soon as we receive that [APPLY], we will respond right away with our final decision.",
              "thought": "We are Nursery_A with quota 1 and only Parent_A remains unmatched in the final round. Parent_A is on our priority list (4th of 5), so we can consider matching rather than leaving the seat empty. However, per protocol we can only form an agreement if Parent_A sends [APPLY] and we respond [ACCEPT]. Parent_A continues to send [TALK] and has not provided required basic details; we should request a final [APPLY] and provide a copy/paste template, making clear we cannot finalize without it."
