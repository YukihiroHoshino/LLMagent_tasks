Start window: ___. Typical hours (drop-off/pick-up): ___. Any key notes (allergies/medical, naps, separation routine, languages): ___.\n\nAs soon as your **[APPLY]** comes in, I will respond immediately with **[ACCEPT]**.

However, it is round 30 (final round) and Parent_C is the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an eligible parent on our list. Parent_C has repeatedly expressed readiness to commit but has only sent [TALK], so we cannot legally send [ACCEPT] without an [APPLY]. We should give a definitive offer contingent on receiving [APPLY] immediately, with a simple copy/paste template, and clarify that if no [APPLY] arrives this round we cannot finalize."
