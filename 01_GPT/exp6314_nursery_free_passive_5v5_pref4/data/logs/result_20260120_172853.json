I’m glad to share more.\n\n1) Social-emotional development & behavior guidance\n- We explicitly teach SEL skills (naming feelings, turn-taking, problem-solving, empathy) through stories, role-play, and in-the-moment coaching.\n- Guidance is positive and consistent: clear expectations, predictable routines, and lots of reinforcement for pro-social behavior.\n- When challenges come up, we focus on the “why” (tired, transition, language/frustration) and respond with calm co-regulation first, then coaching.\n- We use natural/logical consequences where appropriate (e.g., helping repair/clean up, practicing gentle hands) and we avoid shaming.\n- For recurring patterns, we coordinate with you on a simple shared plan so home/school responses are aligned.\n\n2) Communication with families\n- Daily: quick handover at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily update (highlights, mood, meals/rest, any notable moments).\n- Ongoing: message channel for questions/updates, and we reach out promptly if something needs attention.\n- Structured: scheduled check-ins/conferences during the year, with goal-setting and developmental observations.\n- If concerns arise (behavior, separation anxiety, speech/language), we propose a plan, agree on what to try, and review progress together.\n\n3) Qualities we prioritize when selecting families\n- Partnership mindset: open, respectful communication and willingness to collaborate.\n- Consistency and reliability with routines (especially around arrivals/pick-ups and transitions).\n- Shared expectations around positive guidance (calm, consistent approaches).\n- Responsiveness if we flag something—working with us early tends to help children most.\n\nTo make sure I’m advising you well: what age is your child, and what are the top 2–3 “must-haves” for your nursery (e.g., structure, outdoor time, gentler transitions, language support)? Also, where does Nursery_C currently sit on your shortlist—and what would need to be true for you to feel ready to apply?\n\n[TALK]",
