I already applied to Nursery_E earlier, so I cannot apply again; I should use TALK to reaffirm strong interest, signal willingness to commit quickly, and ask about timeline/likelihood given remaining unmatched agents.

We are not in a position to confirm the offer in this message, but you remain under active consideration while we finalize the spot.\n\nIf you’d like to formally apply again this round, you can—just send [APPLY] and include the details above so we can review quickly.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is last on Nursery_E’s true priority list, so I should not accept unless no better option is realistically attainable. Only Parent_A and Parent_C remain unmatched. Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th and likely prefers Nursery_D/A/B first; however, Nursery_D’s top priority is Parent_B (already likely matched elsewhere) and Nursery_A’s top is Parent_E, etc., so Parent_A may end up applying to Nursery_E if rejected elsewhere. Since Parent_A is our top priority, I should keep the spot open and encourage Parent_A to apply, while keeping Parent_C warm with a clear timeline and request for info, but without committing."

Nursery_E ranks me 1st in priority, making E very likely to accept if I apply now. Since E is still on my preference list and securing a match is better than risking being left unmatched if A doesn’t come through, I should apply to Nursery_E now while the slot is available."
