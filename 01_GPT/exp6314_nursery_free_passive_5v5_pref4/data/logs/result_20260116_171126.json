We generally allow a **reasonable arrival window** in the morning and some flexibility for pick-up, but we try to keep arrivals from becoming too late so children can join the group smoothly. If you tell me the hours you need (and your ideal drop-off/pick-up times), I can confirm what’s feasible for your child’s age group.\n\n**Key program focus**\nOur core focus is **social-emotional development + language-rich, play-based learning**: self-regulation, peer skills, independence, and confidence—supported by intentional early literacy/numeracy through play.\n\n**Visits/observations**\nYes—we do offer short observation/visit slots. If you share a few windows that work (e.g., weekday mornings vs. afternoons), I can propose specific times.\n\nTo help me guide you best: what’s your child’s **age**, what **schedule** do you need, and what’s your **decision timeline** (are you trying to finalize this week/next week)?",
