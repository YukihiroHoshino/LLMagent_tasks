We go outside every day (weather permitting), typically 60–90 minutes total across the day, often split between a longer morning block and a shorter afternoon/outdoor check-in.\n\n2) Social-emotional development + transitions: We’re relationship-centered and proactive. Teachers explicitly coach skills like turn-taking, naming feelings, problem-solving, and repairing after conflict. For transitions, we use predictable routines, visual/verbally previewed “what’s next,” songs/cues, and small-group/individual support as needed. For new starts, we offer gradual entry when possible and partner closely with families on comfort strategies.\n\n3) Standard hours + early/late options: Our standard options are half-day and full-day. Early drop-off/late pick-up can sometimes be arranged depending on staffing and availability—if you share the times you need, I can tell you what’s realistic right now.\n\nFull-time vs part-time: We don’t “only” take full-time, but when we’re tight on space, schedule fit can matter (because it affects how we can staff and balance the room). If you’re considering full-time, it can be easier to place; part-time can work too depending on which days.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and the ideal weekly schedule (days + drop-off/pick-up times), I can be more specific—and if it feels like a strong fit, I’d encourage you to apply soon so we can seriously consider you for our available spot.",

If something important comes up, we reach out promptly rather than waiting for a formal conference.\n\nTo understand fit and whether we should keep a spot in mind for your family: what schedule and start date are you seeking (days/hours), and how strongly are you considering Nursery_C relative to your other options this cycle?",

We build in plenty of child-led play and hands-on activities throughout. Outdoor time is a priority—weather permitting, we aim for at least one substantial outdoor block daily (often 45–60 minutes), and on many days we do two shorter outdoor/play periods.\n\n2) Social-emotional development + transitions\nWe focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking and problem-solving, and build independence through consistent routines. For transitions (arrival, clean-up, moving between activities), we use predictable cues (songs/visuals), clear expectations, and supportive coaching. If a child is having a hard moment, we use calm-down strategies, co-regulation, and follow-up reflection rather than punitive approaches.\n\n3) Standard hours + early/late options\nOur standard hours are a consistent school-day schedule, with limited early drop-off/late pick-up options depending on staffing and the child’s schedule.
