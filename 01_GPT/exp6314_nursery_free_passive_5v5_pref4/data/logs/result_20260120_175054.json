We aim for outdoor time every day when weather allows, typically as a substantial block rather than a quick break, followed by lunch and a rest/quiet period, then afternoon activity stations and pickup.\n\nStart dates & settling-in: We’re usually able to offer some flexibility on start timing, and we strongly support a gradual settling-in plan (e.g., shorter first days, a parent-supported transition if helpful, then building to the full schedule over several days).\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age, preferred start window, and whether you need full-time or part-time hours, I can confirm what we can accommodate right now and suggest a settling-in schedule.

While I have been exploring a few options, I would be very happy to enroll at Nursery_C if offered, and I can confirm immediately and submit any required documents (and deposit, if applicable) right away. Please let me know if there’s any additional information you need or if a short visit/meeting would be helpful. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is my 5th (last) acceptable option, but it is still on my list and we are already in round 5 with only Nursery_A and Nursery_C unmatched. I have already applied to Nursery_A, but Nursery_A ranks me last in its priority list, so my chances there are weak if any higher-priority parent becomes available. Nursery_C ranks me 4th out of 5; not great, but potentially workable if others are matched elsewhere. Given the risk of ending unmatched, I should apply to Nursery_C now to secure a fallback, while keeping Nursery_A as the preferred outcome if it later accepts."

              "thought": "Nursery_C true priority: D > E > A > B > C. Remaining unmatched parents are B and C; D/E/A are already matched elsewhere or unavailable. We previously rejected C, who is lowest on our list. Parent_B is ranked 4th and is applying now with willingness to commit immediately. With quota 1 and only B/C left, accepting B secures a better outcome than risking ending with C or unfilled. Therefore accept and move to finalize logistics."
