I’m Parent_B, and we’re looking for a stable, nurturing environment with clear communication and a consistent daily routine. If accepted, I’m happy to promptly complete any paperwork and discuss how we can best support your classroom community. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is last on my true preference list, but only Nursery_A and Nursery_C remain unmatched in round 3, so I need to secure a placement. I have already sent two TALK messages to Nursery_C without a response in the provided history; continuing to TALK risks losing time. Applying to Nursery_C now can lock in a match if they accept. Nursery_C’s priority ranks me 4th (after Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A), but those parents likely matched elsewhere since only A and C are left unmatched. Therefore, acceptance chances are good and this is a reasonable compromise given limited remaining options."

Based on what you’ve shared (stable, nurturing environment, clear communication, and a consistent routine), I believe Nursery_C can be a good fit, and we’d be happy to move forward.\n\nNext steps: please send (or be ready to provide) your child’s age/date of birth, any relevant care notes (allergies, sleep/eating routines), your preferred start date, and your best contact details for paperwork and orientation scheduling. We’ll also confirm expectations around drop-off/pick-up routines and communication cadence so we start smoothly.\n\nWe look forward to partnering with you. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_B is on Nursery_C’s true priority list (4th of 5), so acceptance is allowed. With quota 1 and only Parent_B and Parent_C unmatched, compare: Parent_C is ranked 5th (lowest) for Nursery_C, while Parent_B is ranked 4th. Thus Parent_B is preferable to Parent_C. Also, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, but they are applying now, indicating willingness to match. Accept to secure a better-ranked parent and avoid ending with a worse option or no match."
