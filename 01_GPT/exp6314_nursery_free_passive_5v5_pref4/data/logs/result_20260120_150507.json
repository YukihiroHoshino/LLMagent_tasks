We also try to be flexible where we can, but schedule reliability matters.\n\nA few quick questions to see if we’re a good fit this year:\n- What schedule do you need (days/hours), and when would you ideally start?\n- How long is your commute to our location and what does drop-off/pick-up look like for you?\n- Any specific supports or preferences (language environment, allergies, nap needs, separation anxiety)?\n\nIf you share those details, I can tell you more specifically how well we can accommodate your needs and what the next steps would look like.",

Could you share what factors most influence your decisions among interested families (e.g., start date flexibility, schedule/coverage needs, sibling/community ties, willingness to commit through the year)? Also, we’re flexible on start date and can accommodate your preferred routines—are there any specific needs this year where our family could be a particularly strong match?",

However, Nursery_A’s priority list ranks me last, so an immediate [APPLY] is likely to be rejected if higher-priority parents apply. Since we’re still early (round 3) and I haven’t spoken with Nursery_A beyond an initial [TALK], I should continue to signal strong interest and flexibility to improve my chances, while keeping the option to apply to Nursery_E later (my top choice) if available. A well-crafted [TALK] can communicate commitment and fit without risking an early rejection that could reduce leverage."
