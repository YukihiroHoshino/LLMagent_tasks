We balance child-led play with gentle guidance from teachers.\n\nApproach to learning/play: play-based and social-emotional focused, with lots of language development, early numeracy through games, art/music, and hands-on exploration. We also emphasize outdoor time and positive behavior support.\n\nHours/flexibility: we typically offer standard drop-off/pick-up windows, and can often accommodate earlier drop-off or later pick-up depending on staffing and demand—if you share your ideal hours, I can tell you what’s realistic.\n\nWhat we value in applicants: fit and consistency—families who align with a play-based approach, communicate openly with staff, and can support regular attendance. If relevant, we also consider schedule needs and how we can best support your child’s transition.\n\nTo help me advise you: what hours are you hoping for, and what are the top 1–2 things you’re looking for in a nursery (e.g., outdoor time, structure, language support, proximity)?",

Remaining unmatched nurseries are A and C; I previously applied to C and it’s my 2nd choice, so I should keep that option open. However, if C is likely to take someone else, I risk ending unmatched. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Parent_E), which gives me a decent chance if I apply now. Since I have not applied to Nursery_A yet and it is on my list, I should apply to secure a fallback while signaling strong commitment."

Could you share where you are in your decision timeline and what factors you weigh most when choosing among families (e.g., schedule fit, start date flexibility, alignment with your approach)?
