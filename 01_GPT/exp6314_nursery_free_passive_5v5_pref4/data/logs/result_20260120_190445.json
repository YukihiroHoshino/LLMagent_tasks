We’re ready to confirm enrollment promptly if offered, and we’re flexible on start date and scheduling. If there’s any additional information you’d like (availability, paperwork, or a brief family summary), I’m happy to share immediately.",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is 4th on my true list (above only Nursery_B). However, it is the only nursery still unmatched in round 4, so waiting risks ending unmatched. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (behind Parent_E). Since other matches likely removed Parent_E or they may already be matched elsewhere, my acceptance chances are reasonable. I have only talked previously and have not applied yet, so I should apply now and signal readiness to enroll immediately to strengthen the offer."

We’re happy to offer you our available spot.\n\nTo finalize, please reply with: (1) your preferred start date (and earliest/latest flexibility), (2) the weekly schedule you anticipate (days/hours), and (3) any key pickup/drop-off constraints or support needs. We’ll then share the enrollment packet and next-step timeline right away.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is 2nd on Nursery_A’s true priority list (very high). It is round 4, only Parent_C remains unmatched, and Nursery_A still has its full quota (1). Accepting now secures a highly desired match with no downside risk of waiting."
