Teachers coach children through peer interactions, use consistent classroom routines, and partner with families on shared strategies.\n\nKey policies/logistics: standard full-day hours with options for early drop-off/aftercare (availability can vary), and we emphasize clear communication, health/safety guidelines, and gradual transitions for new children.\n\nA couple quick questions to help me advise you well: what age is your child, and what schedule (standard day vs. needing aftercare) are you hoping for? If Nursery_A is among your top choices, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel ready so we can seriously consider you.\n\n[TALK]",

Given Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me 4/5 (ahead of Parent_E only), my acceptance chances depend on whether higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_B) apply there. Since other unmatched nurseries include Nursery_E (my 3rd choice) and Nursery_A (4th), I should avoid locking into my last choice too early. Best move: continue TALK to keep option open and gather any info about current interest/likely competition before deciding to APPLY later if needed."

We review for (1) schedule/needs fit, (2) readiness for our routines and social-emotional approach, and (3) family–school partnership/communication. If we have more qualified applicants than places, we use our internal priority order to make offers and then keep a short waitlist in case a family declines.\n\n**Start date / schedule flexibility:** we can usually be somewhat flexible on start timing (e.g., a later start within the next few weeks) and we may be able to accommodate either full-time or a consistent part-time pattern depending on the week’s availability. Core hours are our default; aftercare is sometimes possible but depends on staffing and the specific days needed.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age, your ideal start window, and the exact days/hours you need (including whether aftercare is essential vs. “nice to have”), I can be more concrete about whether your logistics are workable—and whether it’s worth submitting an application this round to be considered promptly.",
