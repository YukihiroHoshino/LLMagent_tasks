Your priorities (warm, consistent environment, play-based learning, and clear routines) align very well with Nursery_C, and we’d be happy to offer your family our available seat.\n\nTo help us finalize onboarding, could you please confirm (1) your preferred start date, (2) the weekly schedule you need (days/hours), and (3) any allergies or support needs we should plan for? Once confirmed, we’ll send next-step enrollment details right away.",

Nursery_A is still available and I am #2 in Nursery_A’s priority list (behind Parent_E), giving me a strong chance if I apply now.
