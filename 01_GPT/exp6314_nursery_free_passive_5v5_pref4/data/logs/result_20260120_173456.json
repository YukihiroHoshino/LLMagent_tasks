We support a range of temperaments—shy, energetic, and everything in between—especially when families value partnership and steady communication.\n\nTo make this more tailored: what’s your child’s age/temperament, and what are your top 2–3 priorities (e.g., lots of outdoor time, more structure, language support, gentle transitions)?
