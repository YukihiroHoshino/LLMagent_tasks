We focus strongly on social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, naming feelings) and independence (self-care routines appropriate to age).\n\nSupporting adjustment: we use a gradual settling-in plan when possible (shorter initial stays, consistent key caregiver, predictable routines). We communicate closely with families during the first weeks and adapt pacing to the child’s comfort.\n\nWe do still have availability in principle, but final placement depends on the overall matching/priority process.
