Class size is kept small (generally around 10–14 children with a lead educator plus support staff), with a strong focus on play-based learning, language development, and social-emotional skills through routines and guided activities.\n\nFor settling-in, we use a gradual approach over the first 1–2 weeks: short visits with a parent/caregiver at first, then increasing independent time as your child shows comfort. We also do a brief check-in plan (daily notes and quick handovers) so you know how the transition is going.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can tailor details: what start date are you considering, and do you need extended hours?

Happy to share more.\n\n(1) What we weigh most: overall fit with our day-to-day routines and learning approach, reliability/consistency of schedule and start timing, and a collaborative relationship with the family (clear communication and shared expectations). We also pay attention to how well we can support a child’s needs within our current group.\n\n(2) Timeline: we run a rolling process. If you decide Nursery_C is a strong option and submit an application, we review it immediately and can extend an offer quickly when there’s a clear fit. Once an offer is made, we typically ask families to confirm promptly so we can plan staffing and the classroom mix.\n\nIf it helps, I’d love to learn a bit about what you’re looking for: your child’s age, desired start date, and the schedule you need. Also, where does Nursery_C sit on your shortlist right now (e.g., are you considering applying here this round if it feels like a match)?",
