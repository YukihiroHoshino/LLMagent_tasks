We’re fully flexible on start date, hours, and transition plan.\n\nAre you able to make a final decision this round (offer or release)?

I already submitted a formal application earlier, so I cannot [APPLY] again; I should use [TALK] to make a final, clear acceptance commitment and prompt an offer decision. Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me last, so I likely lose to others if they were still available, but they are matched; with Nursery_C still unmatched, there is a chance they can offer to me now. I will ask for an immediate final decision and reiterate full flexibility and readiness to complete any last requirement today."
