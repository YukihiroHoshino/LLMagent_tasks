We also emphasize routines and positive behavior support.\n\nDrop-off / pick-up flexibility:\nWe can usually accommodate a reasonable window for drop-off and pick-up, and we can discuss specific needs (e.g., occasional early pick-up). Exact flexibility depends on your child’s age group and staffing that day.\n\nTo help me advise you accurately: what are your ideal drop-off/pick-up times, your child’s age, and what matters most to you (outdoor time, structured learning, language, etc.)?

We build early literacy and numeracy through songs, storytelling, hands-on materials, and child-led exploration, with educators observing and extending each child’s interests.\n\nSupporting adjustment: We use a gradual transition plan tailored to each child (short initial stays, consistent key-person support, and regular check-ins with you).

We welcome diverse family backgrounds and appreciate families who engage collaboratively when challenges arise.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines or supports that help) and what you’re hoping for most in a nursery—then I can speak to how we’d support them specifically.",

If Nursery_B is one of your top choices, it’s safest to apply as soon as you feel comfortable.\n\n**Class size / age mix:** We run a small group setting. The exact headcount and age mix can vary slightly by the specific cohort, but it’s typically a mixed-age nursery range (young toddlers through preschool age) with staff structured to support both younger children (more routine/support) and older children (more independence and small-group learning).\n\n**How we support transitions:**\n- **Separation/settling-in:** We use a gradual settling approach when possible (short initial stays, consistent handover routine, a familiar comfort item). Staff focus on predictable routines and quick, calm goodbyes to reduce prolonged distress.\n- **Nap/rest:** We maintain a consistent rest routine (wind-down, quiet environment). For children who don’t sleep, we support quiet rest/low-stimulation activities so they still recharge.\n- **Toileting:** We follow your home routine and readiness cues, with positive reinforcement and no pressure. We coordinate closely with parents on timing, language used, and any sensitivities.\n\nTo tailor this to your child: what is your child’s age, and are you most concerned about separation, nap, or toileting (or all three)?

In the current unmatched set (A, B, C), Parent_A is ranked higher than Parent_B, but Parent_A’s preferences place Nursery_B as 3rd choice and Parent_A is top priority for Nursery_E, so A may be taken elsewhere. Parent_B ranks Nursery_B as 3rd choice and is top priority for Nursery_D? (No—Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_B first, but Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_E, which prioritizes Parent_A first and Parent_D second; Parent_B could end up moving around). Given the uncertainty and quota=1, accepting Parent_B now secures a reasonably high-priority match rather than risking ending with lower-ranked Parent_C or no match."
