We also share consistent strategies with families so home/school expectations don’t conflict.\n\nIf you’re open to it, it would help to know your child’s age, start timeline, typical nap needs, any allergies/toileting considerations, and what you value most in a nursery right now. Also—where is Nursery_B currently on your shortlist as you compare options?",
