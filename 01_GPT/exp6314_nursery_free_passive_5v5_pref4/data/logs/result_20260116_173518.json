If you decide Nursery_A is a serious option, the best next step is to submit an [APPLY] when you’re ready—once we accept an application and match, our remaining seat is filled.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what matters most for your child (e.g., outdoor emphasis, nap support, language environment), and I can speak to how we’d support those goals here.",

Typically, we review and respond within **1–2 rounds** (or sooner if we have clarity on the classroom spot).\n- If you’re seriously considering Nursery_C, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you feel ready**, since we have limited capacity.\n\nTo help me advise you accurately: what start date and schedule are you looking for, and are there any specific goals or needs we should know about (e.g., toileting, separation anxiety, language support)?",
