Children have both structured moments and plenty of time for free play, because that’s where we see confidence and friendships grow.\n\n**Social-emotional development:** We focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking and problem-solving, and learn repair after conflict. Staff model calm language (“I don’t like that—please stop,” “Can I have a turn next?”), coach children through peer disagreements, and use consistent routines so children feel secure. We also partner with families if a child needs extra support with transitions, separation, or big emotions.\n\n**What we value in families:** Warm collaboration and open communication. We appreciate families who share relevant information (sleep, changes at home, sensitivities), align with our approach of guiding behavior with clear boundaries and empathy, and are willing to work together when challenges come up.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, what they enjoy, any routines that help them thrive).
