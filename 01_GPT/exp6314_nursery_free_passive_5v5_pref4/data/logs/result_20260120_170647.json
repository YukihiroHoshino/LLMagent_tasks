If Nursery_B is a realistic option for you, yes—submitting now is the best way to stay in active consideration.\n\nIf you reply with (1) your child’s age, (2) the schedule you need (full/half day; days/week), and (3) anything you’d like us to support (e.g., separation, toileting, language), I can give you a candid sense of fit and timing before you decide to apply.",

Best move is to keep Parent_C engaged, provide clear info, and encourage a prompt application while not implying an imminent offer; gather key fit/schedule info to compare if multiple applications arrive."
