We add **light structure** in small groups for things like listening skills, early phonological awareness, and problem-solving—kept brief and developmentally appropriate.\n- **Outdoor time:** daily (weather permitting), usually a substantial block in the morning and/or afternoon.\n- **Lunch & meals:** communal mealtimes with routines that support independence (self-serving where appropriate) and social skills.\n- **Nap/rest:** after lunch; we support individual needs with a consistent routine and a quiet environment.\n- **Afternoon:** a mix of outdoor play, creative projects, and calm winding-down activities before pickup.\n\n**Our approach (play vs. structure)**\nWe’re firmly **learning-through-play**: children build language, self-regulation, and early academic foundations through guided play and rich environments. We do use structure for routines and short small-group moments, but we avoid long, desk-style instruction at this age.\n\n**Family–school partnership**\nWe value **two-way communication** (quick daily updates plus more in-depth check-ins), consistent routines between home and school when possible, and collaboration around goals (sleep, toileting, separation, peer relationships). Volunteering is welcomed but not expected—what matters most is a shared, supportive approach for your child.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: **what are you hoping your child gains most this year** (e.g., confidence, social skills, language, routine), and **where does Nursery_A sit among your current top choices/timeline** for deciding?
