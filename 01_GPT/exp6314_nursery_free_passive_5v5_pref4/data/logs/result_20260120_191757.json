I believe I’d be a strong fit for your community and I’m ready to commit promptly if accepted. If helpful, I can share any additional details you need about our child and schedule right away. Thank you for considering us.",

Nursery_E is ranked above Nursery_A, but Nursery_E has Parent_C last in its priority list, making acceptance unlikely if others apply. Nursery_A has Parent_C ranked 2nd in its priority list (behind Parent_E), giving me a strong chance if I apply now. Since this is a one-shot exchange this round, applying to Nursery_A is a good compromise to secure a match rather than risk ending with only Nursery_B or unmatched."

We’d be happy to offer you our available spot.\n\nTo finalize, could you please confirm your preferred start date and weekly schedule (days/hours), plus any key routines or transition needs we should plan for (sleep, meals, soothing strategies)? Once we have that, we’ll share next-step enrollment details and set up a brief onboarding call.\n\nWe’re excited about the possibility of welcoming your family.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is 2nd on Nursery_A’s true priority list (very desirable) and has applied with willingness to commit promptly. With quota 1 and no current matches, accepting now secures a high-priority match and avoids risk of losing the spot to a lower-priority parent later."
