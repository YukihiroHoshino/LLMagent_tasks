If applicable, sibling considerations can help, but they’re not the only factor.\n\nOn demand: we do expect competition for our single spot, so a clear, specific application helps—especially around your preferred schedule, start date, and anything you’d want us to know about your child’s temperament/needs.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what start date are you aiming for, what weekly schedule do you need, and any key priorities (language environment, outdoor time, naps/meal routines) that matter most to your family?

Parent_E prefers D then E then C then B then A (A is last), Parent_C prefers D then C then E then A, Parent_D prefers D then B then C then A. Since D and B are likely to attract others, there is a plausible path for me to get A if higher-priority parents land elsewhere. I should signal strong intent to accept immediately if offered, and ask about next steps/waitlist."
