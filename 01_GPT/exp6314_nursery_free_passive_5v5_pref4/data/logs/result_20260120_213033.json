Mornings typically include arrival/choice play, a short community circle (songs, calendar, sharing), then small-group activities (early literacy, math concepts, art/sensory) tailored by age and readiness. We prioritize hands-on learning and outdoor time daily whenever weather allows.\n\nSocial-emotional development: We use consistent classroom routines, visual supports, and explicit coaching for turn-taking, naming feelings, problem-solving, and repairing conflicts. Teachers model language like “I feel… I need…” and guide children through peer interactions. We also communicate proactively with families if we notice patterns (e.g., separation anxiety, friendship dynamics) so we can support together.\n\nExpectations for families: Reliable drop-off/pick-up, keeping us informed on health/schedule changes, and partnering on routines (sleep, toileting, behavior guidance) are the big ones. We welcome family involvement when possible (events/reading days), but we understand schedules vary.\n\nStart times & aftercare: Our standard drop-off window is around 8:30–9:00 with the core day ending mid-afternoon (typically ~15:00). We generally offer extended care options into late afternoon depending on enrollment demand—if aftercare is important for you, tell me your needed hours and we’ll confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nTo make sure I answer what matters most: what age is your child, and are you looking for more structure (school-readiness focus) or more flexibility/play? And do you need aftercare regularly or only occasionally?",

At round 3 only Nursery_A and Nursery_C remain unmatched, suggesting my earlier applications to E and A did not secure a match. Given capacities are 1 each, waiting risks ending unmatched if Nursery_A fills with someone higher in its priority (I am last for A). Nursery_C’s priority ranks me 4th (behind D, E, A), but those parents likely matched elsewhere since only A and C remain. Therefore applying to Nursery_C now is a reasonable compromise to secure a match rather than risk being left without placement."

[ACCEPT]",

With quota 1 and no matches yet, we should consider accepting to secure a match, but we must weigh the chance of getting a higher-priority parent (Parent_D/Parent_E/Parent_A) later. In the current unmatched pool only Parent_B and Parent_C remain; Parent_C is ranked lower (5th). Accepting Parent_B now is better than risking ending unmatched or matching with Parent_C.
