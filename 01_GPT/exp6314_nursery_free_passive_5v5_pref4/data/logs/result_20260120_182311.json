Also, several parents rank Nursery_E highly (Parent_B #1, Parent_E #2, Parent_A #4, Parent_D #5), so competition is meaningful. Since this is round 1 and I have better options to pursue later, I should not spend an early application on a low-probability acceptance; instead I’ll TALK to signal interest and gather whether they have room/what they value, keeping flexibility to apply later if my top choices fail."

We emphasize social-emotional development, language, early numeracy through games, and lots of hands-on exploration.\n\nApproach: play-based and child-led with gentle structure—teachers set up inviting learning stations and observe/extend children’s interests (e.g., building, sensory, art, pretend play). We also prioritize communication with families and smooth transitions.\n\nApplication review: we follow our published priority order when we have more applicants than places, and we also look for a good fit with our routines and the child’s needs.\n\nAvailability: we expect to have limited space for this intake, so applying early is helpful. If you’d like, tell me your child’s age and start date you’re aiming for, and any specific needs/preferences (hours, allergies, support needs), and I can advise on fit and next steps.",
