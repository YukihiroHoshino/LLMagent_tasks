We focus on warm routines, independence (self-help skills), and positive guidance.\n\nKey policies in brief: consistent drop-off/pick-up procedures, clear illness/return-to-school guidelines, and regular parent updates (weekly highlights + quick notes as needed).\n\nTo make sure we’re a good fit, could you share: (1) your child’s age and any prior group-care experience, (2) what you value most (e.g., academics, outdoor time, structure, flexibility), and (3) any schedule needs (start date/hours)?",

We also appreciate families who communicate openly (e.g., about transitions, allergies/sleep routines) so we can keep care consistent between home and school.\n\nDaily routine (high level): arrival and free play, morning circle, small-group activities (literacy/numeracy through play, art/sensory), outdoor time, lunch, rest/quiet time, then afternoon play and pick-up.\n\nEnrollment steps/dates: typically the key steps are (1) family conversation/visit, (2) application submission, and (3) offer/confirmation if a place is available.
