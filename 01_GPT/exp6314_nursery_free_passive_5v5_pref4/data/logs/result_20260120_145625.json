I want to reiterate that I’m very interested in Nursery_E because we’re looking for a warm but structured setting and consistent, two-way communication with families. Could you share (1) whether you expect to fill your single spot immediately upon receiving an application this round, or whether you anticipate waiting across rounds, and (2) what would make a family stand out for you (e.g., schedule reliability, engagement with the community, alignment with routines/values)? If it’s helpful, I can also briefly share our schedule needs and how we’d participate in the nursery community.",

Nursery_E also ranks me last, but if higher-priority families secure other matches (A is already matched; D likely matched; E may prefer A/D/E/B ahead of me), E might still have an open seat later. In this round I should keep Nursery_E warm with a strong fit message but not apply yet, because an early application is likely to be rejected given their priority list; better to gather info and preserve flexibility while I also pursue Nursery_C when possible."

If an application comes in and the fit is clearly strong (schedule/routines align and we’re confident we can support your child well), we *can* confirm quickly—but we may also hold decisions briefly across rounds to compare pending conversations/applications before finalizing.\n\n(2) What makes a family stand out for us:\n- **Schedule reliability & routine alignment** (drop-off/pick-up consistency, comfort with our daily rhythm).\n- **Partnership mindset** (responsive communication, willingness to collaborate on goals and transitions).\n- **Child’s readiness/support needs clarity** (what helps your child thrive; any supports we should plan for).\n- **Values fit** (kindness, respect, consistency, and engagement with the classroom community).\n\nIf you’re willing, please share your schedule needs (ideal hours, any constraints) and a quick snapshot of your child (age, temperament, what structure looks like at home).
