We use observation to tailor activities to each child’s interests and developmental stage.\n\nHours/flexibility: We generally offer standard full-day hours with options for earlier drop-off/later pick-up depending on availability. If you share the hours you need (drop-off/pick-up), I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately:\n1) Your child’s age and preferred start date?\n2) Ideal schedule (full-time vs part-time; earliest drop-off/latest pick-up)?\n3) Any key priorities (outdoor time, language support, allergies, etc.)?\n\nIf Nursery_C becomes a top contender for you, feel free to follow up anytime—happy to continue the conversation.",

Parent_B is applying and can commit to hours/start date, so accept and secure match."
