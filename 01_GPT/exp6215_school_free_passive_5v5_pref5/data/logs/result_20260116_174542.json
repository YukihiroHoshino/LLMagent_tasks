That said, it’s not just about being the most decorated applicant; we’re trying to find the student who is the strongest match for our program and community. A student who clearly aligns with our academic approach and can articulate what they want to build here can be very competitive.\n\nTo help you assess where you’d stand: what are your strongest subjects right now, and what’s one activity/project you’ve stuck with long enough to show real growth or leadership?
