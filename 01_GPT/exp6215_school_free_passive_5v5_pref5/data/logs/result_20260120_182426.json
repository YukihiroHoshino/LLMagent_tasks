That said, for borderline cases we may wait briefly to compare within a small pool. Practically: applying early with a complete file helps you get considered sooner and reduces the risk of competing for the last spot.\n\n2) What makes an applicant stand out most this year:\n- Clear academic direction + evidence: not just “I like STEM/humanities,” but specific courses, projects, competitions, research/reading lists, or self-driven work that shows depth.\n- Consistent effort and growth: upward trajectory, resilience after setbacks, and strong study habits.\n- Community contribution: examples of collaboration, mentoring, leadership, or sustained service where you made a measurable impact.\n- Authentic fit: a compelling reason School_E is the right environment for you (programs you’d use, clubs you’d build/join, how you learn best).\n\nIf you tell me (a) your top 2–3 academic interests and (b) one activity you’re most proud of, I can suggest what to emphasize in your application to School_E—and what would make you especially competitive here.",
