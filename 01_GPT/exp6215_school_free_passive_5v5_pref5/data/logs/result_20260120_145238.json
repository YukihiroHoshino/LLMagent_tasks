Students typically meet with an advisor to map courses each term, and we encourage early check-ins if a class feels challenging.\n\nStudent support: We offer teacher office hours and peer tutoring, plus mentoring/advisory check-ins focused on study habits, goal-setting, and staying on track. If you like a lot of guidance and clear milestones, School_E tends to be a good fit.\n\nClubs & community: We support a range of student-led clubs (academic, arts, service, and interest-based). If you tell me what you’re into, I can point you to the closest matches and how easy it is to start something new.\n\nWhat we value in applicants: We look for students who are (1) consistent in effort, (2) proactive about seeking help and using resources, (3) collaborative—adds positively to classrooms/clubs, and (4) curious—willing to explore and grow.\n\nTo help me advise you: what subjects or activities are you most excited about, and where does School_E currently sit on your list (top choice, top 2–3, or still exploring)?",
