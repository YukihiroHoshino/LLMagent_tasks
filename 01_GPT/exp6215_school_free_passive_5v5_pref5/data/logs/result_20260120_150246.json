We also emphasize project-based learning—students regularly produce work they can present (research posters, performances, engineering builds, publications, etc.), not just test prep.\n\nIn student life, School_E is intentionally collaborative. Students are expected to contribute—sometimes through leadership, but just as often through being the person who organizes a study group, mentors a younger student, or helps sustain a club/team. The community is supportive but high-expectations: people work hard, and it’s normal to ask for help early.\n\nA strong applicant profile for us usually includes:\n- Consistent academic effort over time (not necessarily “perfect,” but upward trajectory and strong habits)\n- Intellectual curiosity (reading beyond class, independent projects, competitions, or deep interest in a subject)\n- Evidence you’ll engage in the community (clubs, service, team commitments, peer support)\n- Clear fit: you can explain what you’d pursue here and why School_E’s structure helps you do it\n\nTo help you assess fit quickly: what are your top 2–3 priorities in a school right now (e.g., strongest academics, STEM/humanities depth, extracurriculars, advising, culture)?
