If you decide School_E is a real contender, submitting an application sooner helps us review you earlier in the remaining rounds. We can move quickly once we have a complete application and a clear sense of fit.\n\nOn early commitment: we’re open to hearing that School_E is a top choice, and demonstrated interest can help at the margin—especially when we’re deciding among similar applicants. We won’t ask for an exclusive commitment before you’re ready, but if you’re seriously considering us, tell us what’s drawing you here and what you’re looking for in a school.\n\nSelection factors (in order of what tends to matter most):\n- Academic readiness and growth (strong fundamentals + trajectory)\n- Consistency and follow-through (attendance, deadlines, sustained effort)\n- Community fit (how you collaborate and contribute)\n- Depth of involvement (commitment/impact in activities over a long list)\n\nTo advise you honestly: where does School_E sit on your current list, and what are you prioritizing most—academic intensity, specific programs, or a certain kind of community/support?",

Given the small market and uncertainty about reaching Student_B with an APPLY in time, but still only round 3 with many rounds left, the optimal move for priority-maximization is to reject now to preserve capacity for Student_B, while encouraging Student_E to consider other options."
