If you tell me your interests, I can point you to the best-fit groups.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what are you prioritizing most right now—rigorous STEM, humanities depth, a particular club/community, or strong advising/structure?

If School_E is a genuine contender for you, an **[APPLY]** is the clearest signal—and we can move quickly once we see that.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you more precisely:\n1) Where does School_E sit right now among your options, and what would need to be true for us to move into your top 1–2?\n2) What’s the single project/activity you’re most proud of—and what *changed* because you were involved?\n\n[TALK]",
