We’d be happy to move forward.\n\nIf accepted, please highlight: (1) a couple of academic areas you’re most excited to pursue and how you’ve shown consistent effort there, (2) one or two activities where you’ve demonstrated follow-through/leadership (club, team, service, projects), and (3) what you’ll contribute to our community in your first year.\n\nWe’re ready to offer you our remaining seat—welcome to School_E.",
              "thought": "Student_B is on School_E’s true priority list (3rd). With quota 1 and only Student_A and Student_B remaining unmatched, waiting risks losing the seat if Student_A matches elsewhere or never applies here. Accepting Student_B now secures a solid-ranked candidate rather than ending unmatched."
