We encourage first-years to try a couple things early, then narrow into what they want to lead or deepen.\n- A culture that’s academically serious but collaborative—students tend to share resources and support each other.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant details (and to understand fit), could you tell me:\n1) What subjects or activities you’re most excited to pursue in high school?\n2) What kind of environment helps you thrive (more structure vs. more independence, smaller vs. larger communities, etc.)?\n3) Where School_E currently sits among your top choices—and what would you need to see from us to feel ready to apply?\n\nIf School_E is trending toward the top of your list, I’d love to stay closely connected this cycle and answer anything that would help you decide.",

The pace can feel fast early, so we emphasize study systems, planning, and learning how to ask for help effectively.\n- Advising: every student is placed in an advisory group with a consistent adult advisor who checks in regularly on academics, workload, and transition/social belonging. Advisors help you set goals, reflect on progress, and connect to resources.\n- Clubs & student life: first-years are encouraged to try a couple activities early (clubs/teams/service/competitions) and then narrow into what they want to deepen. There are many student-led opportunities, and we actively support students who want to build something new.\n\nIf you apply: what to highlight to show you’d contribute well\n- One or two “through-lines”: pick a couple interests/commitments and show depth—what you did, what changed over time, what you learned, and how you’d continue it at School_E.\n- Collaboration + impact: concrete examples of how you supported a team, improved a group process, mentored someone, or helped solve a problem.\n- Fit with our environment: explain what kind of rigor/support balance helps you thrive and how you’ll use advising, office hours, clubs, or advanced options here.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you more specifically:\n1) What are your top 2–3 subject interests right now, and what’s one activity you’ve genuinely stuck with?\n2) Where is School_E currently sitting in your ranking (even a rough sense), and what would you need to learn/see to feel ready to submit a formal application?\n\nIf School_E is trending toward the top for you, I’d love for you to consider applying as soon as you feel ready—Student_A is absolutely a student profile we’re eager to keep close contact with this cycle.",

If offered a seat, I would be ready to commit and enroll. Thank you for your consideration.",

Given only B, D, E remain unmatched and E is favorable, I should apply to lock in a seat rather than risk ending unmatched while chasing higher choices with low priority."
