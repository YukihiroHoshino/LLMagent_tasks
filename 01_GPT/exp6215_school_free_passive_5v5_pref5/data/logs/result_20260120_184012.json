Reliability, initiative, and a respectful collaborative mindset are especially important for us this year.\n\nFrom what you shared—wanting to contribute consistently and be a dependable member of the community—that aligns very strongly with what we value at School_D. If you’re comfortable sharing: what’s an example of a long-term commitment you’ve stuck with (club, team, project, family responsibility), and what role did you play when things got difficult?\n\nAlso, if School_D is among your top options, I’d encourage you to consider submitting an application when you’re ready—our capacity is limited and we want to make sure strong-fit students aren’t left waiting.",

I already applied earlier, so I should not re-apply; I should send a final, very direct TALK message that (i) reaffirms immediate commitment, (ii) asks for a yes/no decision now, and (iii) requests the exact blocking reason if they still won’t accept. Given School_D’s priority list (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C, Student_E, Student_B), they may have been waiting on higher-priority students, but after 28 rounds it’s likely none are available; pressing for finalization is optimal."

It is the only unmatched school and it’s the final round, so there is no benefit to further TALK—if I want any chance to match, I should make a clear, final commitment request. I previously sent an [APPLY] long ago, but since the protocol here asks to choose an action tag each round and [APPLY] is only allowed if I haven't applied yet, I will use [TALK] while explicitly requesting immediate confirmation and stating I will accept instantly. School_D’s priority ranks me 4th (behind D, A, C). However, those students should already be matched elsewhere by now; if none are available, School_D should take me rather than end unmatched. This message should be concise, final, and focused on closing."
