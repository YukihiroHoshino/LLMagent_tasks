We support clubs, student leadership opportunities, and academic teams; we also help students start new clubs when there’s a clear plan and faculty sponsor.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applicants: (1) consistent effort and follow-through, (2) intellectual curiosity (asking good questions, engaging beyond minimum requirements), (3) positive contribution to the community (collaboration, reliability), and (4) readiness to take advantage of support systems.\n\nTo gauge fit: what subjects or activities are you most excited to pursue in high school, and what kind of support environment helps you do your best (more structure vs. more independence)? If you share that, I can be more specific about how School_D would support your goals.",

Advisors help you plan a balanced schedule if you’re doing multiple activities.\n- **Tutoring**: targeted tutoring and teacher office hours; we’re proactive about early support if a course gets challenging.\n- **Clubs/teams**: academic teams (e.g., math/science/quiz-style teams), debate, student leadership, service clubs, and interest-based clubs. If you have an idea, we’re open to **starting new clubs** with a simple plan and faculty sponsor.\n- **Involvement planning**: we encourage “one deep commitment + one exploratory activity,” and we help students rotate exploration without overloading.\n\n**What we value beyond grades**\n- **Initiative** (starting something, improving something, or taking ownership of a project)\n- **Follow-through** (reliability over time—showing you finish what you start)\n- **Collaboration** (how you contribute to a team/community)\n- **Curiosity** (seeking challenge, asking thoughtful questions, learning beyond requirements)\n\nTo help me be specific about fit: **which pathway sounds closest to what you want right now (STEM, humanities, leadership/civics, arts/media), and what 1–2 activities do you most want to stay involved in during high school?** If you tell me that, I can suggest a realistic course + activities plan that matches your goals at School_D.\n\n[TALK]",
