Higher-priority candidates (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C) could still appear later; however Student_D is likely already matched elsewhere (not in remaining list), and waiting risks ending unmatched. Student_E has explicitly stated School_D is a very top choice and is ready to commit, making acceptance a safe way to fill our seat with an acceptable candidate rather than gamble for a higher-ranked one that may not apply. Therefore accept now."

Remaining options include School_D (ranked above School_E) and School_E. Since I’m currently paired with School_E and have only talked so far, it’s worth applying now to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched. School_E’s priority list ranks me 2nd, so I have a strong chance of acceptance if I apply. Even if School_D is preferable, I may not get it depending on competition and priorities, so locking in School_E is a good compromise."
