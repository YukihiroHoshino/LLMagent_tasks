I have not applied to School_C yet (only talked), and School_C ranks me last, so my chance there is low if higher-priority students apply. School_E ranks me 1st in priority, so applying here is very likely to secure a match and avoid ending up with School_D or unmatched. Given only one message this round to School_E, I should apply now to lock in a safe, acceptable option."

We’re pleased to offer you admission to School_E.\n\nWe value the strengths you highlighted—engagement in the learning environment and community contribution—and we believe you’d be an excellent fit here. If you accept, we’ll follow up with next steps and enrollment details right away.\n\nWelcome to School_E.",

Although Student_A ranks School_E fourth, accepting now secures our best possible match. Student_C is also high (#2) but not higher than A, and may not apply. Therefore accept immediately and reinforce commitment."
