If you tell me what you’re looking for—e.g., strongest subjects, areas you want to improve, and what kind of school culture helps you thrive—I can be more specific about how you’d fit here.\n\nWhat are your top priorities in choosing a school this year (academics, clubs/sports, support level, competitiveness, commute, etc.)?",

We also emphasize a collaborative culture where students push each other without a cutthroat vibe.\n- Growth focus: we look for students who reflect on feedback well and show steady improvement—our advising system pairs students with an advisor who tracks goals across academics and activities.\n\nWhat we value most in incoming students:\n1) Academic readiness and intellectual curiosity (especially consistency and willingness to ask questions),\n2) Sustained commitment outside class (depth over a long list),\n3) Fit—being able to explain why our environment and programs match what you want to do.\n\nTo tailor this: what 1–2 subjects are you most excited to dive deeper into, and what activities have you stuck with the longest?

At School_B I am last priority, so acceptance is unlikely if higher-priority students apply. At School_A I am 3rd priority; Student_E and Student_D outrank me and may apply there.
