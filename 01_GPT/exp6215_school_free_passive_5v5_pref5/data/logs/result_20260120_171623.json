We especially like students who commit and grow over time.\n\nTypical first-year experience (strong coursework + guidance):\n- A balanced but rigorous course load with clear expectations and frequent feedback.\n- Regular advisor touchpoints to plan workload, build study systems, and adjust course rigor if needed.\n- Easy on-ramps into clubs/teams so students find “their people” quickly, plus structured support around time management.\n\nTo tailor this to you: (1) what subjects are you most excited to push in next year, and (2) what kind of support helps you most—structured check-ins, tutoring/study groups, or 1:1 teacher time?
