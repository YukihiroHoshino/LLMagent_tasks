We don’t look for a single “type”—we like students who will use our support structures and contribute positively.\n\nAcademic/support environment: \n- Strong teacher access (structured office hours + flexible help sessions) and early check-ins if a student starts slipping.\n- Clear academic planning: goal-setting each term, progress monitoring, and targeted tutoring/skill workshops when needed.\n- Advising focused on both academics and wellbeing, so students have a specific adult point-of-contact.\n\nTo understand fit better: what are you prioritizing most—advanced coursework, extracurricular opportunities, university guidance, learning supports, or school culture? And what subjects or programs are you hoping to pursue?\n\nIf what you’re looking for aligns with what we offer, we’d be very happy to see an application from you soon and continue the conversation with specifics based on your goals.",
