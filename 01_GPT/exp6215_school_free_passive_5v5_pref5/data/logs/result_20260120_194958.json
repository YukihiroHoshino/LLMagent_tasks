Here’s what tends to stand out at School_E, and what student life feels like.\n\n**What stands out in applicants (top factors):**\n1) **Academic readiness + trajectory**: strong fundamentals, consistency, and evidence you can handle rigorous coursework (especially in your strongest subjects).\n2) **Initiative and impact**: leadership isn’t required, but we value students who *start or improve something*—a club role, a project, tutoring, community work, competition prep—where there’s clear effort and results.\n3) **Fit (“why School_E”)**: the best conversations are specific—students can point to 1–2 parts of our community/programs they’d actually use and what they’d contribute.\n\n**Student life (academics, clubs, support):**\n- **Academics**: challenging but structured—teachers expect effort and curiosity, with clear expectations and feedback.\n- **Clubs & activities**: student-driven; it’s common to join 1–2 clubs seriously rather than spreading thin. Starting new initiatives is supported if you can propose a plan and recruit peers.\n- **Support**: advising and teacher office hours are a real part of the culture; students who seek feedback early tend to thrive.\n\nTo tailor this to you: what areas are you most excited about right now (STEM, humanities, arts, debate, athletics, service), and what’s one accomplishment or project you’re proud of? Also, candidly—where does School_E sit among your current options (top, middle, or still exploring)?",
