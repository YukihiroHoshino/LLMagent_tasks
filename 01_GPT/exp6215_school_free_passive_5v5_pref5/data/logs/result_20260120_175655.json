Students who thrive here tend to like structure and are proactive about using support.\n\nTo understand fit: what subjects are you strongest in, and where do you most want support?

Students who like having adults who know them well—and who want opportunities to take initiative (lead a club, start a project, mentor peers)—usually feel at home here.\n\n**Academics vs extracurriculars:** We aim for strong academics without a “sink-or-swim” vibe. Students typically take a rigorous load, but we actively encourage balance: structured advising, regular check-ins, and teachers who coordinate around major deadlines.

With a single seat, we do tend to decide relatively quickly *once we receive an [APPLY]*, because we can’t risk leaving the spot unfilled late in the cycle. That said, we’re not requiring an early “binding” commitment just to keep talking—what matters most is clarity on your timeline and genuine fit.\n\n**What we’d need to seriously consider an application:**\n1) A clear statement that School_E is a realistic choice for you (not just a back-up), and\n2) Your expected decision timeline if accepted (e.g., same round vs needing additional rounds), and\n3) A brief sense of what you’d contribute here (academics/interests + one community/club/service angle).\n\n**If you remain available later:** yes, we can still review later *if the seat is still open*, but we can’t guarantee it will be—if a strong-fit student applies earlier, we may need to finalize.\n\nTo advise you honestly: where does School_E currently sit among your options (top 1/2/3/4/5), and what would need to be true for us to move up your list? If you’re considering applying soon, I’m happy to outline what parts of School_E match your priorities so you can decide quickly.",

Continue TALK and ask for their ranking/timing and fit details."
