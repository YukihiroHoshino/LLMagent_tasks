Best move is to keep School_E warm as a fallback while I pursue A/B/D in other rounds."

We don’t require a single niche, but we look for direction and momentum.\n- **Evidence of initiative**: something you chose to do beyond requirements—projects, competitions, independent study, community work, or improving a club/team. Follow-through matters more than quantity.\n- **Fit with our culture**: students who seek challenge *and* use support well, collaborate, and contribute positively (reliable teammate, constructive leader).\n- **Self-awareness**: you can explain what environment helps you thrive and what you want to build here.\n\n2) **Early applicants vs. waiting for the full pool**\nWe **review as applications come in** and may extend offers once we’re confident about fit—because our seat count is small. We don’t “reward” early timing by itself, but **applying earlier can matter** simply because **capacity can fill** before the end of the cycle.\n\nIf you’re keeping School_E as a serious option, the most helpful next step is: tell me (a) your top 1–2 academic interests, (b) one initiative/project you’re most proud of, and (c) where School_E currently sits among your choices. If it sounds aligned, I can give you honest guidance on whether applying sooner would be advantageous for you.",

Student_B currently ranks School_E last, so conversion is unlikely; however, providing clarity and a soft-encouragement to apply soon may increase chances without risking an early accept. Since the student is only talking, respond with [TALK] and ask for signals of genuine interest and fit."
