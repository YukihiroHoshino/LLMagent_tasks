After learning more, I’m confident School_A would be a great fit for me academically and personally, and it’s one of my top remaining choices. I’m ready to commit and would be excited to contribute to the community from day one. I’d like to formally apply for your available seat. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "School_A is my 3rd choice (after School_B and School_C). Unmatched schools are A, D, E; B and C are presumably already matched, so my top two options are likely gone. I have relatively good priority at School_A (3rd) behind Student_E and Student_D. If either E or D applies to School_A, I could be displaced, so I should secure a match now. Applying to School_A is better than risking ending up with lower-ranked School_E or School_D."

We’d be excited to have you join School_A and contribute from day one. We are happy to offer you our available seat.

Higher-priority students Student_E and Student_D remain unmatched and could still be attainable; however, with quota 1 and uncertainty in random pairings, accepting a solid in-list applicant now secures a good outcome. Rejecting risks ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked in-list student. Therefore accept and lock in Student_A."
