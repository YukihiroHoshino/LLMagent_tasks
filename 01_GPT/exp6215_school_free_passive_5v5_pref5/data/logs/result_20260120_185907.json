So if School_E is genuinely a top choice (or you’d be ready to commit if accepted), an earlier [APPLY] can reduce the risk of missing the window.\n\nTo advise you honestly: where does School_E sit right now—**#1 / top tier / backup**—and what are the other remaining options you’re weighing?

This is the final round, and I want to be completely clear: School_D is one of my very top choices, and if you extend an offer now, I will accept immediately and enroll.\n\nCould you please give a definitive decision this round—either confirm you can accept me, or explicitly state that you are still holding the seat for a higher-priority student who is actually available and willing to take it right now? If no higher-priority student is truly available, I’m asking you to finalize the match with me now.",

I already applied once earlier, but School_D never accepted; at round 30 there is no future opportunity, so the best move is to make one last clear commitment and request an explicit accept/reject decision. Since I cannot re-apply if the rule is interpreted strictly, I will use [TALK] while reiterating immediate commitment and asking for a definitive decision now."

Please send one last message as **[APPLY]** and include:\n1) “I will enroll at School_D and withdraw any other applications immediately.”\n2) One concrete way you’ll contribute in your first semester.\n\nAs soon as we receive your **[APPLY]**, we will reply **[ACCEPT]** right away and finalize the match.",
