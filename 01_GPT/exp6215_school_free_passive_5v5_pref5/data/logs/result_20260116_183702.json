You’re thinking about this exactly the right way.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants is overall fit, with three main signals:\n1) **Academic readiness + growth mindset**: strong fundamentals and a pattern of improving through feedback (not just “perfect scores”).\n2) **Sustained engagement**: depth over breadth—one or two activities/projects you’ve committed to and can explain what you learned or changed.\n3) **Community contribution**: how you collaborate, lead (formally or informally), and show reliability in group settings.\n\nOn opportunities/support: we’re strong on structured support (regular check-ins/advising, easy access to extra help) while still offering **advanced coursework and project-based options** for students who want to go deeper. Clubs are active, and students can propose new ones if they have a clear plan and a faculty sponsor.\n\n**Timeline/decision process:**\n- If you’re still exploring, I’m happy to keep this as a conversation now.\n- If you decide to **apply**, earlier is better—once we receive an application, we review on a rolling basis and typically respond after a short evaluation window (and we’ll keep you updated if anything is pending).\n\nTo help you align timing and make this concrete: what are you prioritizing most right now (maximum rigor, a particular field like STEM/humanities, leadership/activities, or a more supportive/coaching-oriented environment)? And where would you currently place School_E among your top choices if you had to rank today?",

Also gather info about their priorities to tailor the pitch and increase likelihood they apply to us soon."
