We don’t penalize exploration—we just appreciate clarity and communication. If School_E is becoming a top option for you, it helps to know what you’re looking for (academics vs. extracurriculars vs. support/fit) and your decision timeline.\n\nWhat are your top 2–3 priorities in choosing a school, and are you aiming to apply soon or still in early exploration?",

Could you share what your top priorities are when choosing among applicants (e.g., academics vs. activities vs. community fit), and what kinds of students tend to succeed most at School_E? Also, are there any specific programs, tracks, or signature opportunities that you think differentiate School_E from other schools?",

Since School_C is already matched/unavailable this round and I haven’t contacted School_A or School_D yet, I should not commit to School_E yet. Also, School_E’s priority ranks me 4th (behind A, C, B), so an early application risks rejection if higher-priority students apply. Best move: continue talking to keep the option open, signal interest without applying, and gather any info that could help me decide or strengthen a later application if needed."

If you’re leaning toward applying soon, I can also tell you what a strong School_E application typically highlights.",
