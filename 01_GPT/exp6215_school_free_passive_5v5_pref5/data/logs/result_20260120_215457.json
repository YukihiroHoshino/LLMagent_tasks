Students who thrive here tend to enjoy asking “why,” not just “what,” and they’re comfortable iterating on challenging work.\n\nStudent support & advising: Each student is paired with an advisor who checks in regularly on course planning, workload balance, and goals. We also have structured academic support (office hours/tutoring) and intentional transitions support for new students—study systems, time management, and planning for extracurricular commitments.\n\nExtracurriculars: We encourage depth over breadth. Students often take real ownership—leading a team, building a club, organizing events, or pursuing a longer-term project with a faculty mentor. There’s room to explore, but the culture rewards follow-through.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applicants:\n- Consistent academic habits and curiosity (especially evidence you like to learn beyond the minimum)\n- Initiative/ownership (starting, leading, or meaningfully improving something)\n- Contribution to community (collaboration, reliability, mentorship)\n- Resilience and growth over time (trajectory matters)\n\nTo tailor this to you: what are you optimizing for in a high school (academics, specific programs, clubs/sports, culture, commute), and what 1–2 areas are you most excited to develop over the next few years?
