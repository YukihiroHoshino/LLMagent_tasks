I’m very interested in School_E because I’m looking for a supportive, high-expectations environment where I can contribute consistently in and out of class. I value clear academic standards, respectful community culture, and opportunities to take initiative (clubs/projects/peer support). If admitted, I would be excited to commit and make School_E my home. Thank you for considering my application.",
              "thought": "School_E is 4th on my true list (above School_D) and is still unmatched, so it’s a viable fallback if School_A doesn’t work out. Also, School_E ranks me #1 in its priority list, meaning an application is very likely to be accepted and would secure a match now. Since only School_A and School_E remain, applying to School_E now maximizes my chance of being matched (though it may sacrifice the possibility of School_A). Given the risk of ending unmatched if I wait and School_A fills, I will apply to School_E and emphasize fit and commitment."
