Academically, we offer a structured college-prep core with opportunities to go deeper through advanced coursework and project-based learning (students who want rigor can find it, and students who want to build confidence get a clear pathway to do so). Just as important, we pair that rigor with consistent advising and accessible tutoring/teacher office hours so students don’t have to “figure it out alone.”\n\nIn our community, the students who thrive tend to be:\n- Curious and willing to engage (asking questions, trying new clubs/activities)\n- Consistent in effort (even if they’re still developing a specific “specialty”)\n- Collaborative and community-minded (they contribute to a positive classroom and school culture)\n\nTo help you assess fit: what subjects or activities are you most excited to pursue in high school, and do you prefer a more structured environment with clear expectations, or more independence and self-directed pacing? If School_A feels like the right fit after that, I’d encourage you to submit an application this round so we can seriously consider you for our limited seat.",
