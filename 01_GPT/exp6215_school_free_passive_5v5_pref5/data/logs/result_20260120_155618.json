Please send **[APPLY] right now in Round 30** with:\n1) “School_A is my #1 choice and I will enroll if admitted (and withdraw from all other options),” and\n2) 1 sentence on why School_A.\n\nThe moment I receive your **[APPLY]**, I will respond immediately **in Round 30** with **[ACCEPT]**.",
              "thought": "As School_A, my true priority ranks Student_B 4th (still acceptable). It is round 30 (final), quota 1, and Student_B is the only unmatched student. Higher-priority students are not available. To avoid leaving the seat unfilled, I should convert this to a match, but the protocol requires the student to send an [APPLY] before I can [ACCEPT]. Student_B sent [TALK], so I must respond with [TALK] and instruct them to send [APPLY] immediately, promising instant acceptance."
