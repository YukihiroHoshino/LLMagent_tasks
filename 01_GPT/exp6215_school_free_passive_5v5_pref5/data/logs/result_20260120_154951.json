At School_C I’m also ranked last, and multiple students (B, C, D, E) rank School_C highly, so that seat is also unlikely. At School_A, the priority order is E > D > A > B > C, so I’m relatively strong (3rd). However, Student_B ranks School_A #1 and Student_E ranks School_A #3, so there is competition.
