Also, where is School_A currently sitting on your list—top 1–2, top 3, or more exploratory right now?",

Since Student_C is only talking, continue engagement, provide info, and probe their likelihood to apply/rank us, while keeping flexibility for A/E."

If you’d like, share your main academic interests and 1–2 activities you’re most excited to pursue here so we can connect you to the right first-year supports and opportunities.",
