I’ll answer candidly while keeping the process fair:\n\n- I **can’t pre-commit** to an automatic acceptance next round, because we have to evaluate applications as they arrive and we will prioritize candidates who are higher on our priority list if they apply in the same round.\n- That said, **if you apply next round and we do not receive an application from a higher-priority candidate in that same round**, then **yes—you would be a serious, viable option for our seat**, and we would be prepared to move quickly.\n\nOn whether we’re “holding” the seat: we are **not reserving it** for anyone without an application in hand, but we do expect that at least one of the remaining top-priority students **could** apply, so I don’t want to mislead you that your path is guaranteed.\n\nIf you want the most realistic guidance: would you treat School_E as your **#1 and commit immediately if accepted**? If yes, applying next round is the right move, and I’ll review it promptly.\n\n[TALK]",

Student_D is asking for a conditional immediate acceptance next round; we can’t pre-commit, but we can be candid that we will prioritize higher-ranked applicants if they apply in the same round. To keep an option open without promising, encourage Student_D to apply if School_E is their top choice and ask for their commitment level; maintain [TALK] since they did not apply."
