Depth matters more than doing “a little of everything.”\n- Character & community fit: how you collaborate, treat others, handle responsibility, and contribute to a positive culture.\n- Communication in conversation/interview: clarity, reflection, and authenticity—what you care about and why.\n\nWhat strong applicants typically highlight:\n- 2–3 core commitments (activities/classes/projects) with concrete outcomes and what you learned.\n- A moment you faced difficulty and how you responded (feedback, persistence, growth).\n- How you’d plug into School_E specifically (clubs you’d join/launch, academic interests, ways you’d contribute).\n\nSo I can give you the most useful guidance: what are your top priorities in a high school (academics/advanced coursework, clubs/leadership, arts/sports, support/advising, culture), and what’s one activity or project you’ve gone deepest on?
