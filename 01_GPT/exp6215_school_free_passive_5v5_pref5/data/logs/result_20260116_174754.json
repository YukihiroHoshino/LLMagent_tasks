We appreciate your enthusiasm for our academic environment, and we would be excited to have you join our community.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_A. [ACCEPT]\n\nIf you have any questions about next steps (course planning, orientation, or programs you’re most interested in), feel free to share and we’ll help you prepare for a strong start.",
              "thought": "Student_B is on School_A’s true priority list (4th of 5). With quota 1 and no current match, accepting now secures a committed student. However, School_A’s top priorities are Student_E and Student_D, who both rank School_A 3rd and may still be available; Student_D is still unmatched and has already engaged. Rejecting Student_B risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students match elsewhere, but accepting blocks the chance to match with Student_D/E if they later apply. Given Student_B’s first-choice commitment and the uncertainty of receiving an application from Student_D/E within remaining rounds, accept to fill quota with an acceptable ranked student and lock in a stable outcome."

Could you share (1) the top qualities you prioritize most when choosing among applicants, and (2) one or two signature academic/support opportunities that students most often cite as making School_E a great place to grow? If it helps, I’m a student who values a structured environment and strong teacher support while staying involved in activities, and I’d love to know how School_E supports that profile. [TALK]",

Given priorities, School_A ranks me #2 and is likely attainable if still open; I should avoid committing to E unless necessary. I have only talked to E before and not applied. Best move is to keep E warm with continued interest and gather info, while preserving flexibility to pursue School_A if possible."

              "message": "Thanks for the thoughtful follow-up, Student_D—your profile (structured environment + strong teacher support + staying active) aligns well with what we’re built for.\n\n(1) Top qualities we prioritize when choosing among applicants:\n- Academic readiness + habits: strong fundamentals, consistent preparation, and the ability to learn from feedback (not just test performance).\n- Follow-through and responsibility: sustained commitments—whether in academics, clubs, family responsibilities, or service—matter a lot.\n- Community fit: collaborative, respectful discussion, and being the kind of teammate who makes groups better.\n- Growth mindset: upward trajectory, resilience, and willingness to ask for help early.\n\n(2) Signature academic/support opportunities students cite most:\n- Advisor + check-in system (structured support): every student has an assigned advisor who monitors workload and progress, helps with planning, and coordinates support if a class gets challenging. Students who want structure really value this.\n- Feedback-driven instruction (teacher access): frequent formative assessments, revision opportunities (especially in writing/problem sets), and regular office/help sessions. The goal is that “support” is built into the weekly rhythm rather than only available when something goes wrong.\n\nFor an involved student: we actively help students balance activities with academics through planning support, clear expectations, and early intervention if schedules get too heavy.\n\nTo help you decide whether to apply soon: where is School_E on your current list (top choice, top few, or still exploratory)? And what activities are you most excited to continue here (sports, arts, academic clubs, service)?",

With quota 1 and higher-priority students (A, C, B) still unmatched in the market, we should keep Student_D engaged but avoid committing.

School_E is 4th on my true list (above School_D), so it is preferable to being unmatched. I have only talked with School_E before and have not applied yet.

Accepting secures a match rather than risking an empty seat, and does not violate the constraint since Student_D is on my list."
