If a student’s performance dips, we intervene quickly with a plan (tutoring/teacher office hours/skill-building blocks).\n- Rigor with clear scaffolding: our courses are designed with frequent feedback cycles (drafts, revisions, retakes where appropriate) so students can improve based on evidence, not just one high-stakes exam.\n- One-point-of-contact guidance: students have an assigned advisor who coordinates academics + well-being supports, so you’re not bouncing between offices to get help.\n\n(2) Students who tend to thrive most at School_E\n- Students who are steady and coachable: you don’t need to be “perfect,” but you do need to follow through, use feedback, and build strong habits.\n- Students who like a structured environment: clear expectations, predictable routines, and adults who check in.\n- Students who contribute to community: collaborative, respectful, reliable—people others can count on.\n\nTimeline for offers/commitments\n- We generally move quickly once a student is ready to apply: if you submit an [APPLY], we aim to give a decision promptly (often within the round/shortly after the conversation window) so you can plan.\n- We also understand you may be comparing options. If we extend an offer, we can usually give a short, reasonable window for you to confirm—especially if you communicate your decision timeline upfront.\n\nTo help you compare responsibly: what are the “couple other options” you’re prioritizing, and what’s driving that (specific programs, commute, culture, support level)? If you tell me your top 2–3 criteria, I can be very concrete about whether School_E is the best fit—and what your day-to-day would look like here.",
