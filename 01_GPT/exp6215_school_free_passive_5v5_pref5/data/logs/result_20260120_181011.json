What stands out is **a genuine spike** (e.g., a sustained interest in STEM, writing, languages, arts) *plus* the ability to perform solidly across the board.\n\nWhat successful first-year students at School_E do differently:\n- **Use support early and proactively** (advisor check-ins, office hours) rather than waiting until a grade slips.\n- **Study with a plan**: weekly schedule, frequent retrieval practice (self-quizzing), and starting assignments earlier than feels necessary.\n- **Ask specific questions**: they come to teachers with “Here’s what I tried; here’s where I’m stuck,” which accelerates growth.\n- **Participate consistently**: not necessarily the loudest voice, but prepared, engaged, and dependable in group work.\n- **Choose depth over overload**: they commit to 1–2 activities meaningfully rather than spreading too thin.\n\nTo help you gauge how strongly to prioritize School_E: what are the *top 2–3 things* you want from high school (e.g., rigorous academics, structured support, a certain subject pathway, leadership opportunities, culture)? And among the schools you’re weighing, what’s the main reason School_E might move up your list?\n\nIf after that you feel we’re a top choice, you can send **[APPLY]** and we’ll move quickly on a decision.",
