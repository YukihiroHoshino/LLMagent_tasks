              "message": "Hi Student_B—thanks for reaching out. We’re very open to exploratory conversations early on.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants:\n- Strong academic habits and intellectual curiosity (we look for evidence you engage deeply, not just grades).\n- Consistent effort and growth over time.\n- Contribution to community (clubs, teamwork, leadership, service—quality matters more than quantity).\n- Clear fit: why our programs and culture match what you want to pursue.\n\nOn early commitment: we don’t require an “early commitment” just to talk or even to apply. If you do apply, we do appreciate a clear signal of interest, but we won’t pressure you to commit before you’ve compared options.\n\nTo gauge fit on our side, could you share (1) what you’re hoping to get out of high school (academics/extracurriculars/support), and (2) what criteria you’re using to rank schools right now? If you tell me what you’re optimizing for, I can be specific about whether School_E is a strong match for you.",
              "thought": "Student_B is 3rd on School_E’s true priority list (A, C, B, E, D), so worth actively courting but not committing a seat without an application. Student_B ranks School_E last, so likelihood of applying soon is low; use this round to differentiate School_E and encourage an eventual APPLY while keeping flexibility for higher-priority A or C if they approach later."

I have relatively strong priority at School_D (4th), and only Student_D and Student_A outrank me there; Student_D likely targets School_B first, and Student_A also targets School_B first, so competition for School_D may be limited. Applying early can secure a good match before others pivot to School_D if they are rejected elsewhere."

However, there is no guarantee they will apply to us since several rank School_D low; Student_C ranks us 3rd and Student_E ranks us 2nd, making Student_E relatively likely to commit. To maximize expected outcome while avoiding an empty seat, accept Student_E now."

However, Student_A and Student_D also rank School_B first, and Student_B ranks it 2nd, so competition is intense. With capacity 1, delaying could let a higher-priority student secure the seat.

Although Student_E (#1) and Student_B (#2) exist, there is no guarantee they will apply to School_B given their preferences (Student_E ranks School_B last; Student_B ranks School_B second after School_A). With quota 1 and round 1, locking in a high-priority, highly committed applicant is strong. Accept now to secure a good match rather than gamble for a higher-ranked student who may not apply."

Student_B ranks School_C 3rd and likely applies to School_A first; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd but applies to School_B first. That gives me a reasonable chance to secure School_C now before higher-priority students turn to it.
