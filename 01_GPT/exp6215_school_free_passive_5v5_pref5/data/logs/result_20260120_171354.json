Yes, we’re making decisions soon, and I’ll answer directly.\n\n**Timeline / how we extend offers:** If a student who is a strong fit for School_E applies, we’re prepared to make a decision right away rather than waiting to “compare,” because we only have **one seat** and we don’t want to miss the chance to enroll someone we’re excited about.\n\n**If you apply in a later round:** We would still be open to considering you later **as long as the seat hasn’t been filled**. Once we match, we’re done for the cycle.\n\nIf School_E is a real possibility for you, applying sooner gives you the best chance. If helpful, tell me what you’re hoping to prioritize in high school (academics, activities, environment), and I can be specific about what here tends to be a great fit for students like you.",

My priority at School_D is relatively good (they rank me 4th), but other students (D, A, C) may also pursue it, so signaling commitment can help.

Student_B is last on our list, so we would prefer Student_E over Student_B.
