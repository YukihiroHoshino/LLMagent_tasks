If you have a particular academic “spike” (e.g., math, writing/humanities, CS, sciences), it helps when it’s well-supported by coursework and/or independent work.\n\n2) Initiative and ownership: leadership matters, but we weigh “initiative” broadly—starting or improving a club/team, designing a project, pursuing a research/engineering build, organizing service with measurable impact, or sticking with a demanding activity over time.\n\n3) Fit and clarity of purpose: applicants who can articulate why School_A specifically (programs, culture, opportunities) and how they’ll contribute to the community tend to stand out.\n\nOn timing: we have only one seat, and in markets like this it can fill early if a strong-fit student applies and we’re aligned. So if School_A becomes one of your top choices, applying sooner is generally safer than waiting.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: what are the 2–3 programs you’re prioritizing right now, and what’s the main criterion driving that ranking (academics, specific clubs, environment, etc.)?

Just as important: using feedback well and being proactive about help.\n2) **Depth over breadth in activities**: sustained commitment to 1–2 areas (club, sport, project, competition, service) where you’ve grown responsibility or impact.\n3) **Community fit**: reliable, collaborative classmates—students who contribute to a positive culture, follow through, and elevate group work.\n\n**On committing our seat / timing:**\nWe have **one seat**, so yes—we may commit it **quickly** once we see a clear match and the student signals genuine intent. If a higher-priority student applies and is a strong fit, we would likely move fast. That said, **Student_C is absolutely in the group we take seriously**, and if School_D is truly one of your top choices, applying sooner is the best way to be considered before the seat fills.\n\nTo advise you honestly: **where does School_D sit for you right now (top 1 / top 2 / top 3+) and what are the other schools you’re weighing most closely?** If you tell me that, I can give you a straight recommendation on whether you should submit an **[APPLY]** this round.",

My quota is 1 and currently unfilled; Student_D (my top) is already matched elsewhere, leaving Student_A and Student_C as main realistic targets. Student_C also ranks School_D 3rd, so they may apply if I create urgency and clear fit. I should answer priorities, be transparent that I may commit quickly if a higher-priority student applies, and encourage Student_C to apply now if School_D is truly top-tier for them, while gathering their likelihood of choosing School_D."
