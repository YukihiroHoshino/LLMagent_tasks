At School_E, we’re known for a strong academic core with structured support: teachers run regular help sessions, we use frequent progress check-ins, and we pair students with an advisor who helps with goal-setting and course planning.\n\nProgram strengths: we emphasize project-based learning in core subjects (students build portfolios over the year), strong writing/communication across disciplines, and opportunities for advanced coursework for students who want extra challenge.\n\nStudent support: beyond advising, we offer tutoring blocks, peer study groups, and early intervention if a student’s performance dips—our goal is that students never “fall through the cracks.”\n\nExtracurriculars: a mix of academic clubs (STEM, debate, literature), service/leadership opportunities, and arts/sports options. Many students take on leadership roles by 10th–11th grade.\n\nWhat we look for most in applicants: consistent effort, curiosity, and a willingness to participate in the community (clubs, teamwork, leadership, or service). Grades matter, but we especially value students who show growth and initiative.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant details—what are your top priorities in a school (e.g., advanced academics, STEM, arts, sports, mentoring/support), and what kind of environment helps you thrive?",

Student_B currently ranks School_E last, so we must improve perceived fit and differentiate programs/support/extracurriculars, and ask what B values to tailor.
