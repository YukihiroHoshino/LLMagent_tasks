We look for sustained commitments (a team, a club, an art form, community work) where you’ve grown responsibility over time.\n\n**Student culture**\n- Collaborative and discussion-driven—students who contribute thoughtfully and help others learn tend to thrive here.\n- “Follow-through” is a big cultural value: starting things is great, finishing them (or improving them) is even better.\n\n**Signature programs / strengths**\n- **Project-based courses** in several subjects where students present, defend ideas, and build real artifacts (papers, prototypes, performances, etc.).\n- **Advisory + support blocks**: structured check-ins plus targeted help sessions so students can stretch academically without feeling lost.\n- **Student-led initiatives**: we actively support students who want to launch a club, event series, peer tutoring, or community partnership.\n\n**What stands out for admitted students**\n- Clear evidence of **intellectual curiosity** (you go beyond what’s assigned, you ask good questions, you connect ideas).\n- **Consistency and resilience** (your record shows you stick with challenging work and improve).\n- **Positive community impact** (mentoring, teamwork, leadership that’s service-oriented—not just titles).\n\nTo make this concrete for you: what are your top 2–3 priorities in a school (e.g., advanced coursework, arts/athletics, clubs, support, campus culture)?

Students can drop in, but we also *proactively* invite students based on early quiz/assignment signals.\n- **Small-group skill sessions** (targeted, 4–8 students) for specific topics—e.g., algebra foundations, reading annotation, writing structure.\n- **Structured study groups / peer support:** we form short-cycle study groups around common needs (and we teach students how to run them—agenda, error-log review, practice sets).\n- **Advisory check-ins:** each student sets a simple weekly plan; advisors monitor workload, missing work, and test prep habits early so gaps don’t snowball.\n\n**Where we most want incoming students to contribute this year:**\n- **STEM (especially “structured problem-solving” culture):** students who like steady practice, explaining solutions, or helping peers build fundamentals.\n- **Humanities (writing + discussion):** students who will show up prepared, contribute thoughtfully, and help create a respectful discussion culture.\n- **Student leadership / community reliability:** we value students who can be counted on—help run a club, organize peer tutoring, support events, or serve as a consistent team member.\n\nFrom what you said—**strong structure + collaborative culture**—you sound aligned with how we operate.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you honestly (and so we don’t mis-time things with our single seat):\n1) **Where is School_D on your list right now—top 2, middle, or lower?**\n2) If you applied and we accepted, **would you be ready to commit**, or are you still waiting on another school’s decision?\n\nIf you tell me that, I can be very direct about next steps and what role (STEM/humanities/leadership) would be the best “immediate impact” match for you here.",
