This is a big part of our academic identity.\n- STEM + Humanities pathways (flexible, not rigid): students can go deeper in advanced math/science OR advanced writing/social science, and we like students who can connect ideas across areas.\n- Leadership-through-service and student-led clubs: we put real responsibility in students’ hands—organizing events, peer tutoring, mentoring, and project-based clubs.\n\nIf you share 2 things, I can tell you very concretely how you’d “plug in” here and what you might highlight if you decide to apply:\n1) What subjects/projects have you enjoyed most (and why)?\n2) What’s one extracurricular you’ve stayed with (or want to go deep on) and what role you’d like to play in it?\n\n[TALK]",
