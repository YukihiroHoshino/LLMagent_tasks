At this stage we’re being selective and prioritizing applicants who show a very clear, specific fit with School_D and who seem ready to contribute right away. I can’t promise timing or outcome from a chat alone, but a strong, well-aligned application can still be very compelling.\n\n2) **Who we’re hoping to add to this year’s cohort:** We’re especially looking for students who bring one or more of the following:\n- **Academic readiness + momentum**: a solid trajectory (especially in math/science and/or writing-intensive work) and the habits to keep up with a fast pace.\n- **Reliable contributors**: consistent follow-through—students who show up, collaborate well, and elevate group work.\n- **Initiative/leadership with substance**: not just titles, but evidence you’ve improved something, mentored others, organized an event, led a project, or built community.\n- **A clear “School_D plan”**: specific courses/paths you want to pursue here and concrete ways you’d plug into clubs, peer mentoring, events, service, etc.\n\nIf you’re willing, share two quick items and I’ll tell you candidly where I see your strongest fit at School_D:\n1) Your top 2 academic interests (e.g., CS, bio, engineering, debate, literature, econ, etc.)\n2) One activity where you’ve shown consistency or leadership (in or out of school)\n\nAnd one practical question: **is School_D a top choice for you, or one of several?** That helps us advise you on whether it makes sense to submit an application now versus keep exploring.",

Remaining unmatched students are A, B, E. From School_D’s perspective, higher priorities are A and E (and D/C already unavailable/matched elsewhere). We should keep flexibility for A/E while maintaining a positive channel with B in case A/E do not materialize. Since Student_B is only talking, respond with [TALK], answer competition question carefully without promising, and ask for their interests plus how highly they rank School_D; also invite them to apply if genuinely interested but avoid any guarantee."
