That said, we’re absolutely still open to a strong application from you, and we do take “fit + evidence” seriously rather than just moving first-come.\n\nOn what matters most when we decide among applicants, the biggest signals tend to be:\n1) Academics (direction + rigor): a clear academic interest and proof you’ve pursued it (advanced classes, sustained independent work, competitions/projects, writing/portfolio—anything with concrete output).\n2) Depth/impact in 1–2 activities: longevity plus measurable contribution (leadership, mentoring, results, initiative), not a long list.\n3) Fit/communication (including interview): specificity about why School_E and how you’ll use our program; thoughtful, grounded self-awareness beats “perfect answers.”\n\nIf you’re considering applying soon, two quick questions so I can advise you more precisely:\n- Where is School_E in your current top choices (roughly #1, #2, etc.)?\n- What’s one academic area you’d anchor your application around, and what’s the strongest piece of evidence you can point to (a project, award, paper, portfolio, etc.)?\n\nIf you share that, I can tell you what would most strengthen your case in the next rounds and how to present it most effectively.",
