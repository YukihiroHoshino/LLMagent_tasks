I’m top-2 in School_D’s priority (behind Student_D), so I have a strong chance if I apply. Waiting risks losing School_D if Student_D applies, and School_E is likely harder for me (I’m top at School_E, but other students may prefer it and could still be unmatched elsewhere). To secure a match rather than risk being left with nothing, I should apply now to School_D with a clear fit statement."
