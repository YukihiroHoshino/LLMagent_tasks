I’m happy to be transparent about what we prioritize.\n\nWhat we weigh most when selecting among applicants:\n- Academics/readiness: strong fundamentals and evidence you can handle a steady workload (consistent performance matters more than a single peak).\n- Follow-through and initiative: sustained involvement—clubs, projects, family responsibilities, work, service—where you’ve shown reliability and growth.\n- Character and community fit: how you treat others, how you respond to feedback, and whether you’ll contribute positively to a collaborative environment.\n- Communication/interview (if applicable): we look for authenticity and reflection—what you’re curious about, how you learn, and what support you use to improve.\n\nStudents who thrive at School_E tend to be:\n- Curious and willing to ask for help early (we have lots of support, but students do best when they use it).\n- Comfortable with structure and steady expectations.\n- Motivated by improvement—students who iterate, revise, and keep going after setbacks.\n\nTo help you judge fit: what areas are you most excited to pursue (STEM, humanities, arts, leadership/service), and do you prefer more structure and frequent feedback or more independence? If you tell me what you’re looking for, I can point you to specific programs/clubs and supports that match your goals—and if School_E is near the top of your list, I’d genuinely encourage you to apply when you’re ready.",
              "thought": "Student_E is on our true priority list but ranked 4th (behind A, C, B). We still have full quota and no current match, and only A, C, E remain unmatched. Since A and C rank School_E 4th and may not apply soon, we should keep Student_E engaged and try to elicit an application while not committing yet. Provide clear selection criteria and “fit” signals, ask targeted questions, and invite them to apply if School_E is a top choice."

I also have relatively high priority at School_A (3rd), behind Student_E and Student_D, so an early application could lock in a match if they are still available. Given the one-seat quota and that I haven’t applied to School_A yet, applying now maximizes my chance to secure a high-ranked placement."

If you can, please reply with a brief confirmation that School_A is your final choice and one or two areas you’re most eager to get involved in (academic interests and/or an activity), so we can start thinking about how to support your transition.",
              "thought": "Student_A is on School_A’s true priority list (ranked 3rd). With quota 1 and only Students A, C, E unmatched, School_A’s top choice is Student_E (rank 1) who has indicated School_A is one of their top choices but has not applied yet; Student_E’s first choice is School_C, so they may apply elsewhere. Student_C ranks School_A last and is lowest priority for School_A, so unlikely to be a good match. Accepting Student_A now secures a solid, high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for Student_E. Therefore, accept Student_A and reinforce commitment."
