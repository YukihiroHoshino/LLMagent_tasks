We value students who combine strong academic readiness with consistent follow-through and positive community contribution, and what you’ve shared aligns well with what tends to thrive at School_E.\n\nWe’re pleased to offer you admission to School_E. If you’re ready to commit and enroll as you indicated, the next step is to confirm your enrollment promptly per the instructions you’ll receive.\n\nTo help us support your transition, feel free to reply with: (1) the subjects you most want to push yourself in next year, and (2) one way you’d like to contribute in your first semester (club, study group, service, mentoring, etc.).",
              "thought": "Student_A is #1 on School_E’s true priority list, and we have 1 seat with only Student_A and Student_D unmatched. Accepting Student_A secures our top choice immediately; they also signal readiness to commit, reducing risk of losing them to another school. Therefore we should accept and reinforce fit/next steps."
