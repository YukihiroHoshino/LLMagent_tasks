We don’t “hold” the seat indefinitely, so if School_E is a realistic option for you, applying this round is the safest way to stay in contention.\n\nTo advise you honestly: where does School_E sit for you right now—**top 2, top 3, or lower**—and if we were to move quickly, would you be prepared to commit to School_E if accepted?",

Student_B is transparent that we are not their top choice, so we should encourage an application now while keeping standards clear and signaling that the seat could fill soon, without overcommitting. Since they sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK] and ask for their ranking/likelihood to apply this round to gauge commitment."
