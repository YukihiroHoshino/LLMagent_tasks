We can move quickly when a student is confident and the fit is clear, but we’re also willing to have a couple conversations if you’re still comparing options.

Accepting E now fills my only seat and could block a later higher-priority applicant, but waiting risks ending unmatched if B/D never apply or are taken by other schools.
