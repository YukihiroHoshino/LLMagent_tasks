Students who do best here tend to be self-motivated, but they also value mentorship and steady progress rather than a purely competitive atmosphere.\n\nTo help me advise you honestly: what are the top 2–3 things you’re prioritizing in a school (e.g., advanced classes, club offerings, support level, campus culture, commute)? And which schools are you currently leaning toward most? If you tell me what you’re looking for, I can be specific about whether School_D matches and what opportunities you’d have here.",
