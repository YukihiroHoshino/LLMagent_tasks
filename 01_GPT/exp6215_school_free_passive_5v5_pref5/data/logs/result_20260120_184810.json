At School_D, we value three things most in applicants: (1) consistent academic effort and curiosity (not just peak scores), (2) reliability and follow-through in commitments (attendance, deadlines, teamwork), and (3) positive contribution to community—students who help others learn and who take initiative.\n\nA successful first-year at School_D typically:\n- builds strong study routines quickly (steady weekly habits over last-minute cramming),\n- participates in at least one club/team or project to connect with peers,\n- seeks support early (office hours/tutoring) and communicates proactively.\n\nOn timing: we can make early commitments when a student is confident School_D is a top choice and submits an application; otherwise we also make later decisions as the market develops. If School_D is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel ready—Student_A is someone we consider a strong fit here.\n\nWhat matters most to you in a school (academics, activities, support, culture), and what are you comparing us against?",

Since Student_A is only TALKing, we cannot accept yet; we should provide a clear timeline and encourage an immediate APPLY, while being honest that we may not be able to hold the seat long if another high-priority applicant appears (though unlikely given remaining pool)."

I value your focus on what makes a successful first-year student, and I’m confident I can contribute from day one through consistent work habits and positive collaboration. I’d like to formally apply for your open seat, and if accepted I will confirm immediately.\n\n[APPLY]",

School_D is on my true preference list (though last), so applying is allowed and is the best move given no higher-ranked options remain available. I also have relatively strong priority at School_D (2nd after Student_D), and Student_D is likely already matched elsewhere, so my acceptance chances should be high. I have only talked so far and have not applied yet, so I should apply immediately while reaffirming fit and readiness to commit."
