We also run targeted skill workshops (writing, problem sets, test strategy, study planning).\n2) Advisor system (core of School_E): every student has an advisor who meets regularly for goal-setting, progress checks, and course planning.

If something slips, the advisor coordinates a specific plan (teacher check-ins + tutoring schedule + study system) and follows up to make sure it actually happens.\n- Built-in office hours/tutoring (second most used): structured weekly times that students routinely attend—especially before assessments—plus short skill clinics (writing structure, problem-set approach, test corrections, time management). The key is that it’s normalized and scheduled, so students use it early rather than waiting until they’re behind.\n\n(2) One concrete program/opportunity students feel is uniquely strong at School_E:\n- Our “Mentored Project Pathway”: students can join a faculty-mentored project (or propose one) that runs over a term—examples include research/write-ups, debate/competition prep, coding/data projects, or community-impact initiatives. Students produce a real deliverable (presentation, portfolio piece, competition entry), and the mentor support is structured with milestones and feedback. Students often say this is where they feel both challenged and genuinely guided.\n\nIf what you want is rigorous classes + a safety net that’s organized and proactive, School_E is built for that. To help you decide today: what are the other option(s) you’re weighing, and what’s the single biggest factor that will determine where you commit?
