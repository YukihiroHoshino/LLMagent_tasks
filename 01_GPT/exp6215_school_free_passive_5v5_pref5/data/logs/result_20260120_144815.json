Our advisory/mentoring structure is designed so you have a consistent adult who checks in on workload, goals, and wellbeing.\n- **Extracurriculars:** Clubs are student-led with strong faculty sponsorship—so if you’re motivated, you can both join established teams and also start something new. We see a lot of cross-participation (students doing something academic plus something creative/athletic).\n- **Culture:** Collaborative and growth-oriented. Students who do best here tend to be curious, willing to ask for help early, and interested in contributing to the community rather than competing for everything.\n\n**How we support students who want challenge + balance**\n- Thoughtful course planning (including honors/advanced options when appropriate) with regular check-ins so you don’t overload.\n- Clear expectations and scaffolding early in tougher courses so students build strong habits before the pace ramps up.\n- Encouragement to keep at least one “recharge” activity (arts/athletics/service) so the week isn’t purely academic.\n\nA couple questions to tailor this to you:\n1) Which subjects do you most want to push yourself in next year?\n2) Outside class, what activities do you want to keep doing (or try) so you stay balanced?\n3) Do you prefer more structure and guidance, or more independence with support available when you ask?\n\nIf you share a bit about what you’re looking for, I can point you to specific programs and what a typical week might look like for a student like you.",
