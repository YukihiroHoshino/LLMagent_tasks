With quota 1 and remaining unmatched students A, D, E, the only student ranked above D is E, but E has School_C and School_D ahead of School_A and has not applied yet. Accepting D now secures an excellent outcome and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if E goes elsewhere. Student_A was previously rejected and is ranked below D. Therefore, accept Student_D."

              "message": "Thanks for following up, Student_E—happy to share specifics.\n\n**What our most successful first-year students typically do**\n- **Academics:** They build steady routines early (planner/calendar use, starting assignments before the last day), attend office hours proactively (even when they’re doing “fine”), and aim for **consistent progress** rather than perfection. They also participate in class—asking questions and contributing to discussion.\n- **Involvement:** They usually commit to **1–2 meaningful activities** in the first term (club, team, arts, service, project group) and show reliability—showing up, taking on a role, and following through. Many also try one “stretch” opportunity (a competition, performance, research/project, or leadership task) by midyear.\n\n**Best-fit applicant profile for School_E’s community**\nWe’re the best match for students who are:\n- **Curious and reflective** (can explain what they want to explore and why),\n- **Consistent and dependable** (follow-through, good habits, receptive to feedback), and\n- **Collaborative** (adds to the community—respectful, contributes, helps peers).\nStudents who thrive here generally like a **supportive-but-serious** environment: high expectations with structure and guidance.\n\n**Advising/support that students value most**\n- **Assigned advisor** with regular check-ins, especially during the first term (organization, workload balance, goal-setting).\n- **Teacher office hours/extra help** built into the culture—students are encouraged to use it early.\n- **Academic monitoring + quick intervention:** if a student starts slipping, we coordinate advisor/teacher support quickly rather than waiting for end-of-term surprises.\n\n**Signature programs/opportunities (the ones students talk about most)**\n- **Discussion-based core classes** with emphasis on clear writing, reasoning, and presentation.\n- **Student-led clubs and project teams** where initiative is rewarded (improving an existing club counts as much as founding one).\n- **Capstone-style projects** (students value having a tangible outcome—presentation, product, or community impact).\n\nTo help me advise you well: **where does School_E currently sit on your list (roughly), and what would be your likely next step—are you considering applying to us soon, or still primarily exploring?** Also, what’s one area you’d most want to plug into in year one (STEM/project work, humanities/debate, arts, service, athletics, etc.)?",

Provide concrete first-year success markers, signature programs, and support details, and ask for their ranking/likelihood of applying soon to gauge seriousness."
