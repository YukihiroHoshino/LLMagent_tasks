The most effective ways are:\n- **Demonstrated fit**: connect your interests to concrete programs/communities at School_E and explain what you’d do here (not generic enthusiasm).\n- **A crisp, evidence-based story**: 1–2 examples with measurable outcomes or clear responsibility (what you did, why it mattered, what changed).\n- **Strong, consistent communication**: timely responses and a clear statement of where School_E sits on your list.\n\nSo I can advise you accurately: **where does School_E currently rank for you (roughly #1–#5)?** And what are your **top 1–2 long-term activities**, plus your most “ownership/leadership” moment in each?",

We still expect to hear from and evaluate some applicants who are very high on our priority list, so I can’t promise we’ll have an opening later. That said, we’re **not closed**, and if the seat is still available in a later round, a clear, evidence-based picture of your fit would make your application viable for consideration.\n\nIf you want me to give you the most realistic read, please share (briefly):\n1) **Academics**: your current grades/level in core subjects (and any upward trend).\n2) **1–2 long-term activities**: your role, what you personally owned, and any outcomes/impact.\n3) **Interest/fit**: where School_E ranks for you right now (#1–#5), and 1–2 specific programs/communities here you’d plug into and what you’d do.\n\nWith those, I can tell you candidly whether it makes sense to apply in a later round and what to emphasize.\n\n[TALK]",
