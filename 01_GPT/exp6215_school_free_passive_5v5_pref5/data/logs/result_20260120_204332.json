I will review promptly—but I want to be transparent that if a higher-priority student applies for the same seat, that will strongly affect the outcome.\n\nTo guide timing: where is School_E on your list right now (roughly), and are you prepared to apply to us as your top option this round if you don’t secure your earlier choices?",
