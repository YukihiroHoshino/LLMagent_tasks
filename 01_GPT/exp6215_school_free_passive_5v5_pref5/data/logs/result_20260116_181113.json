We’re glad you’re seriously considering School_E.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants:\n- Consistent academic effort and curiosity (we like students who ask strong questions and follow through).\n- Growth mindset and resilience—students who respond well to feedback and keep improving.\n- Contribution to community: collaboration, reliability, and a willingness to support peers.\n- Clear interests (academic, extracurricular, or service) and evidence you can pursue them steadily.\n\nStudents who thrive at School_E tend to be self-directed, comfortable taking on challenging work, and proactive about seeking help or enrichment when needed. They also tend to get involved—clubs, projects, leadership, or community initiatives.\n\nFrom my perspective, a “strong match” is a student who can explain (1) what they want to explore or build over the next few years and (2) how they’d contribute to the School_E community while doing it.\n\nTo help you decide, what are your top 2–3 priorities in choosing a school (e.g., academics, clubs, culture, support, competitiveness)? And what are you hoping to pursue or develop in high school? If you share that, I can be more specific about how School_E fits—and what would make your application stand out here.",
