We also value evidence of follow-through—whether that’s sustained involvement in an activity, leadership, or meaningful projects.\n\nOn timing: we do review applications as they come in, but because we have limited seats, we may wait to compare across rounds before making a final commitment. That said, if a student is a strong fit and clearly enthusiastic about School_A, we do take that seriously when considering whether to extend an offer.\n\nStudents who thrive most here tend to be self-motivated, comfortable asking questions, and engaged both in and out of class—students who want a rigorous environment and also want to be part of a supportive community.\n\nIf School_A is a place you’re strongly considering, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready and share what you’re most excited to contribute and explore here.\n",
