I’m very interested in School_E because I’m looking for a community where I can contribute consistently and grow academically, and I’m ready to commit fully if admitted. I’d be grateful for your consideration and would be excited to enroll at School_E if offered a place.",
              "thought": "School_E is 4th on my true list, but still acceptable. Remaining unmatched schools are A, B, E. B is my top choice but I am last in School_B’s priority, so applying there likely fails if others apply. School_A ranks me 3rd, but Student_E and Student_D outrank me and may target A. School_E ranks me 1st, so applying to E should secure a match and avoid ending up with my last choice (D) or unmatched. Since I have not contacted School_E before, I should apply now to lock in a safe, acceptable placement."

Your emphasis on consistent contribution, academic growth, and full commitment is exactly the kind of mindset that thrives at School_E. We’d be excited to have you join our community, and we’re pleased to offer you a place.\n\nIf you accept, we’ll follow up with next steps and ways to get connected early (advising, clubs, and community events). Welcome to School_E!",

Student_A’s stated commitment and fit language aligns with School_E’s values. No reason to delay given risk of losing them to other schools in later rounds."
