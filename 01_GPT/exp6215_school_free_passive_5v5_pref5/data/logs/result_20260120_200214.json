We’re making decisions on a rolling basis, and with a single seat we generally don’t wait “just to wait” once we see a strong, clearly aligned application. If a candidate is a clear fit and applies, we’re prepared to move quickly.\n\nWhat we prioritize most is: (1) consistent academic readiness, (2) evidence you’ll contribute to our community (initiative, teamwork/leadership/service), and (3) a specific, concrete “why School_D” that connects your interests to what we offer.\n\nIf School_D is a serious contender for you, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel ready—earlier is better given the limited seat. If you share your top 2–3 academic strengths and 1–2 activities you’re most invested in (and what you’re comparing among the remaining options), I can tell you exactly how to frame your fit with School_D and what parts of our program you should highlight.",

Provide clear timeline: rolling, likely to accept strong fit upon application. Gather info to personalize pitch and move them toward APPLY next round."
