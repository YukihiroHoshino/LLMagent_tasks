Happy to share more about School_E and what helps an application stand out.\n\n**Academic focus & programs:** We’re a strong all-around academic school with an emphasis on (1) rigorous reading/writing across subjects, (2) solid math progression, and (3) discussion- and project-based learning where students present and revise work. Many students plug into academic teams (e.g., debate, math/logic, science research style projects) and writing-intensive clubs/publications.\n\n**Student support:** Students have an assigned advisor who checks in on workload, goals, and adjustment. We also offer structured extra-help/tutoring times (teacher office hours and peer tutoring) and encourage early support-seeking—students who use these resources tend to do very well.\n\n**What makes us more likely to accept (fit/strengths):** We respond best to applicants who show:\n- **Strong fundamentals** (especially writing and math)\n- **Consistency and follow-through** (sustained effort, improvement over time)\n- **Community contribution** (reliable teammate, leadership, mentoring, collaboration)\n- **A specific fit plan** (what you’d actually do here—clubs/competitions/courses—and why)\n\n**Timing guidance (in this simulation):** If School_E is truly one of your top remaining options, applying when you’re ready can help—especially if you can clearly articulate the fit points above. That said, we’re being careful with our single seat and want to be confident about fit before making a commitment.\n\nTo advise you concretely: what are **1–2 academic areas** you most want to push further next year, and **one sustained commitment** (club/team/project/service) you’d bring to School_E? Also, do you tend to thrive more in **fast-paced**, **discussion-heavy**, or **project-heavy** classes?",

Students who thrive here are proactive about asking for help early and then turning that support into progress.\n\nFor students who want to grow academically while staying very involved, our strongest supports are:\n- Built-in advising check-ins (goal setting, course planning, workload balance).\n- Teacher office hours + structured review/tutoring options when a unit gets difficult.\n- Flexible pathways to stay active: many clubs run project/team structures where you can scale involvement up/down during peak academic weeks without dropping out entirely.\n\nTo help you decide whether to apply this round vs. next: where does School_A sit right now among your remaining choices (e.g., top 1–2 vs. still behind another school), and what 1–2 activities are non-negotiable for you in high school?",
