Since I have top priority at Schools A and B, I have strong fallback options later; therefore it is worth applying to School_D now to try to secure my second-best outcome."

At School_B, I am ranked 2nd (behind Student_E), so an early application may secure a seat unless Student_E applies.

My best shot at my 1st choice School_B is weak because School_B ranks me 4th and Student_E/B/C are ahead and likely to apply.

However, Student_D ranks School_C as their 2nd choice after School_B, so there is a meaningful risk they are also applying to School_B, which may accept them depending on School_B’s priorities and other applicants. Given quota=1 and early round, holding out for Student_B or Student_C could yield a higher-priority match, but there is uncertainty about whether those students will apply to School_C soon (Student_B ranks School_C 3rd; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd). To avoid losing a strong candidate and ending unmatched, accept Student_D now."
