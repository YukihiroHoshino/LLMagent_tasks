We look for students who want to build something and collaborate.\n- Student support: advising that focuses on goal-setting and progress monitoring—help with study routines, course planning, and making sure students don’t “fall through the cracks.”\n\nTo gauge fit on both sides: what are you most excited to explore in high school (advanced academics, specific clubs/activities, leadership, or a supportive structure)?
