I have very strong priority at School_A (ranked 1st) and decent priority at School_E (ranked 4th). Because School_A is still unmatched, I should avoid committing to School_E now; instead, keep School_E warm while I try for higher-ranked School_D or School_A. I will [TALK] to gather whether they expect to fill immediately and signal interest without applying yet."

We’re not making a blanket “early acceptance” right this moment, but we *can* move quickly once we see a strong, clearly committed applicant. With only one seat, it may fill soon if we receive an application from a student who is ready to enroll if accepted.\n\nWhat makes an applicant stand out for us *right now*:\n1) Clear evidence of sustained academic effort and curiosity (specific examples—projects, favorite problems/books, independent learning).\n2) Initiative and follow-through (starting/leading something, or taking ownership in a club/team/service).\n3) Community citizenship (how you collaborate, support peers, and contribute).\n\nTo help you time your application appropriately, two quick questions:\n- Where is School_E on your current list (e.g., top choice / top 2 / considering), and if we offered, would you be ready to commit?\n- What are 1–2 concrete highlights that best represent your initiative and curiosity?\n\nIf you tell me you’re prepared to apply this round and School_E is a top choice, I’ll respond quickly and let you know the most realistic path to an offer.",

Since Student_E is actively engaged and asking about timing, we should keep them warm, signal that we may move quickly for a committed applicant, and ask for commitment/fit indicators before inviting an application. Cannot accept because they have not applied; we should use TALK to elicit whether we’re top choice and whether they can commit if accepted."
