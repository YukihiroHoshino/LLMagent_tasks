However, Student_D (our top choice) ranks School_B as their 2nd choice and may apply later; Student_A ranks us 3rd and could also apply. Given we cannot hold offers (must accept/reject on APPLY), the decision is whether to risk waiting for D/A. Since it is already round 3 and we have a strong candidate applying now, and there is no guarantee D/A will apply to us (they may be accepted by School_D or others), it is safer to accept Student_B to avoid ending unmatched or with a lower-priority student later."
