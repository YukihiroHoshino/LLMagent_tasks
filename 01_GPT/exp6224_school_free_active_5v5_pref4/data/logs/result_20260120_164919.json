Given the market, Student_A ranks us 4th, Student_D ranks us 5th (last), Student_E ranks us 2nd; all three prefer School_D first and may or may not reach us depending on outcomes there. Since we can only accept/reject (no waitlist), accepting Student_B now risks losing the chance at higher-priority Student_E (or A/D) if they later apply. Because Student_E is relatively likely to consider us (2nd choice) and School_D has limited capacity (implied), it is worth holding the seat for a higher-priority candidate even at the risk of ending unmatched.
