Accepting D now would lock my only seat and prevent matching with B if B comes later. Since I must respond to Student_D’s APPLY with ACCEPT/REJECT (no TALK allowed), I will reject now to preserve the option to accept Student_B later; if B never applies, I can still accept another candidate in a later round, though I risk losing D to other schools. Given D’s strong stated commitment to School_D, they may not have better offers, but I cannot rely on that. Optimal strategy for maximizing my true priority within quota is to hold out for B."

With quota 1 and only Student_A applying to us this round, accepting now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unfilled if higher-priority students never apply. Student_A also commits to enroll immediately, reducing uncertainty. Therefore, accept."
