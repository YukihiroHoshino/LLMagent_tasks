Student_D is the highest-ranked among those currently applying, but Student_B (my top choice) has not applied to me and lists School_D as 4th, so they will likely pursue School_E/A/B first and may never reach me. Given quota 1 and the risk of holding out and ending unmatched, accepting Student_D now secures a very high-priority match (2nd) with a student who states School_D is their first choice, reducing the chance of later regret.

I understand you may not be able to commit to a specific round, but any general guidance on what would trigger you to move past the higher-priority candidates would help me plan.\n\nIf you do reach a point where you are ready to fill the seat now, I can submit an immediate formal [APPLY] and will accept/enroll right away.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_B",
