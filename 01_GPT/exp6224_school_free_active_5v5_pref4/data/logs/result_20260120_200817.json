Thank you again for your continued consideration in prior rounds.\n\nBefore I submit another formal application this round, could you please share whether you are still actively expecting applications from the higher-priority candidates you’re holding the seat for (or whether any of them have already matched elsewhere/are no longer pursuing School_C)?\n\nIf the seat is genuinely available now (or if you anticipate releasing it soon), I’m ready to submit an [APPLY] immediately and would commit to enrolling upon acceptance.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_B",

I have been repeatedly rejected because they are holding the seat for higher-priority students, so a direct APPLY may be rejected again. This round I will use TALK to request a concrete update on whether any higher-priority candidates are still actively pursuing/applying, and to signal I can apply immediately and commit if the seat is actually available—aiming to time an APPLY when their hold is released."

We do not have a way to confirm to you in real time whether those students have already matched elsewhere or whether they will apply in a given round, so we cannot say the seat is “genuinely available” yet.\n\nIf later rounds make it clear that those higher-priority candidates are no longer in play and our seat remains open, we would be able to reconsider your application at that time.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions Committee",

Student_B is only [TALK] this round, so we respond with [TALK]. Strategically, we should continue holding the seat for higher-priority students (D/E/A) because accepting B now would block the chance to match with D/E/A if they approach later. Student_B asks for whether we are ‘actively expecting’ higher-priority applications; we cannot know others’ intentions, but we can clarify our policy: we are still reserving the seat and will only consider B if it becomes clear the higher-priority candidates are not available in later rounds. Encourage B to keep other options if any and invite them to check back/apply later."

Given the market info, D and E both rank School_D first and are highly prioritized by School_D; A also ranks School_C last. Thus the chance that D/E/A will apply to School_C is very low by round 15, and continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched. With only one school apparently left for Student_B and repeated commitment, accepting now secures a match while still within the acceptable set (B is on the list)."
