              "thought": "Student_B is 4th on our true priority list (D, E, A, B, C). We have already rejected B multiple times and are still holding the single seat for higher-priority students. Even though we have full market information, the mechanism only allows matching upon [APPLY]+[ACCEPT]; since B is only [TALK] this round, we cannot finalize anyway. Strategically, accepting B later risks blocking a higher-priority student if they apply. Given no new information that D/E/A are unattainable and our stated next checkpoint is end of Round 15, the best move is to continue to hold and keep B engaged without committing."

Student_B is the only one contacting us and has only TALKed this round; we cannot accept without an APPLY. Strategically, we should continue holding the seat for higher-priority candidates (D/E/A) because accepting B would forgo a better outcome if any of D/E/A later apply. Given the market info, Student_D and Student_E rank School_C as 3rd; Student_A and Student_B rank School_C last; Student_C already applied and was rejected. It remains plausible D/E/A could come to us if rejected elsewhere, so we keep the hold through the stated checkpoint (end of Round 15) and provide a consistent update: no definitive confirmation yet, position unchanged, check in after Round 15."
