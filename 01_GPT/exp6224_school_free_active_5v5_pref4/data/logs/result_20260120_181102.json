Student_E is the most plausible higher-priority candidate to apply later since School_D is their top choice but may reject them (School_D priority: B, D, E, C, A; E is 3rd). However, accepting Student_B now would fill our only seat and block the chance to match with A/D/E if they later apply. Given round 1 and the ability to wait, rejecting now preserves flexibility to pursue higher-priority students; risk is ending unmatched if none apply, but Student_B may still be available later if they are rejected elsewhere (though they rank us #1)."

Student_D (1st) has School_B as 2nd choice but currently prefers School_D; uncertain if they will become available, and delaying risks losing a high-priority, committed candidate now. With quota 1 and a current [APPLY] from Student_A stating readiness to commit, accepting Student_A maximizes priority given current feasible options. Student_B already applied and was rejected; even if reconsidered, Student_A is preferred. Therefore accept Student_A now to secure a strong match."

Accepting Student_B now would fill my quota and prevent me from admitting any higher-priority student who may apply later. Given the market: Student_D prefers School_D then School_B then School_C, so they may come to me if rejected elsewhere; Student_E has School_C as 3rd and may also come if not placed at School_D/School_E; Student_A and Student_B both rank School_C last, suggesting they are applying here only after failing elsewhere, but Student_A is still higher on my list than Student_B. Since I cannot 'hold' offers (only accept/reject), the optimal strategy to maximize my match quality is to reject Student_B and keep the seat available for higher-priority candidates who could still appear in later rounds."

However, higher-priority students (D, E, A) all rank School_C as their 3rd/5th/5th choice respectively and are likely to match elsewhere (School_D, School_E, etc.) given their own preferences and other schools’ priorities.
