However, Student_E states School_E is their 2nd choice; their 1st choice is School_D, where School_D’s priority ranks Student_E 3rd, and multiple students (notably Student_B as School_D’s top priority, plus Student_D) prefer School_D first, so Student_E may not secure School_D and could be available.
