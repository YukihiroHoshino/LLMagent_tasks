Student_C is applying and willing to enroll, but I should preserve the seat in case higher-priority students (especially Student_D or Student_A) apply in later rounds. Student_D lists School_B as 2nd and may come if not accepted by School_D; Student_A lists School_B as 3rd and could also come later. Since the process runs up to 30 rounds and I’m not under pressure to fill immediately, rejecting Student_C now maintains flexibility to secure a higher-ranked match. Student_B is higher than C on my list but I already rejected them previously and they are not the target for this response; even so, the main strategic point is to hold for D/A. Therefore: reject Student_C politely."
