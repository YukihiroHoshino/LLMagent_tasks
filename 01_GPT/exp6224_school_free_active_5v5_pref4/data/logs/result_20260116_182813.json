Although we still have 1 seat, accepting B now would foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_D or Student_A, who are ranked higher and may still approach School_B later if rejected elsewhere (both have School_B relatively high: D ranks B 2nd; A ranks B 3rd). Student_B’s preference ranks School_B 3rd, so even with an acceptance they will commit per message, but strategically we should continue holding the seat to try for D or A. Given repeated prior rejections and no new information changing priorities, we should reject again this round to preserve optionality for higher-ranked students within remaining rounds."

However, Student_D ranks School_B 2nd (after School_D) and may match with School_D given School_D’s high priority for Student_D (2nd) and Student_D’s top choice being School_D, making it hard to attract. Student_A ranks School_B 3rd and may also be pulled by School_D or School_A. With round 7 and repeated applications from Student_B with a credible commitment to enroll, the risk of ending unmatched may outweigh the upside of holding out further. Accepting Student_B secures a match now and is still within the top half of our priority list."
