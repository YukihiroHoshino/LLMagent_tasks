Student_B has applied repeatedly and credibly states willingness to commit immediately. However, Student_D ranks School_B as their 2nd choice (after School_D) and Student_A ranks School_B as their 3rd choice; both could still turn to School_B if rejected elsewhere. School_D is highly demanded (top choice for A,C,D,E), so Student_D may fail at School_D and could apply to us later; similarly Student_A’s top two are School_D and School_A, which may fill. Accepting Student_B now would block us from matching with higher-priority Student_D or Student_A if they approach later. With rounds remaining and no evidence that D/A are already matched elsewhere, it is optimal to keep the seat open rather than lock in Student_B now."

Student_A ranks School_B 3rd (after School_D and School_A), so A could also come to me later. School_D’s priority ranks Student_B first and Student_D second; this makes it plausible Student_B gets School_D or School_A/E before settling, but Student_D could be displaced at School_D and then apply to me. Given we are only at Round 7 (out of 30) and I am still unmatched, accepting Student_B now would forfeit the chance to match with Student_D or Student_A, which are higher on my list and still plausibly in play.
