However, it is already round 25/30, and no higher-priority student has contacted School_C at any point; additionally, Student_D ranks School_C 3rd, Student_E ranks School_C 3rd, and Student_A ranks School_C last, making it increasingly unlikely they will apply here this late unless all earlier options fail. Student_B has demonstrated consistent willingness to enroll immediately. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of ending unmatched outweighs the diminishing chance of securing D/E/A.
