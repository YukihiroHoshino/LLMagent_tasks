Since our quota is 1, accepting Student_B now risks missing a higher-priority Student_E who may apply after trying School_D first.

However, Student_A lists School_A as 2nd choice (behind School_D), so there is a risk A will not apply if matched elsewhere first in other dynamics, but under this protocol an [ACCEPT] with an [APPLY] establishes an immediate binding match and removes both agents. Waiting could allow a higher-priority student (E/C/D) to approach later, but those students rank School_A low (C: 4th, D: 4th, E: 5th) and are likely to pursue other schools; thus the probability of landing E/C/D is low.
