              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Student_B applied this round. Our true priority ranks Student_B 4th (after D, E, A). Student_B lists School_C last, so they are likely applying after being rejected elsewhere and may later prefer other options if available, but a match locks them in. Still, holding the seat could allow a higher-priority student (D/E/A) to apply in later rounds; however there is no evidence they will approach us soon since School_C is not top for most (C had us 2nd but already rejected; D has us 3rd; E has us 3rd; A and B have us 5th). Given uncertainty and the fact we prefer any listed student to leaving unfilled, accepting Student_B now secures a filled seat with an acceptable candidate rather than risking ending unmatched."
