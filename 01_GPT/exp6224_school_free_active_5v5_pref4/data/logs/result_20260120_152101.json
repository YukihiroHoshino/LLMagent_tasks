After learning more about your program and community, I believe School_A would be an excellent fit for my goals and I would be excited to contribute as a student. If offered admission, I am prepared to accept and enroll.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_C",

After reviewing your materials and in light of our admissions priorities, we are pleased to offer you admission to School_A.

Student_C has applied and is willing to enroll if admitted. Although Student_E is my top choice, Student_E ranks School_A last and is unlikely to apply; waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower-priority student. Student_C is high on my list and has shown clear commitment, so accepting now secures a strong outcome within quota."
