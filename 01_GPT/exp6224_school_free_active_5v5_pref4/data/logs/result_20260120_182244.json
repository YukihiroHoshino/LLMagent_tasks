Student_C ranks School_A 4th and Student_D ranks School_A 4th; both currently prefer School_D (and Student_D also prefers School_B over A), so they may not come unless rejected elsewhere. Given the uncertainty and the risk of ending unmatched if I reject now, and since accepting Student_A blocks me from later higher-priority students, I weigh probability: Student_C and Student_D are likely to be absorbed by School_D/B based on their preferences and those schools' priorities.

I remain very eager to attend School_C and, if offered the seat, I will accept immediately and commit to enrolling.\n\nSince we are now in round 14 and School_C is still unmatched, could you clarify what specific market condition would make you willing to finalize the seat with me? For example: if Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, and Student_B are all already matched elsewhere (or otherwise no longer able to apply), would you then be ready to extend an offer to me upon my next formal application?\n\nIf you can share the clearest trigger you use for reassessing, I will follow it precisely and apply at the right moment.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_C",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains unmatched and it is my #2 true choice. Given repeated rejections due to priority, a [TALK] message is more strategic than another identical [APPLY]: I should ask for a concrete condition under which they would finally fill the seat with me (e.g., when all higher-priority students are matched), and signal I can commit immediately the moment that condition is met. This keeps me in consideration without triggering another automatic rejection and may prompt them to reassess now that the market is late-stage."

              "message": "Dear Student_C,\n\nThank you for your thoughtful question and for staying engaged.\n\nThe clearest trigger for us to reassess is: **when none of the higher-priority students (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, Student_B) remain “in play” to apply to School_C because they are already matched and therefore no longer participating in the market**. In that situation, we would be prepared to seriously reconsider filling our seat with you.\n\nThat said, we cannot pre-commit to an automatic offer upon your next application, because until those higher-priority candidates are definitively removed from the market, there remains a non-trivial chance one of them could still turn to School_C in a later round.\n\nIf you want to time your next [APPLY] as effectively as possible, the best moment is when you believe those four students have become matched elsewhere (and thus cannot apply anymore). If you check in again, we can give you our most current read based on who is still potentially able to approach us.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Student_C is last on School_C’s true priority list, and we prefer to keep the seat open rather than accept a lower-priority student while any higher-priority candidates (D, E, A, B) could still arrive. Student_C is asking for a clear trigger to reassess. Given the market rules, we cannot observe others’ match status directly from our perspective in this dialogue, and even if they appear matched elsewhere, shifts could still occur until the simulation ends. The best strategy is to continue TALK, provide a transparent condition: we would consider Student_C only when it is effectively impossible or extremely unlikely for any of D/E/A/B to apply (e.g., they are matched and removed from the market), and near the end of the process if we remain unfilled. Encourage Student_C to keep optionality and check back; do not commit to an automatic offer next round."

              "thought": "School_C’s true priority list ranks Student_C last, but still acceptable. No other students contacted School_C this round, and after 15 rounds no matches have been formed, suggesting higher-priority students are not engaging with School_C and may be cycling among top choices or stalled. Holding the single seat indefinitely risks ending unmatched after round 30, which is worse than filling with an included (though low-ranked) student. Student_C has repeatedly committed to enroll immediately, so accepting now secures a match and ends uncertainty. Given no evidence of imminent applications from Student_D/E/A/B, the expected value of waiting is low relative to the risk of remaining empty."
