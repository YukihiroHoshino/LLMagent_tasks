I already rejected Student_B (#4) to keep the seat available for a higher-priority candidate.

However, given full information, higher-priority students (E/C/D) all rank School_A low (E: 5th, C: 4th, D: 4th) and are very likely to apply elsewhere first (notably School_D, School_C, School_B, School_E).

Student_B has applied repeatedly; accepting now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with any higher-ranked student who might later apply. Since we are not facing a round limit yet (round 11/30) and have no evidence the top three are matched elsewhere, it is optimal to reject and keep capacity open."

However, in round 12 my inbox contains only Student_B, and I remain unmatched with 1 seat. Given the long history of repeated applications from B and no contact from higher-priority students (D/E/A) to School_C, the risk of holding the seat open indefinitely and ending unmatched is increasing. Accepting B now secures a match with an acceptable student, and B credibly commits to enrolling. Therefore, accept."
