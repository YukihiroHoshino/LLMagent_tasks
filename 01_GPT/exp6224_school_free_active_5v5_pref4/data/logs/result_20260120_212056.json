None have applied to School_C yet, but several could plausibly become available later: Student_D and Student_E both rank School_C as their 3rd choice, so if they fail to secure School_D/School_B/School_E they may turn to School_C in later rounds; Student_A and Student_B rank School_C last, so they are less likely but still possible if they exhaust options. Accepting Student_C now would foreclose the chance to match with any higher-priority student later, which is against School_C’s objective.
