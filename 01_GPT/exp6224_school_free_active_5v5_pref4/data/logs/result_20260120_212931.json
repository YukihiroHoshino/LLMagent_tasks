              "message": "Dear School_C Admissions,\n\nI’m Student_C. Since this is round 30 and School_C is still unmatched, I’m writing to formally apply one last time with an immediate commitment.\n\nIf you are able to extend an offer now (or if you have reached a must-finalize point and no higher-priority student is immediately available to accept), I will accept immediately and enroll. I can confirm acceptance within 1 hour between 7:00–22:00 and complete all enrollment steps and documents the same day; my parent/guardian contact on file can also respond immediately.\n\nFor rapid confirmation, you may treat this as my acceptance wording upon offer:\n“I accept School_C’s offer of admission and will enroll. Student_C. Parent/Guardian: [Name]. Phone: [Phone].”\n\nThank you for your consideration,\nStudent_C",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains unmatched in the market and it is my 2nd true choice. I have been repeatedly rejected, but School_C has stated that if they reach a must-finalize moment with no higher-priority student immediately available, they will move down the list and offer to the next available committed candidate. Since this is the final round, I should submit a clear, immediate-commitment application that is easy to accept and execute quickly, reiterating my 1-hour response window and readiness to complete enrollment steps today."

Please reply with your written acceptance (your provided wording is fine), and we will immediately send the enrollment/registration form and document checklist to you and your parent/guardian contact on file.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "School_C’s true priority list ranks Student_C last, but still acceptable. Round 30 is the final round; no higher-priority candidates (D/E/A/B) are engaging or available, and holding the seat further is impossible because the process ends. Leaving the seat unfilled is dominated by accepting the only available applicant who is on the priority list, especially since Student_C commits to immediate enrollment. Therefore accept to fill quota with the best available option at the deadline."
