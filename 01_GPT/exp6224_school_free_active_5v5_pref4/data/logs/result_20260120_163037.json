Given the market, Student_A ranks School_E 4th, Student_D ranks School_E 5th (last), and Student_E ranks School_E 2nd—so Student_E is the most plausible higher-priority candidate who may apply to School_E if rejected by School_D (their 1st choice) or if School_D fills with higher-priority students. Since quota is 1, accepting Student_B now risks missing Student_E (or an unlikely Student_A). Therefore, reject Student_B to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates, despite Student_B’s strong interest."

Since higher-priority students (E, C, D) have not contacted School_A and may never do so given their preferences (none list School_A highly; E lists A last, C lists A 4th, D lists A 4th), waiting is unlikely to yield a better applicant.
