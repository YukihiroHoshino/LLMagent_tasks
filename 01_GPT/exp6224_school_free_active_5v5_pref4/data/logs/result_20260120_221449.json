Student_D lists School_B as their 2nd choice (after School_D), and Student_A lists School_B as 3rd choice; both could come to me if rejected elsewhere. School_D’s top priorities include Student_B and Student_D, so D may be taken by School_D, but it’s uncertain. Given that I already rejected B earlier, but B is still a relatively high-priority candidate (3rd) and is committing to enroll immediately, the risk of ending unmatched by holding out may outweigh the upside of waiting for D/A.
