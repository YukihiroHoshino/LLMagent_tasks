Check likelihood Student_B comes to School_D: Student_B ranks School_D 4th (after E, A, B). So B is unlikely to apply unless rejected by E/A/B. Those schools’ priorities: School_E ranks B 4th; School_A ranks B last; School_B ranks B 3rd. B may get into School_B, and possibly not into E/A, meaning B might never reach School_D.

I still have 1 open seat, but accepting Student_C now would lock in my lowest-priority option and prevent a later match with any higher-priority student (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, Student_B) should they apply in subsequent rounds. Given the market is still early (round 4 of 30) and Student_C has already been rejected multiple times, it is strategically better to keep the seat open and continue waiting for higher-priority candidates rather than fill it with my lowest-ranked student."
