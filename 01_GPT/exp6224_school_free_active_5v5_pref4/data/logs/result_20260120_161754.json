All three rank School_C low-to-mid but not last: D ranks C 3rd, E ranks C 3rd, A ranks C 5th. School_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched; however, accepting B now would permanently forgo the chance to match with D/E/A if any later apply. Given repeated rounds with only B applying, the probability of higher-priority applicants may be declining, but without explicit evidence they are already matched elsewhere, the dominant strategy to maximize true priority is to continue holding the seat. Therefore reject B again, while giving a clear, non-committal guideline: we will hold through later rounds and only consider lower-priority if it becomes clear higher-priority students are no longer available (e.g., near the end of the process)."
