From preferences, Student_D ranks School_C 3rd, Student_E ranks School_C 3rd, and Student_A ranks School_C last; all three are likely pursuing School_D/E/B/A first, so they may or may not come to us later. However, holding the seat open is risky because we have no guarantee they will apply, and Student_B is offering to enroll promptly. Since Student_C already applied and was rejected (lowest priority). Accepting Student_B secures a match with an acceptable candidate rather than risking ending unmatched."
