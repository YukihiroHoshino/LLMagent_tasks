With quota 1, accepting Student_A now would block the possibility of matching with a higher-priority student. Given we prefer higher-ranked candidates and have already rejected Student_A twice, the optimal move is to reject again and preserve capacity for Student_C/Student_E."

To maximize the probability of getting any acceptable match while staying within my preference list, I will apply to School_A and signal strong commitment."

Student_C is ranked higher than Student_A on my priority list, and accepting Student_C secures a high-priority match immediately. Student_E (my top choice) has not applied to me so far and appears to prefer other schools (School_D, then School_E, then School_C, then School_B, with School_A last), so waiting for Student_E is unlikely and risks ending unmatched. Therefore, I should accept Student_C now and close the seat."

There is no current application from D or E in this round, and we already rejected Student_C twice. Holding out risks ending unmatched if D/E never apply.
