Since I can only accept one and Student_B is my top choice, I should consider whether B is likely to apply elsewhere and be unavailable if I wait. Student_B ranks School_D 4th (behind E, A, B), so B is unlikely to apply to me in early rounds and may match elsewhere quickly. Therefore, holding out for B is risky. Among current applicants, Student_D is my #2 choice (above E, C, A) and also ranks School_D #1, meaning accepting D should lock in a high-priority, stable match immediately. Given the mechanism (acceptance creates an immediate match and removes both agents), accepting D now maximizes my expected outcome versus waiting for a low-probability B. Thus, accept Student_D."
