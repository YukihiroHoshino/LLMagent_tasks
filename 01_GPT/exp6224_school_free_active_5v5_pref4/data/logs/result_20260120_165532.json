Student_A ranks School_E 4th and Student_D ranks School_E 5th, so neither is likely to apply early unless rejected elsewhere; still, they both prefer School_D strongly, which may fill with higher-priority applicants, potentially pushing them down their lists later. Student_B ranks School_E 1st but is #4 in our priority, and Student_C ranks School_E 3rd but is #5 in our priority.
