School_C explicitly invited me to submit an [APPLY] in round 25, so applying now maximizes my chance to secure the seat immediately before any higher-priority student appears. I will restate my commitment to accept immediately and withdraw all other options."

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Student_C is in the inbox this round. Under School_C’s true priority list, Student_C is the lowest-ranked (5th), but still included, so acceptable. Given the long history and our explicit invitation to apply at the round-25 reassessment, rejecting now would risk ending unmatched by round 30 with no evidence higher-priority students (D, E, A, B) will apply; there has been sustained non-engagement for many rounds. Accepting Student_C secures a match and fulfills our commitment; no competing applicants are present this round."
