With full market info, Student_D ranks School_B as 2nd choice and is highly likely to land at School_D (their 2nd priority) given School_D’s top priority is Student_B, then Student_D; Student_B prefers School_E first, so Student_B may not take School_D, making Student_D even more likely at School_D. Student_A ranks School_B 3rd and likely competes for School_D/School_A; School_A’s top priority is Student_E, so Student_A may not get School_A, but Student_A’s top is School_D where they are last priority, so they may drift to School_A/School_B later. However, there is no current application from Student_A or Student_D to School_B, and delaying risks ending unmatched. Since Student_B commits to enroll immediately and is on our acceptable list, accepting now secures a decent-ranked student rather than holding out uncertainly for Student_D/Student_A."

Given full information: Student_D ranks School_C 3rd; Student_E ranks School_C 3rd; Student_A and Student_B rank School_C last, so unlikely but still possible if rejected elsewhere late. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list and we prefer leaving unfilled to taking someone not high priority, we should continue to hold the seat.

There is no evidence those higher-priority students are unavailable; in fact, School_C is a mid-ranked option for several of them (e.g., Student_D ranks School_C 3rd; Student_E ranks School_C 3rd; Student_A/B rank it last), so a late application remains possible if their top choices reject them. Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list and willingness to leave the seat unfilled rather than take someone outside/at the bottom, the best response is to reject again while leaving the door open if circumstances change at the very end."
