With one seat remaining, accepting Student_C now would prevent matching with any higher-priority student (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, Student_B) if they apply later. History shows repeated applications from Student_C and consistent rejections; no new information changes their priority standing. Given the market, it is better to keep the seat available for higher-priority candidates rather than fill it with the lowest-ranked option."

School_C is my true #2 choice but has rejected me multiple times, and their priority list ranks me last, so another [APPLY] is very unlikely to succeed. School_A is my #4 choice, but School_A’s priorities rank me 2nd (behind Student_E). If Student_E is already matched elsewhere, I have a strong chance at School_A. To maximize the chance of matching to the best feasible remaining option, I will apply to School_A with a clear commitment."

There is no message from Student_E this round, and rejecting Student_C risks ending up with a lower-priority student (A/B) or remaining unfilled if top choices don’t apply. Accepting Student_C secures a very high-priority match within quota. Prior rejections to Student_A indicate we were holding for higher-ranked candidates; Student_C is such a candidate.

Accepting Student_A yields a high-priority match and secures our seat; rejecting would gamble on possibly attracting higher-priority Student_D or Student_E later, but there is no current indication they will apply to School_C soon (both prefer School_D/E above us).
