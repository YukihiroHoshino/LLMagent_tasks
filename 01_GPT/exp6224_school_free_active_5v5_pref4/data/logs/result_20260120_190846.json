However, higher-priority students are unlikely to apply to me in round 1: Student_A ranks School_E 4th, Student_D ranks it 5th (last), Student_E ranks it 2nd, Student_C ranks it 3rd. In particular, Student_E is likely to apply first to School_D (their 1st) where School_D ranks them 3rd behind Student_B and Student_D, so Student_E may be rejected or displaced and could later come to me. If I accept Student_B now, I lose the chance to match with Student_E (higher) if they turn to me later. Given the small market and that Student_B is highly valued by School_D (their top priority) and also prefers School_E first, rejecting risks losing a match entirely if no one else applies. But since Student_E has School_E as 2nd and is higher on my list, and Student_A/D are less likely to come, the main upside of waiting is capturing Student_E. I will reject Student_B now to preserve the seat for a higher-priority candidate, especially Student_E."

Our true priority list ranks Student_C last, but still included, and we prefer an unfilled seat only over students not on the list.

In round 27, the only inbound message is Student_C applying; no higher-priority applicants are present. Rejecting now risks ending unmatched despite having an acceptable (listed) candidate ready to commit, and would violate the credible trigger/commitment, reducing future bargaining power. Accepting secures a match within quota with a willing student and is consistent with the stated process and market realities at round 27."
