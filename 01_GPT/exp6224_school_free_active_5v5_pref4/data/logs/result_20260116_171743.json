I still have quota 1, but accepting Student_C now would permanently block the possibility of matching with any higher-priority student (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, Student_B) if they become available in the remaining rounds. Given the market information: Student_D ranks School_C 3rd (after D and B), Student_E ranks School_C 3rd (after D and E), Student_A and Student_B rank School_C last; however, even a low probability of landing Student_D or Student_E is preferable to locking in my lowest-ranked option. History shows Student_C is persistent but remains lowest priority, and I have consistently held the seat. With rounds remaining (28-30), optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Student_C to preserve optionality for higher-priority candidates, even at risk of ending unmatched, which is preferable to taking someone outside/at the bottom of my list per stated policy."

Accepting now would lock us in and prevent matching with any higher-priority student if they become available in the final rounds. Even though no higher-priority students messaged us this round, the market is dynamic and we have previously held the seat for higher-priority candidates; with round 29/30, it is still rational (per our objective) to keep the seat open rather than accept our lowest-priority option. Student_C has repeatedly applied; consistency doesn’t change our priority ranking. Therefore reject again to preserve the chance (however small) of matching with D/E/A/B."
