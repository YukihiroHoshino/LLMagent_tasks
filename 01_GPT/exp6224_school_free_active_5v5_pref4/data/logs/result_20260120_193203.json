Student_B indicates School_C is their remaining choice, suggesting low competition for them, but I should still preserve my single seat in case a higher-priority student (D, E, or A) applies in later rounds.

Since Student_B is currently only [TALK] and not forcing an accept/reject decision, the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to keep the seat available and signal that reconsideration would require a new [APPLY] and depends on availability after higher-priority candidates resolve.
