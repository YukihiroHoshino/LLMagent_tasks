However, higher-priority students (D, E, A) are still unmatched from my perspective and could still approach School_C in later rounds if they fail to secure their top choices (notably School_D and School_E). Accepting Student_B now would fill my only seat and prevent me from matching with any of D/E/A if they later apply, which would be worse relative to my objective (maximize match quality on my priority list). Since rounds remain (13/30) and there is no penalty stated for holding the seat other than remaining unmatched, the optimal move is to continue rejecting Student_B to preserve the option value of admitting a higher-priority candidate later."
