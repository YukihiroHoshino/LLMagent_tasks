We currently have 1 seat and no matches yet. Holding out for Student_D is risky because Student_D’s preferences rank School_C third (after School_D and School_B), so they may never apply or may match elsewhere first. Accepting Student_E secures a very high-priority match within quota and avoids ending up with a lower-priority student or an unfilled seat."

My main interests are advanced math/computer science (problem-solving, coding, and data-driven projects) and I enjoy collaborative work—organizing tasks, helping peers debug/solve issues, and following through to deliver results.\n\nIf admitted, I’m ready to commit and enroll at School_B. Thank you for your consideration.",

However, Student_B ranks School_B as their 3rd choice (after E and A), so they may leave if accepted elsewhere. Still, in this round only Student_B applied to us, and rejecting risks ending up with a lower-priority student later or remaining unmatched if top candidates secure other schools. Since we prefer any listed student over an empty seat, and Student_B is on our list and is applying with stated willingness to commit, accept now to lock in a reasonably high-priority match."
