No higher-priority students have contacted us so far, but they could still apply in round 30. With quota 1 and one round left, accepting C now would block a possible higher-priority match; rejecting preserves the option to take any of D/E/A/B if they appear. If none apply by the end, we can still decide then, but at round 29 we should continue holding."

No higher-priority students (D/E/A/B) have applied to us in any round, including this one, and we have no evidence they will apply now.
