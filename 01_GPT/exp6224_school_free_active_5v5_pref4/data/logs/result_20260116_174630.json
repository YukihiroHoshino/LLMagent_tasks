Likely outcomes: Student_B is top priority at School_D and may end up there if rejected, but I can risk waiting for Student_E (who prefers D then E) if D rejects them in favor of B/D. Since I cannot do conditional acceptances and an acceptance would lock my only seat, accepting Student_B now could block a better match (Student_A/D/E).

School_D is highly demanded (top for A/C/D/E; 4th for B) and has priority B > D > E > C > A, so D might or might not secure School_D; if D fails at D, they are likely to approach School_B quickly.
