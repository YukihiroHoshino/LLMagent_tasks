School_D’s top priorities are Student_B then Student_D, so Student_D may actually get School_D, reducing chance they come to us. Student_A’s top choices are School_D and School_A; they may not reach us.

School_D is the top choice for A/C/D/E and 4th for B; School_D’s top priority is B then D then E then C then A, so B is likely to be absorbed by D, and D/E are also highly competitive for D.

While that likelihood continues to decline as the process goes on, we still believe there remains a non-trivial chance that a student above you in our priority order could come to us if their preferred options close in the remaining rounds.\n\nBecause of that, a binding [APPLY] from you would still be unlikely to be accepted this round, and we don’t want you to spend effort on repeated applications we cannot responsibly invite.\n\nOn timing: we expect we may be able to make a clearer “final” determination within the next 1–2 rounds, but we cannot guarantee it. The key signal we are waiting for is that outcomes for the higher-priority students on our list appear settled elsewhere (or the market has clearly stabilized such that they are no longer likely to pivot to School_C).\n\nIf you remain interested, please check in again next round with a brief [TALK].
