I still have quota 1, so I should only accept Student_B if it is unlikely I can match with any higher-priority student (E, C, D, A). However, accepting Student_B would permanently remove my chance to match with any of those higher-priority students if they apply later. Student_B has applied repeatedly and I have consistently rejected to preserve the option for higher-priority candidates. With no new information indicating higher-priority candidates are unavailable, the optimal strategy remains to reject Student_B and keep the seat open."

Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched through round 30, which would be worse than filling with Student_B, who is on my priority list and is offering immediate commitment.
