Looking at students' preferences: Student_E ranks School_A last, Student_C ranks School_A 4th, Student_D ranks School_A 4th—so higher-priority candidates are unlikely to apply early and may never apply.

Accepting Student_C secures a match but may block a higher-priority student if they apply later. Considering late-stage dynamics (round 7) and the repeated rejections already sent, switching now could undermine credibility, but the main objective is to match as high as possible; still, matching at all is better than ending empty. Yet we explicitly prefer leaving unfilled rather than accepting someone not on the list—Student_C is on the list.
