Looking at student preferences: Student_D prefers D,B,C and could come to us if rejected by D/B; Student_E prefers D,E,C and could come to us if rejected by D/E; Student_A and Student_B rank us last, so unlikely to apply. However, with only one round remaining, and no higher-priority [APPLY] has arrived despite many rounds, probability of a last-moment higher-priority application seems low.
