From student preferences: B ranks School_E 1st, E ranks School_E 2nd, C ranks School_E 3rd, while A ranks School_E 4th and D ranks it 5th (least). So A/D are unlikely to apply here early; E is more plausible to apply if not getting School_D. Given School_D’s top priority is Student_B, Student_B may also be highly competitive at School_D but B prefers E first and is applying now. Still, maximizing our outcome suggests waiting for Student_E (ranked above B) who is more likely than A/D to consider us. Therefore reject B to keep the seat available for a higher-priority candidate."

In this round I received [APPLY] from Student_D, Student_A, Student_E, and Student_C, but not from Student_B (my top choice). With quota 1, accepting Student_D now would secure my 2nd-choice student, but it would foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_B if they apply in a later round. I should consider whether Student_B is likely to end up at School_D: Student_B’s preference list is School_E > School_A > School_B > School_D > School_C, so School_D is only their 4th choice, making it plausible they never apply unless rejected elsewhere. Meanwhile, Student_D ranks School_D as their 1st choice and is likely to commit, and Student_D is also highly desired by other schools (top at School_B and School_C, and 2nd at School_E), so delaying risks losing Student_D to another match. Given Student_D’s strong commitment and high priority (2nd) plus the low likelihood of attracting Student_B, the best strategy to maximize my outcome within quota is to accept Student_D now."
