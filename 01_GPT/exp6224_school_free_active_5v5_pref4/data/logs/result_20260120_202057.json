That said, we must still keep the seat available through the end of Round 12 in case a higher-priority student applies late in the round.\n\nOur guidance remains the same: if no higher-priority student submits an [APPLY] by the end of Round 12, please submit your [APPLY] at the start of Round 13 and we will move immediately to a final decision.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_B Admissions",
              "thought": "As School_B, my true priority is D > A > B > C > E, and I have 1 seat. Student_C is 4th on my list. Higher-priority candidates (D/A) have not contacted me so far, and B has already applied twice and been rejected; C has been persistent and is currently the only one engaging. However, accepting C now is impossible because they have not sent [APPLY] this round (they sent [TALK]) and I still want to preserve the option for D or A to apply by end of Round 12 as previously communicated. Best strategy: maintain commitment to the stated deadline, provide a clear update (no higher-priority [APPLY] received this round so far), and instruct C to submit [APPLY] at start of Round 13 for immediate decision if no higher-priority applicant appears by end of Round 12."

We already rejected B and have been holding the seat through Round 12 specifically to see if higher-priority candidates (D/A/B) would apply; none have applied to us by the end of Round 12 per our own updates. At Round 13, Student_C applied as instructed and is willing to commit immediately. Given the late stage and no evidence that D/A will approach School_B (they rank us 2nd/3rd but may already be matched elsewhere), continuing to hold risks ending unmatched. Accepting Student_C now secures a match with an eligible student on our list and aligns with our stated timeline, preserving credibility in negotiations."
