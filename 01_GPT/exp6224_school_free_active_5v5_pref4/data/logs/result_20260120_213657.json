Student_B (ranked 4th) already applied and was rejected to preserve capacity for higher-ranked options; now Student_E (ranked 3rd) is applying with commitment.

The reason is that even if we observe several quiet rounds, we still cannot reliably rule out a higher-priority candidate engaging later, and we need to keep the seat available in line with our priority order.\n\nSo our approach remains the same: we plan to hold the seat through the middle rounds and begin reassessing in the late-stage window (still approximately starting around Round 26).
