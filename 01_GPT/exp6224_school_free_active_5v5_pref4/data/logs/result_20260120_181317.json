Student_C has applied multiple times and has been rejected consistently due to priorities; nothing in the environment indicates that higher-priority students are already matched away from us, so it remains optimal to keep capacity available. Therefore, reject again."

In the broader market, Student_E ranks School_A last, Student_C ranks School_A 4th, and Student_D ranks School_A 4th, so they may come to me later if rejected elsewhere—especially since many students top-rank School_D/E. Accepting Student_A now would fill my only seat and prevent matching with E/C/D if they approach later.
