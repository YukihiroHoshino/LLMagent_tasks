Student_B has applied repeatedly and would commit, but accepting now could block a higher-priority student (Student_D or Student_A) from matching with us later. Given the market: Student_D ranks School_B as #2 (after School_D), and Student_A ranks School_B as #3; both could plausibly come to School_B if rejected elsewhere. Since we are not pressured by deadlines here and prefer maximizing our priority match, it is optimal to continue holding the seat and reject Student_B again rather than lock in a lower-priority match."

Given School_D’s priority list (Student_B first, then Student_D, then Student_E, Student_C, Student_A) and School_D being the top choice for most students, it is likely School_D will take Student_B if Student_B applies there, and Student_D may also end up at School_D. Student_A is also unlikely to reach School_B. Since we have received repeated applications only from Student_B and no higher-priority candidates are currently engaging us, continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched by round 30. Therefore, accept Student_B now to secure a match rather than gamble on unlikely arrival of Student_D/Student_A."
