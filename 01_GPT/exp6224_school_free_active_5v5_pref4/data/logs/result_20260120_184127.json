Likely many students will first approach School_D/E, so higher-priority candidates (E/C/D) may not apply to School_A soon or at all. However, rejecting Student_A risks ending unmatched if no one else applies by round 30. Given Student_A’s strong commitment and that we currently have no other applicants this round, accepting now secures a match but sacrifices the chance at C/D/E.

We are maintaining our decision to reserve the seat for higher-priority candidates on our current priority order through the close of the process.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your interest in School_C and wish you the very best going forward.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "School_C’s true priority list ranks Student_C last. Throughout rounds 11–30 we consistently reserved the seat for higher-priority students (Student_D/E/A/B) and explicitly stated intent to keep it reserved through the end. Even though the seat would remain unfilled otherwise, accepting Student_C would lower our outcome relative to our stated priority objective (and we prefer leaving unfilled to taking someone outside/at the bottom of our desired set). With round 30 being the final round, there is no future option value in continuing dialogue; we must decide on this [APPLY] now and remain consistent with our priority policy."
