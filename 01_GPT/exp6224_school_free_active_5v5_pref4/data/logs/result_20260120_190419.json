This cycle may be competitive, so a clear statement of why School_E is your first choice and how you’ll contribute can help.\n\nIf School_E is truly your first choice, you’re welcome to submit an [APPLY] as soon as you’re ready.

From students’ preferences: A ranks School_E 4th, C ranks it 3rd, D ranks it 5th (last), E ranks it 2nd, B ranks it 1st. So Student_E is a realistic higher-priority candidate who may apply if rejected by School_D (E’s top). Student_A likely goes for D/A/B before E; Student_D likely never applies to E; Student_C might apply after D/C. Therefore, keep Student_B warm via [TALK], encourage an application, but do not promise acceptance; signal competitiveness and ask for timeline while keeping option open for Student_E (and possibly A/C)."
