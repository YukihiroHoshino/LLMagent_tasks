In this round, both Student_A and Student_B applied; Student_A is higher than Student_B, so if choosing between these two now, accepting A dominates accepting B. However, given full market info, Student_E (our top choice) ranks School_A last and is likely to match elsewhere; Student_C ranks us 4th and Student_D ranks us 4th, so they may not come to us early and could be captured by higher-preferred schools. There is risk that waiting yields no better applicant reaching us, but also risk that accepting A now prevents taking C or D if they later apply. Considering Student_A has applied with commitment and is higher than B, and the probability of landing E/C/D appears limited due to their preferences and other schools’ priorities, it is prudent to secure Student_A now rather than gamble and potentially end unmatched or with a lower-ranked student."

              "message": "Dear Student_C,\n\nThank you for your final application and for your persistence throughout the process.\n\nAs this is Round 30 and no higher-priority candidate has come forward to claim our remaining seat, we are prepared to offer you admission to School_C. We are pleased to match with you.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Student_C applied in Round 30. However, School_C's true priority list ranks Student_C last and we have consistently held the seat for higher-priority students (D, E, A, B). The school prefers leaving the seat unfilled rather than accepting someone not included; Student_C is included, so accepting is permissible. But objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list; at the final round, no higher-priority candidates have contacted us at all, and there is no remaining opportunity to secure them. Rejecting would leave us unmatched, which is worse than matching with an included student when no better option exists. Therefore accept Student_C in Round 30."
