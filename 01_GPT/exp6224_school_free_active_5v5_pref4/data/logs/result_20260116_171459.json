Student_A’s preference ranks School_A 2nd (after School_D), so there is some risk they would prefer D if available, but an [ACCEPT] would lock the match if they commit. Given we can only respond to Student_A now, the optimal strategy to maximize expected priority is to reject Student_A to preserve the seat for potential higher-priority applicants, since the downside is ending unmatched if none apply by round 30.

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Our true priority list ranks Student_E first, Student_C second. Student_C has applied and is willing to commit. Waiting for Student_E is risky because Student_E ranks School_A last and is unlikely to apply; they prefer D/E/C/B ahead of us. We already rejected Student_A and Student_B (lower priority than C). Student_D has School_A as 4th choice and may not apply soon. Therefore accepting Student_C now secures a high-priority match rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked student later."
