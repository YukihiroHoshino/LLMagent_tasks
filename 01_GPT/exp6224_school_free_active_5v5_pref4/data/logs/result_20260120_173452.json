Practically, what changes our assessment is either (a) verified exit confirmation for those students, or (b) as we get deeper into the later rounds with continued non-engagement, the likelihood of their availability drops enough that we decide it is no longer realistic to hold the seat.\n\n2) Round 13 / 14 reassessment: Yes—we will conduct a more decisive reassessment in Round 13 and again in Round 14 if we still have no engagement from any of Student_D/Student_E/Student_A/Student_B and no credible exit updates. I cannot promise a final decision by Round 14, but you should expect that we will be actively evaluating whether holding the seat still makes sense at that point.\n\nOn what would help most: the only additional information that would materially change our decision is verified confirmation that one or more of Student_D/Student_E/Student_A/Student_B has received an [ACCEPT] elsewhere and has exited the market (student + school + explicit statement of exit).
