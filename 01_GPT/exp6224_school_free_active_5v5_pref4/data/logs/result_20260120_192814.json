Nothing has changed: we still have not received an [APPLY] to School_C from Student_D / Student_E / Student_A / Student_B, and our plan remains to hold the seat through Round 15 in case any of them applies.\n\nPlease follow the plan: submit your formal [APPLY] at the **start of Round 15**. If we reach Round 15 with no higher-priority [APPLY] and the seat is still open, we will review your application immediately and respond promptly based on the situation at that time.",

Student_C has only sent TALK this round, so we should not commit. History shows we’ve consistently held the seat through Round 15; changing now would undermine strategy. Best response: confirm no change, reiterate hold through Round 15, instruct them to APPLY at start of Round 15, and clarify we will act promptly if no higher-priority applicants arrive."

By Round 15 we committed to releasing the hold if no higher-priority students (D/E/A/B) applied. In this round, only Student_C applied; no higher-priority applications are in our inbox. Given the deadline we communicated and the risk of ending unmatched, accepting Student_C now secures a filled seat. Also, higher-priority students have strong preferences for other schools (D prefers D/B/C; E prefers D/E/C; A prefers D/A/B/E/C; B prefers E/A/B/D/C), making a late application to School_C possible but not assured. Our stated policy and credibility favor accepting now."
