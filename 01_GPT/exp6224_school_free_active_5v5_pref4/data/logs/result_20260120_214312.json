Based on students’ preferences, Student_D ranks School_C 3rd (after D and B), Student_E ranks School_C 3rd (after D and E), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_B ranks School_C last—so there remains a meaningful chance that Student_D or Student_E could come to us if they are rejected/blocked at their top options. Accepting Student_C now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with any higher-priority candidate later.
