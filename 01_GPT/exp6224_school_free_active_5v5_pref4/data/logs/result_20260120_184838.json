In this round, only Student_A and Student_B applied; Student_D has not applied and, based on preferences, ranks School_B as 2nd after School_D, so there is a plausible chance Student_D may come later if rejected by School_D. With quota 1, accepting Student_A now would block the chance to take Student_D. However, rejecting Student_A risks ending up with a lower-priority student (e.g., Student_B) or no match if Student_D never comes. Given we can only respond once and must decide now, and Student_A is still very high on our list (#2) and has explicitly committed to enroll, it is safer to secure a high-priority match rather than gamble on Student_D’s availability."

However, Student_B is also the top priority at School_D (School_D ranks B first), and School_D is Student_B’s 4th choice; still, Student_B may end up at School_D if rejected here, but that does not help my objective. Higher-priority students for me are A, D, and E. Student_E already applied earlier and I rejected; Student_A and Student_D have not applied to me and both rank School_E low (A ranks E 4th; D ranks E 5th), so they are unlikely to come unless they strike out elsewhere. Waiting risks ending with only lower-ranked options or no match by round limit. Given we are at round 5 (not too late) but there is no signal that A or D will apply, and B is a solid mid-high option who is committed to enroll, the best move to maximize expected outcome within quota is to accept Student_B now rather than keep rejecting and risk being forced to take Student_C or remain unfilled."
