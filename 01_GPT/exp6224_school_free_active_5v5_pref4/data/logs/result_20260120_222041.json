Concretely, if we reach approximately **round 24–26** with no higher-priority applicant to School_C materializing, we would be much more likely to begin making an offer further down our list rather than leaving the seat unfilled.\n\n2) **Likelihood of higher-priority applicants:** Yes, we still consider it **meaningfully possible** (though not guaranteed) that a higher-priority student could become unmatched elsewhere as other schools’ seats settle and then apply to School_C. That is the main reason we are still holding the seat at round 13.\n\nIf you would like a formal decision at a specific point, you’re welcome to submit an **[APPLY]** again in later rounds (especially closer to that late-stage window), and we will decide based on the situation at that time. You can also check in again around round 18–20 and we can update you on whether our assessment has changed.",

Student_B is currently only talking, not applying, so no forced accept/reject. Given round 13 (still early vs round 30) and that higher-priority students may be displaced from other schools (especially if School_D reshuffles), it is still rational to hold the seat. Provide a clear policy: we will wait until late rounds (e.g., around 24–26) unless we receive credible info that no higher-priority students remain unmatched/likely to move. Encourage Student_B to check back and/or apply in later rounds for a formal decision then."

Our true priority list is D > E > A > B > C, so Student_B is acceptable but below three higher-priority students (D, E, A). Student_B is persistently interested; however, we have been strategically holding the seat for the chance that D/E/A become unmatched and then apply. In round 21, Student_B only sent [TALK], so we cannot accept/reject; we should respond with [TALK]. We should answer: no new higher-priority outreach this round, and confirm we will make a definitive decision in round 22 upon receiving an [APPLY], consistent with prior commitments. Keep flexibility: decision depends on whether any higher-priority applicant appears by then."

Given the approaching endgame and the explicit commitment we made to provide a definitive decision at round 22, continuing to hold risks ending unfilled and would not improve our outcome unless a higher-priority student actually applies. Since no higher-priority applicant is in our inbox this round and Student_B is on our list and will commit immediately, accepting now secures a filled seat with the best available applicant at this checkpoint."
