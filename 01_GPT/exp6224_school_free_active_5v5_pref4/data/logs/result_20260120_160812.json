Student_E is both higher priority for us and more likely to apply to us early if rejected by School_D (their 1st choice). School_D prioritizes Student_B highest, so Student_B may be taken by School_D if they apply there later; however Student_B currently applies to us.

I have repeatedly rejected Student_C throughout the process to preserve the seat for higher-priority students (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, Student_B). Even in the final round, accepting Student_C would give me my lowest-priority feasible match; per my stated objective and prior stance, I prefer leaving the seat unfilled rather than accepting a student this low on my list. There are no other applicants in the inbox, but that does not outweigh the preference to remain unmatched versus taking Student_C."
