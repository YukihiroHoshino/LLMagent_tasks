Student_A ranks School_E 4th and will likely pursue D/A/B first; School_D also ranks A last, so A may cycle, but there’s no guarantee they will reach E before the 30-round limit. Student_D ranks School_E last (5th) and is very unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else. Student_E ranks School_E 2nd and is currently applying, so accepting secures a relatively high-priority match rather than risking ending unmatched.

From their preference lists, School_C is ranked: Student_D (3rd), Student_E (3rd), Student_A (5th). So D/E are plausible to approach School_C if they fail to secure top choices; A is unlikely. No higher-priority candidate has contacted us through Round 13, but with rounds remaining and our stated plan to reassess at Round 16, it is strategically optimal to keep the seat open rather than commit to B now. Continue transparency and keep the Round 16 checkpoint commitment."
