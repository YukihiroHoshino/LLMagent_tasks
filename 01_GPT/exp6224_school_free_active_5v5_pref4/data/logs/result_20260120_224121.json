School_E is my 3rd choice, and School_E ranks me last as well, but School_E is the top choice of Student_B and 2nd for Student_E, so it may fill quickly; still, I can at least express interest and gather information before committing.

Meaningful extracurricular involvement (depth over sheer number of activities) is also valued.\n\nPrograms we’re especially proud of this year include our advanced coursework offerings, student-led clubs and competition teams, and structured academic support/advisory that helps students set goals and track progress.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, what academic areas are you strongest in, and what’s one activity or project you’ve pursued deeply?

School_C has explicitly asked me to wait until Round 15 to submit an [APPLY] for best consideration, so applying now is likely premature and could just trigger another rejection. In Round 12, the optimal move is to maintain engagement with a brief [TALK] check-in, reaffirming immediate commitment if they decide to fill early, and confirming the Round 15 plan."

Student_B is persistently interested but has already been rejected multiple times because we are holding the seat for higher-priority candidates who may still apply once their top options resolve. In Round 12, Student_B only sent [TALK], so no accept/reject decision is required. Market-wise, Student_D and Student_E rank School_C as 3rd and may come if rejected elsewhere (both prefer School_D and another school first). Student_A ranks School_C last, so unlikely. Best strategy remains to keep seat open until the stated trigger (Round 15) to maximize chance of matching higher on our list, while maintaining goodwill and clear instructions to Student_B."
