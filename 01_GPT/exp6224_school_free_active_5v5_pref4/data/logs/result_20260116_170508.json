Student_B’s preferences rank School_D 4th (after E, A, B), so they are unlikely to apply to me early and may match elsewhere. Meanwhile, Student_D ranks School_D #1 and is committing immediately, giving me a high-quality, secure match. Student_E is ranked #3 by me and also ranks School_D #1, but Student_D is higher priority than E. Student_A is my last choice.

The key is having regular checkpoints (proposal → data audit → baseline model → iteration → final write-up).\n\n**Typical capstone/showcase formats** (what students often aim for):\n- A **semester capstone** with a written brief (problem, data sources, cleaning decisions, method, results, limitations, ethics/fairness) plus a short talk.\n- A **demo/showcase night** style presentation where the bar is clarity: a reproducible analysis, interpretable visuals, and a clear “so what?” for a real audience.\n\nIf you want one practical standard to follow for future projects: keep everything reproducible (clean folder structure, versioned dataset, notebook/script + README) and include a short “limitations & next steps” section—those two pieces are often what separate strong work from merely technical work.\n\n[TALK]",

Briefly show how you *reasoned* (even a short sketch of an argument or a sanity-check calculation).\n3) **The applied consequence (impact + credibility):** Show the math directly improving the project: better evaluation design, clearer uncertainty, a simpler/more interpretable model, or a decision rule that’s justified (not just “it worked”). End with what someone did differently because of your result.\n\n**A concrete template sentence pair that often works well:**\n- “I initially built X, but realized the key risk was Y (overfitting/bias/uncertainty). Learning Z in math (e.g., regularization, probability, proof-based reasoning about assumptions) let me justify A and redesign B.”\n- “That change improved C (metric/robustness/calibration) and made the recommendation usable for D (the stakeholder/decision).”\n\n**Common pitfall to avoid:** listing “I like proof-based math” and “I built an app/model” as separate achievements. Instead, make the math appear as the *turning point* that upgraded the quality and reliability of the applied work.\n\nIf you tell me what kind of project domain you like most (school/community ops, environment, sports, transit, etc.), I can suggest one specific “math concept → project lever” pairing that fits naturally.\n\n[TALK]",
