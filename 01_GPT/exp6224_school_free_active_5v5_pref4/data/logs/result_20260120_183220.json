If you are still prepared to enroll immediately as stated, we are pleased to confirm your place.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We are School_C with quota 1 and must maximize match quality per our true priority list: D > E > A > B > C. Student_C is last on our list but still acceptable. However, throughout rounds we held the seat anticipating higher-priority students (especially D and E) might apply. Now it is Round 30 (final round), and no other students are in the inbox; we are currently unmatched and would otherwise end with an unfilled seat. Since we prefer leaving unfilled only over students not on our list, and Student_C is on our list, accepting Student_C in the final round strictly improves our outcome versus remaining unmatched. Therefore accept."
