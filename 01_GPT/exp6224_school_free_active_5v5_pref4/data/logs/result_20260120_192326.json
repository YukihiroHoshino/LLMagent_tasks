However, if they fail to get School_D, Student_E may apply to School_E as second choice, and Student_A might apply later as 4th choice.

Student_A ranks School_E 4th and is likely to pursue School_D/A/B first; School_D also has A last, so A may get rejected there but could land at School_A or School_B before reaching me. Student_D ranks School_E last, making it very unlikely they will apply to me unless rejected everywhere else. Student_E ranks School_E 2nd and is likely to commit if accepted; also School_D ranks E 3rd and could take E, but E prefers D over E, so they might be matched elsewhere if I delay.
