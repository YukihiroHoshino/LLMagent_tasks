However, Student_D ranks School_B as their #2 choice (after School_D) and may apply to us if not accepted by School_D; similarly Student_B ranks us #3. Since our quota is 1, accepting Student_A now could forgo a chance at Student_D, our top choice. Given School_D’s top priority is Student_B and many students rank School_D first, Student_D might not get School_D and could come to us soon. Therefore, strategically reject now to keep the seat available for Student_D, even though it risks ending unmatched if Student_D never applies."
