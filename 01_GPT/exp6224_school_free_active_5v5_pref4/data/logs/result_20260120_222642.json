E ranks School_E 2nd and commits if admitted, so acceptance is secure. If we reject E now to wait for A/D, we risk ending with a worse match or unfilled seat.

In this round only C contacted us, but accepting C now would foreclose the chance to match with D/A if they approach later. Student_C is asking via [TALK] whether seat is available and what is needed; we should respond with [TALK], keep flexibility, and signal that admissions is based on priority order and that we cannot pre-commit without an [APPLY] and without knowing if higher-priority candidates will apply.
