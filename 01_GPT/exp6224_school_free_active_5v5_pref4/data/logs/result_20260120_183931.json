While Student_B has E as 1st choice (good for commitment), School_E’s objective is to match as high as possible on its priority list.

Student_C is applying now and states readiness to commit. There is no message from Student_E this round, and delaying risks losing Student_C to their higher-preferred options (School_D, School_C, School_E) in subsequent rounds. Since Student_C is a very high-priority candidate and acceptance fills our only seat with a near-top choice, the best strategy is to accept now rather than hold out for uncertain access to Student_E."

Given remaining market, higher-priority students (D, E, A) all rank School_C as 3rd/5th/5th respectively, so they are unlikely to apply soon, but could if rejected elsewhere. However, waiting risks ending unmatched. Student_B is applying now with commitment, and accepting secures a match with someone on my list. Since I cannot later switch once matched, this is a tradeoff; but given low likelihood of D/E/A coming to me and the cost of staying empty, I will accept Student_B."
