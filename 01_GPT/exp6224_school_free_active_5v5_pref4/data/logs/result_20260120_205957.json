Student_A ranks School_E 4th, Student_D ranks it 5th, Student_E ranks it 2nd and may come if not accepted by School_D. Given School_D’s top priority is Student_B, Student_B may be accepted by School_D if they apply there, but right now Student_B is applying to us and considers us first-choice. However, accepting now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the chance to match with A/D/E. Therefore, reject to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates."
