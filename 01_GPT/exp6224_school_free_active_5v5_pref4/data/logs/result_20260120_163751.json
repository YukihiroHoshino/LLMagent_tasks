Student_B ranks School_E first, so accepting now would secure a match but risks losing the chance to match with a higher-priority student. Since we can reject now and potentially still match later with B if others don’t apply, the optimal strategy to maximize priority is to reject at this time and keep the seat open for higher-ranked candidates."
