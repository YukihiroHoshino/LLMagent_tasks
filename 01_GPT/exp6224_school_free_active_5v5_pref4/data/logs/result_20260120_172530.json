Student_E strongly prefers School_D first but may not get it due to School_D prioritizing Student_B first; however Student_B is currently applying to us, not School_D, so School_D may take Student_B if he applies there later, potentially leaving Student_E to apply to School_E.

Our only repeated engagement has been with you.\n\nThat said, because higher-priority students can still become unmatched elsewhere and decide to apply to School_C in a later round, we still cannot treat the higher-priority pool as definitively cleared.\n\n2) On your proposal: we are not able to set a specific “by Round X” condition under which we would commit in advance to offering you the seat if no higher-priority [APPLY] arrives. We need to keep the seat available in line with our priority order through the remainder of the process.\n\nI understand this is frustrating and makes planning difficult. If your situation changes and you receive a firm option elsewhere, you should prioritize certainty. If at any point circumstances change on our side such that we can extend an offer consistent with our priority order, we will respond accordingly.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

With quota 1, accepting Student_C now would forfeit the chance to match with any higher-priority student later.
