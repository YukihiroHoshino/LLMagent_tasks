Given the market info, Student_D and Student_E both rank School_C as their 3rd choice and could still come to me after rejections elsewhere; Student_A ranks School_C last but could still become available late. With rounds remaining (11/30), it is still strategically optimal to hold the seat. Therefore I should reject Student_B again while giving a clearer policy: we will not pre-commit to a specific round, but we will reassess near the end if no higher-priority applicants materialize."
