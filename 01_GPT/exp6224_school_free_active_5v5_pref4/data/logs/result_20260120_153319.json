Given students’ preferences: A ranks E 4th, C ranks E 3rd, D ranks E 5th, E ranks E 2nd, B ranks E 1st. School_D is the top choice for most students, so A/D/E may initially pursue D and could later turn to E if rejected. Since I can’t “hold” an application (must accept/reject), optimal is to reject B now to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates who may come later, especially Student_E (E’s 2nd choice) and possibly Student_A or Student_D if they strike out elsewhere."

While I have explored other options earlier in the process, I want to be clear that I genuinely respect what School_C offers and, if admitted, I am ready to accept and enroll.\n\nI would contribute as a student who is academically serious and collaborative: I consistently challenge myself, I enjoy working through difficult material carefully, and I often help classmates by explaining concepts and staying dependable in group work. I also value being part of a respectful community where students support each other and take initiative.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I would be grateful for the opportunity to join School_C.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_A",

Student_C already applied and was rejected (lowest priority). No other applicants in the inbox this round. While holding out could potentially yield Student_D or Student_E later, both students currently rank School_C as their 3rd choice and may match earlier with School_D/School_E, making the chance of receiving their application uncertain. Given we can secure a relatively high-priority candidate now and avoid ending unmatched, accept Student_A."
