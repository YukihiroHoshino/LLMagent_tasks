Risk: we may end up unmatched if none apply, but with multiple rounds remaining and School_A being 2nd choice for A/B and 4th for C/D and last for E, there is still a plausible path for C or D to reach School_A if rejected elsewhere.

B is acceptable but not top-tier; however, holding the seat risks ending unmatched if D/E/A never apply. Given the market: Student_D ranks School_C 3rd (after D and B) so may apply later if rejected elsewhere; Student_E ranks School_C 3rd (after D and E) and could also come later; Student_A ranks School_C last and is unlikely to apply. With only 1 seat, accepting B now would block potentially higher-priority D or E later.
