However, accepting now risks losing a chance at Student_E/Student_C/Student_D if they unexpectedly apply later. With limited rounds and no other inbound applicants to School_A, taking Student_A is a safe fill, but Student_A may later prefer an offer from School_D if available—yet matches are binding in this simulation once accepted.

Given the market, higher-priority students for School_C are Student_D, Student_E, Student_A, then Student_B. It remains possible that one of these higher-priority students will apply to us in rounds 25–26 as they are rejected or displaced from their preferred schools (notably School_D is top for many and will only take one; School_E and School_B also create competition). Accepting Student_C now would block us from matching with any higher-priority student later, which would be strictly worse for our objective. Student_C is only [TALK] this round, so we should maintain prior guidance: nothing changed; apply at round 27 if still unfilled."

Student_E ranks School_C 3rd but also strongly prefers School_D and School_E ahead; School_D prioritizes Student_B then Student_D then Student_E, so Student_E may still have paths elsewhere. Student_A and Student_B both rank School_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. Historically, no higher-priority student has engaged with us through 26 rounds, making it increasingly unlikely they will in rounds 27–30. Since Student_C is on my acceptable list (though lowest), filling the seat with Student_C now is better than risking ending unfilled, and accepting establishes a match immediately."
