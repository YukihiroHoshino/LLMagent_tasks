Given the rules, an [ACCEPT] creates an immediate match and removes us from further negotiation, so the optimal move to maximize School_E’s priority outcome is to reject Student_B and keep the seat available for Student_A. Student_B is 4th on our list, so only acceptable if higher-ranked options are unavailable later, but we cannot defer with [TALK] on an [APPLY]."
