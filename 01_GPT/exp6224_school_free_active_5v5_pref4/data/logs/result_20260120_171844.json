However, higher-priority candidates exist: Student_D (top), Student_E (2nd), Student_A (3rd), Student_B (4th). We have held the seat throughout because those candidates could still pivot. Check preferences: Student_D ranks School_C 3rd (after D, B) so could come if rejected by D and B; Student_E ranks School_C 3rd (after D, E) could come if D and E fail; Student_A and B rank School_C last so unlikely. As late as round 23, risk of ending unfilled rises, but accepting Student_C would forgo chance of D or E if they pivot in remaining rounds. Given we still have 7 rounds and D/E have plausible paths to pivot, continue to hold; provide clear signal that only near end (e.g., rounds 28–30) we might consider Student_C, and an APPLY before then is unlikely to be accepted."
