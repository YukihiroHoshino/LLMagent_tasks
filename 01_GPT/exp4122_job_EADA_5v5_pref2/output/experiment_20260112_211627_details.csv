Seeker_B applies to Company_E first and is top priority there (but behind me at E), so B is unlikely to compete for C early; Seeker_A and Seeker_D also start at Company_E, making it plausible that only one of them later targets C. If I lose C, my best attainable fallback is Company_A: although I am last in A’s priority, the top candidates for A (B and D) are strongly pulled toward E/C respectively, and A is still a better outcome for me than D/B/E. I place Company_D next because I have better priority there than Seeker_B and D is a realistic alternative if A is taken. Company_B is fourth since I have mid priority and it is likely to be taken by higher-priority seekers. Company_E is last because it is my least preferred, even though I have top priority there, and I only want it as a safety net if all others fill.",True,Company_C,True,True,1
