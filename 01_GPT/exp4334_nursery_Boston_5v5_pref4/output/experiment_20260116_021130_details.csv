You are #1 priority at Nursery_D, so applying there first guarantees you a seat immediately. If you instead apply first to Nursery_E (where you are 4th), you will be rejected because Parent_A applies there and has higher priority; then in Step 2 Nursery_D would already be filled (Parent_A switches to Nursery_D and beats other applicants there except you, but you wouldn’t be applying to D in Step 1), leaving you with only worse options.
