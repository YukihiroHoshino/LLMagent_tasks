In Step 1, Company_B’s top priority is Seeker_E and Company_C’s top priority is Seeker_B, so applying to B or C first will not create a loop involving me. Company_D, however, identifies me as its top priority, so if I apply to Company_D first, I form an immediate 2-cycle (I apply to D, D identifies me) and get admitted right away. Given the other seekers’ first choices (A/B/C) and companies’ top priorities, this also prevents me from being left competing for lower-priority spots later. Thus I place Company_D first to secure a guaranteed match; the remaining companies are ordered by my true preferences.",False,Company_D,False,True,5

I rank Company_D second because Company_D identifies Seeker_D first, and Seeker_D applies to Company_B first; that tends to create an early loop among others that can remove competitors and leave me to be identified by Company_A (where I am top priority) once Company_A’s initial match is resolved. Placing Company_A third preserves the strong fallback: Company_A ranks me #1, so once Company_A has an open seat while I remain unmatched, I am very likely to be identified and can be secured via a loop. Company_E and Company_B are last because I am not top priority at either (Company_E ranks me 4th; Company_B ranks me 1st but it is my least-preferred option), so I want to avoid being locked into them prematurely.",True,Company_C,False,True,1

Company_A is third and can become available after Seeker_E and Seeker_D are absorbed elsewhere; Company_E ranks me first, so placing it fourth provides a strong fallback if higher-ranked firms fill.

This admits me to Company_A immediately if I list A first. Any attempt to list B or C first would instead place me into the other natural first-round cycles (e.g., Seeker_B→B leads to a cycle that admits me to Company_B; Seeker_B→C creates a mutual match with Company_C), which are worse than Company_A on my true preferences.

If I apply to Company_B first, I am Company_B’s top remaining priority after Seeker_E is removed, so I can secure Company_B in the next step.
