If I rank Company_A first, in round 1 Company_A points to Seeker_E (its top), and Seeker_E points to Company_C; Company_C points to me (Seeker_B), and I point to Company_A, forming the cycle B→A→E→C→B, which immediately admits me to Company_A (my top true choice). Any deviation from putting Company_A first risks me being captured by a different cycle and ending at Company_B or Company_C instead. Therefore I should submit my true order with Company_A first.",True,Company_A,False,True,1

Under TTC, it is a dominant strategy to report your true preference order—misreporting cannot get you a better outcome and can make you worse off. Given all seekers’ preferences and companies’ priorities, reporting truthfully yields the best achievable match for Seeker_C under these rules.",True,Company_B,False,True,1

Company_B and Company_C both identify other seekers above me (B identifies Seeker_E first; C identifies Seeker_B first), so applying there first is unlikely to create a direct match. Company_A identifies me second (after Seeker_E), and Seeker_E’s top choice is Company_C (not Company_A), which makes it plausible that Company_A can identify me early among remaining seekers, improving my chance to lock in a top-3 option. Therefore I place Company_A first, then keep my remaining true preferences in descending order.",False,Company_D,False,True,5

Company_C is my top choice, but Company_C’s highest-priority seeker is Seeker_B, and Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_A. Company_A’s highest-priority seeker is me (Seeker_E). This creates an immediate closed loop if I apply to Company_C: E→C, C identifies B, B→A, A identifies E. Under the rules, everyone in the loop is permanently matched in Step 1, so I secure Company_C (my #1). Any deviation (e.g., applying to Company_D or Company_A first) would yield a worse match than Company_C.
