Under TTC, reporting your true preference order is a dominant strategy: you cannot improve your final assignment by misreporting, because cycles are formed based on who points to whom (students to schools via reported rankings; schools to students via fixed priorities). Any attempt to rank a less-preferred school higher can only risk placing you into an earlier cycle with that worse school, and cannot help you obtain a more-preferred school than you would get by telling the truth. Therefore, submit your true preference list unchanged to guarantee your best achievable outcome.",True,School_E,False,True,1

Under TTC, reporting your true preference order is a dominant strategy (you cannot improve your outcome by misreporting). Given all schools have 1 seat and School_D’s top priority is Student_B (so I won’t be identified by School_D in the first round), the best I can do is still achieved by listing schools in my true order so that if/when School_C becomes available in later rounds I point to it immediately rather than wasting a round on a less-preferred school.

In Step 1, each student applies to their first choice and each school points to its top-priority remaining student. School_D’s top priority is Student_B, so Student_B gets School_E in a self-loop (School_E points to Student_A, Student_A applies to School_D, School_D points to Student_B, Student_B applies to School_E). After removing Student_B and School_E, School_D then points to Student_D while Student_D applies to School_D, creating a self-loop that assigns me to School_D immediately. Any misreport that does not rank School_D first risks losing this guaranteed self-loop and ending up at a worse school, with no upside because School_D becomes available to me once Student_B is removed regardless.",True,School_B,False,True,2

With complete information and strict priorities, TTC is strategy-proof for students: you cannot get a better outcome by misreporting your ranking, and misreporting can only weakly hurt you.
