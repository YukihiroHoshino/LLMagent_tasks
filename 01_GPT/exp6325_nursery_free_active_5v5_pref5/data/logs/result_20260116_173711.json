Nursery_E is 4th on my list but crucially ranks me #1 in its priority list, so applying now should secure a match rather than risking ending up with my last choice (Nursery_D) or unmatched after rejections.

Given that several parents rank Nursery_C as a high choice (A, C, D have it 2nd; B has it 3rd), it is plausible higher-priority candidates will approach in early rounds.

By rejecting now, I keep the seat open for higher-priority parents who are plausibly available in subsequent rounds.

Still, to maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority parent, it is better to keep the seat open rather than commit to Parent_C immediately in round 1, since accepting Parent_C would block a later higher-priority match.
