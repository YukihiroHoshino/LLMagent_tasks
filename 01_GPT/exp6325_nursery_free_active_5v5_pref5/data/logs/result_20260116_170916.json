Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A, so they may not come to me unless rejected by A; Nursery_A prioritizes E and D above B, so B could be rejected there and then apply to me in a later round. Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C and also ranks me last, so unlikely to apply to me early (or at all). Given current certainty and that Parent_C is a strong candidate who lists me first, accepting now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked applicant if Parent_B never reaches me.

Parent_B’s top choices are A then B then C; Parent_C’s top choices are B then C; Parent_D’s top choices are B then C. Nursery_B is the first choice for both C and D, and also high for B, so they may concentrate on B first. However, C is also the #2 choice for C and D and #3 for B, so there is a reasonable chance one of them applies later. Since we are in round 1, holding the seat could secure a higher-priority match. Parent_E has C as first choice and is a decent fallback. Risk: if I reject now, E may go to another nursery (D is E’s #2) and I might later end up unmatched if B/C/D never come.
