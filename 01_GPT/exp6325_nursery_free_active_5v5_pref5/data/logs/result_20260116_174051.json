Given the market: Parent_B’s top choices are Nursery_A then Nursery_B, so they may not come to us early; Parent_C and Parent_D both rank Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_B), so if they fail at Nursery_B they are likely to apply to us soon. Since we have quota 1 and can only accept one, accepting Parent_E now risks blocking higher-priority Parent_C or Parent_D (or possibly Parent_B) in upcoming rounds. Therefore, reject Parent_E to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates."

In round 1, Parent_B applied to us as their first choice, which is positive, but we should consider the likelihood of receiving a higher-priority applicant (E/D/A). Parent_E prefers Nursery_C then D then A (3rd), so they may not approach us early; Parent_D prefers B then C then A (3rd); Parent_A prefers B then C then A (3rd). Given these preferences, it is plausible that E/D/A will first apply elsewhere and may later come to us if rejected, meaning accepting Parent_B immediately could block a better match. Since we can reject now and keep the seat open, and there is no penalty stated for rejecting early, the optimal strategy to maximize our matched parent rank is to reject Parent_B and wait for higher-priority candidates."
