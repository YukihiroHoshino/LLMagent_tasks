Although Parent_E and Parent_B are preferred overall, neither has applied this round and may not apply soon (Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second but may apply to Nursery_A first). To secure a high-priority match within quota and avoid losing Parent_C to another nursery (C’s top choice is Nursery_B, but could move to Nursery_C next), it is optimal to accept Parent_C now rather than reject and risk ending with a lower-ranked parent or an unfilled seat."

Also, Parent_B has Nursery_A as 1st choice and is likely to accept quickly, but that benefits Parent_B more than Nursery_A given our objective.
