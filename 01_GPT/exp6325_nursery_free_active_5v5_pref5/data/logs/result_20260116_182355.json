Given the market, Parent_B (our top choice) prefers A then B then C, so they may come to us if rejected by A/B; Parent_C and Parent_D both rank B first then C, so they are also plausible future applicants to us. Since it is only round 1 and we have quota 1, accepting Parent_E now risks forgoing higher-priority candidates who are likely to approach Nursery_C soon.
