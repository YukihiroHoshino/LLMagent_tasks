Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_A ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 3rd; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 4th. So Parent_D/Parent_A are very unlikely to apply here unless rejected elsewhere late. Parent_C is the most plausible higher-priority applicant. Given the rules, I cannot ‘hold’ an application—must accept or reject now. To maximize chance at higher-priority Parent_C, I should reject Parent_E now and hope Parent_C comes; risk is ending unmatched if Parent_C never applies. But Parent_C prefers B and C over D and those nurseries may accept others first (their priorities: Nursery_B ranks C 3rd; Nursery_C ranks C 2nd), so Parent_C might still land elsewhere. Still, the only realistic improvement over Parent_E is Parent_C, and the chance may be moderate. Decision: reject Parent_E to keep slot open for Parent_C."
