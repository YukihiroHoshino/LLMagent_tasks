However, Parent_E is my top priority and may apply to me later only if rejected elsewhere (E prefers C, D, A, E, then B last), so unlikely to come to me early. Parent_B prefers A first then B, so could come to me if not accepted by A; but Nursery_A ranks B 4th and may accept D/A ahead, so B might still be available later. Still, with quota 1 and two applicants now, accepting C secures a higher-ranked match than D and avoids risk of ending with A or empty if B never comes. Therefore accept Parent_C now."
