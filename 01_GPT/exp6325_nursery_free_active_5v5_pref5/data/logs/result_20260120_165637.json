Since round 1 and no other applicants in inbox, it is strategically better to reject Parent_B now to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates who are likely to seek alternatives after attempting their top choices. Risk: those higher-priority parents could match elsewhere before applying, but early-round patience is still optimal given the priority ordering and that Nursery_A is at least mid-ranked for several of them."
