Since accepting Parent_E now would fill my only seat and prevent matching with a higher-priority parent later, the optimal strategy to maximize my outcome is to reject Parent_E at this stage and keep capacity available for B/C/D."

However, strategically, rejecting Parent_E preserves my seat for higher-priority parents who are likely to apply later: Parent_D and Parent_A both rank Nursery_D last, so they are unlikely to come; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 3rd and may apply if rejected by B/C; Parent_B ranks D 4th and is last on my list.
