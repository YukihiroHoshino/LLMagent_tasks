Among these, Parent_C is the highest on my list (rank 3), ahead of Parent_D (rank 4) and Parent_A (rank 5). Although Parent_B and Parent_E are higher, neither has contacted me this round. Given quota=1 and the mechanism that an ACCEPT creates an immediate match excluding us from further negotiations, accepting Parent_C now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-priority applicant later. Parent_C also states Nursery_B is their first choice, so acceptance is likely stable. Therefore, accept Parent_C."

Meanwhile, higher-priority parents for me (D/A/C) all rank Nursery_D last or 3rd: Parent_D ranks D last; Parent_A ranks D last; Parent_C ranks D 3rd. Those higher-priority parents are likely to apply first to Nurseries_B/C (and A/E), so I may not receive applications from them soon, but it’s still possible later (especially Parent_C after rejections). Accepting Parent_E now would lock my only seat and prevent matching with a higher-priority parent if they apply later. Since the game allows continued rounds and I am not forced to fill immediately, I will reject Parent_E to preserve the chance of receiving Parent_C (or others higher) later, even at the risk of ending unmatched."
