Accepting Parent_E yields our top-ranked feasible match and immediately fills our single seat with the best possible candidate; there is no benefit to delaying since we cannot do better than E. Prior rejections to D and A do not matter now; we can still accept E. Parent_E also indicated willingness to confirm promptly, reducing risk of mismatch. Therefore accept Parent_E and close the seat."
