However, we might prefer to wait for higher-priority Parent_E or Parent_B. Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C (and ranks Nursery_B last), so unlikely to apply to us early unless rejected elsewhere. Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A and has Nursery_B as second; Parent_B may apply to Nursery_A first and only come to us if not accepted. If we reject Parent_C now, we risk ending up with lower-ranked A/D later or going unfilled if higher-ranked candidates never apply within 30 rounds. Since Parent_C states Nursery_B is first choice and is applying now, securing a solid (third-best) match is prudent. Therefore accept Parent_C."
