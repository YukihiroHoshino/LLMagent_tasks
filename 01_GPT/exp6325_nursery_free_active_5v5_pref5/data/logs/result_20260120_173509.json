Given parents’ preferences, Parent_A and Parent_D both rank Nursery_E 4th, Parent_C ranks it 4th, Parent_B ranks it 5th, and Parent_E ranks it 4th (already rejected). It is plausible that higher-priority parents may come to me in later rounds if they are rejected by their top choices (especially since many parents concentrate on B/C/A first). Therefore I should keep the seat open and reject Parent_D again."
