Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after C and D), so they may first approach Nursery_C and Nursery_D; they are also top priority for several nurseries, so they may match elsewhere before reaching me. Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 3rd as well (after B and C), and Nursery_B and Nursery_C both rank Parent_D below other candidates, so Parent_D could eventually apply to me, but it is uncertain and could take multiple rounds. Given the mechanism, if I accept Parent_A now, I secure a reasonably high-priority match (3rd) and eliminate the risk of ending up with a worse match or unfilled seat if E/D never come.

As you indicated you would begin contacting the next eligible family at the start of Round 14 if no higher-priority confirmed acceptance was received by the end of Round 13, I would like to formally apply again for the remaining place.\n\nIf you are able to offer us the place, I can confirm enrollment immediately today (same day), and you already have our key details on file. Could you please confirm whether any higher-priority family has now provided a confirmed acceptance, and if not, whether you are now able to proceed with offering the place to us?\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Given Nursery_E stated they would begin contacting the next eligible family at the start of Round 14 if no higher-priority acceptance arrived by end of Round 13, I should submit a clear, formal [APPLY] now to be immediately considered and to signal readiness to confirm same-day, while politely asking for a definitive status update on whether a higher-priority family has now accepted."

              "thought": "As Nursery_E, my true priority is A > C > B > E > D. Parent_E is 4th, acceptable but not ideal. In Round 14, only Parent_E is in my inbox, but higher-priority parents (A/C/B) may still be unmatched and could apply later; however, continuing to delay risks ending unmatched by Round 30. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and can confirm immediately, offering high certainty. Given we already committed to moving down the list in Round 14 if no higher-priority acceptance arrived, and no such acceptance has been received, the credible and payoff-maximizing move now is to accept Parent_E to secure a match rather than gamble on late applications from A/C/B."
