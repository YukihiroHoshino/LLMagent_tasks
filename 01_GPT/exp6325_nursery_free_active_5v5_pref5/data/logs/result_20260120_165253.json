They may be rejected by Nursery_B due to B’s higher priorities (E, B, C, D, A) and competition, which could push them to apply to Nursery_C in later rounds. Since quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now would block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Parent_B/C/D.

Check parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_A ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D third; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D fourth. So the only higher-priority parent with a realistic chance to apply soon is Parent_C (and possibly Parent_B, though they are lowest priority for us). Given Parent_E is applying now and is relatively high on our list, and higher-priority candidates are unlikely to come (D/A) or may be captured by B/C before reaching us (C), it is rational to accept Parent_E to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."

Nursery_A remains one of our top choices, and if offered a seat we are ready to accept immediately and commit.\n\nWe can also be flexible on start date and any onboarding requirements if that helps with planning. I’d be very grateful for your reconsideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_A",

              "thought": "Nursery_A has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. True priority order is E > D > A > B > C. Parent_A is acceptable and ranks 3rd. Top two (Parent_E, Parent_D) have not applied to Nursery_A yet and both prefer other nurseries over Nursery_A (E ranks A 3rd; D ranks A 3rd), so they may never reach us or may do so only after rejections elsewhere. Waiting risks ending unmatched; accepting Parent_A now secures a relatively high-priority match. Parent_A is also willing to accept immediately and is flexible, reducing risk. Therefore accept."
