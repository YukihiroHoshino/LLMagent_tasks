To maximize the chance of securing a high-ranked match quickly, I will apply to my #2 choice Nursery_C, where I am also ranked last but competition may be slightly less concentrated than at Nursery_B (and Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C, but Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_B/Parent_C/Parent_D above others). Getting an early application in may still help if higher-priority applicants go elsewhere. If rejected, I can pivot next round to Nursery_B or Nursery_A."

Given Parent_E ranks me last and is unlikely to apply here early, and Parent_B’s first choice is Nursery_A (so they may not apply to me unless rejected there), an immediate accept of Parent_C secures a reasonably high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked parent later. With quota 1, accepting now ends my search but is strategically safe given the low likelihood of landing Parent_E or Parent_B soon."
