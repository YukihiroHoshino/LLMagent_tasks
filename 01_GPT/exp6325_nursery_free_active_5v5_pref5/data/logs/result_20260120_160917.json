Nursery_B is my 2nd choice and ranks me 2nd in its priority list (only behind Parent_E), giving me a strong chance to secure a match early. To maximize the probability of matching with a very high-ranked option, I will apply to Nursery_B in round 1."

In this round I received applications from B, C, D, and A, but not from E (my top choice). Accepting Parent_B now would secure my second-best option and prevent me from later taking Parent_E if they apply in a future round. Since multiple high-ranked candidates are currently available (B and C especially), and Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C (so they may never apply to me), there is a tradeoff between waiting for a possibly unattainable top choice and locking in a strong match. Given Parent_B is my #2 and is applying now with readiness to confirm, accepting is a strong outcome and likely stable (Nursery_B is Parent_B’s #2; they might prefer Nursery_A, but they already chose to apply here this round). I will accept Parent_B to secure a high-priority match rather than risk ending with a lower-ranked parent or no match."
