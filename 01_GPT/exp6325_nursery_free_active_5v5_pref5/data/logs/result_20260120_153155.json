Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st and has applied immediately, making them a secure match now. However, accepting now would foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority parents who may approach in later rounds. Given the early round and reasonable likelihood that at least one of Parent_B/Parent_C/Parent_D could become available to Nursery_C after rejections elsewhere, it is strategically better to reject Parent_E now to keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates."

Given Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 3rd and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 3rd, there is a realistic chance one of them may approach after being rejected by their higher choices (they both prefer B and C first).

In this round I received APPLY messages from Parent_C, Parent_D, and Parent_A. Among these, Parent_C is the highest on my list, so accepting Parent_C dominates accepting D or A. While Parent_E and Parent_B are ranked above Parent_C, neither has contacted me this round; waiting is risky because Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A and Parent_E’s last choice is Nursery_B, so neither is likely to apply soon (if at all).
