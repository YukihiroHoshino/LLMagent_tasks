Given parents' preferences: Parent_B prefers A then B then C; Parent_C prefers B then C; Parent_D prefers B then C; Parent_A prefers B then C. Nursery_B and Nursery_A are likely to attract many first-choice applications, so higher-priority parents (especially B/C/D) may be rejected/overflow and come to us soon.
