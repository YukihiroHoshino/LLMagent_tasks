Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A (then me), so they likely apply to Nursery_A first; Nursery_A’s top priorities include Parent_E and Parent_D ahead of Parent_B, so Parent_B might get rejected and come to me later, but that’s uncertain. Parent_E ranks me last, so they are very unlikely to apply to me at all.
