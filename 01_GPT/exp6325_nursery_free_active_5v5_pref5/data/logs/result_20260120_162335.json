If we accept Parent_E now, we lose the chance to take B/C/D later due to quota=1.

On Nursery_E’s true priority list, Parent_A is ranked #1, while Parent_D is ranked #5 (lowest but still acceptable). Since accepting Parent_A yields the best possible outcome for Nursery_E and an agreement locks the match immediately, there is no strategic reason to delay or risk losing Parent_A to another nursery. Therefore, accept Parent_A now."
