Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_A ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 3rd; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 2nd. So the most plausible higher-priority candidate to approach us is Parent_C (3rd choice) if rejected by Nursery_B and Nursery_C. Since we must decide on an [APPLY] now (no waitlist option), the strategy to maximize chance of matching higher on our list is to reject Parent_E and keep capacity open for Parent_C (or, less likely, Parent_D/Parent_A). Risk: we may end unmatched if no one else applies, but objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, not to maximize fill probability."
