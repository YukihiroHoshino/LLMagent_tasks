Given the market, Parent_B and Parent_C both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice, and Parent_D ranks Nursery_C as 2nd; they are likely to apply to Nursery_B first, but could come to Nursery_C in later rounds. Since quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now would prevent matching with higher-priority parents if they later apply. With only one applicant currently and ample rounds remaining, it is strategically better to reject Parent_E now to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates."

Given quota=1 and the risk that waiting could lead to losing a guaranteed high-ranked applicant (and that Parent_B’s first choice is Nursery_A, while Parent_E’s first choice is Nursery_C, so they may never apply to me), accepting Parent_C now maximizes my expected outcome versus rejecting and holding out.
