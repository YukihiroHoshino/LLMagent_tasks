Given Parent_B’s preferences rank Nursery_B second (after A) and Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last, Parent_E is unlikely to apply to me; Parent_B might if not accepted by Nursery_A. Still, I must respond now with ACCEPT/REJECT. Accepting Parent_C secures a relatively high-priority match (3rd) and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority parent (D or A) or remaining unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply.

However, those top choices may reject them due to nursery priorities (e.g., Nursery_A prefers E,D,A,B,C; Nursery_B prefers E,B,C,D,A).

Since I have quota 1 and can only accept one, I should not accept a lower-priority applicant (Parent_D) when my top-priority applicant (Parent_A) is actively applying now. Rejecting Parent_D preserves the spot for Parent_A, which maximizes my outcome. There is no prior commitment to Parent_D, and accepting them would block my best available match."
