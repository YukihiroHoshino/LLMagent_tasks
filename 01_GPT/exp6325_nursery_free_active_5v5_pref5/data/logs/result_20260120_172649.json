While Parent_E and Parent_B are ranked above Parent_C, they have not applied this round; Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C and Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A, so they may never reach me. Given the rules (an [ACCEPT] forms an immediate match and removes me from the market), the best available option now is to secure Parent_C rather than risk ending up with a lower-ranked parent or unfilled seat."
