Given the market, higher-priority candidates (Parent_E and Parent_D) are likely to apply elsewhere first (E’s top choices are Nursery_C/D; D’s top choices are Nursery_B/C), so they may never reach Nursery_A. However, accepting Parent_B now would forfeit any chance to take Parent_A (ranked above B) if Parent_A later applies to Nursery_A after being rejected by B/C. Parent_A’s top choices are Nursery_B/C, so a later fallback to Nursery_A is plausible. With quota 1 and no ability to “hold” offers, the safer strategy to maximize match quality is to reject Parent_B now and keep the seat available for higher-priority applicants (E, D, or A)."
