No application from Parent_E (#1) or Parent_B (#2) yet. Given our quota is 1, accepting Parent_C now would lock in a decent match but could forgo a higher-priority Parent_E/Parent_B if they apply later. However, Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last, so is unlikely to apply here early (or at all). Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second, but will likely apply to Nursery_A first (their top choice). Nursery_A’s top priorities are Parent_E then Parent_D then Parent_A then Parent_B, so Parent_B may be rejected by Nursery_A and could come to us in a later round. Still, there is uncertainty and we already have a strong, immediate applicant in Parent_C who ranks us first, reducing risk of losing them. Compared to other current applicants, Parent_C is the best available. Therefore, accept Parent_C now to secure a high-priority match rather than gamble on Parent_B later."

Parent_C and Parent_D both rank Nursery_B first and Nursery_C second, and Nursery_B ranks them relatively high, so they may match with Nursery_B and never reach Nursery_C. Parent_E ranks Nursery_C first and is ready to commit, providing a guaranteed fill now. With only one round elapsed and no other applicants yet, the key tradeoff is holding the seat for a possible higher-priority Parent_B versus securing a certain match with Parent_E. Because Parent_B has multiple higher-preference options and may still secure a seat elsewhere, the probability of losing the seat by waiting is material. Accepting Parent_E now yields a stable, committed match and avoids ending unmatched."

Accepting Parent_B now would lock in the lowest-priority match and foreclose the chance to match with any higher-priority parent who might approach in rounds 26–30. Since Nursery_D prefers waiting to preserve the option value for higher-priority parents and has consistently held this stance throughout the history, the optimal strategy remains to reject Parent_B’s application and continue holding the seat for higher-priority families."
