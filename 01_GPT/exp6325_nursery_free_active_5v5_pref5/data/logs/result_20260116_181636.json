If I accept C now, I fill my only seat and lose the chance to take E or B if they apply later. However, I can only respond once to Parent_C now and must choose accept/reject. Given C is ranked above D and A, but below E and B, the key question is likelihood E or B will come. Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C (not us), so E is unlikely to apply to us early. Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A, so B may also not apply to us unless rejected there. To avoid ending up with a lower-ranked match (D/A) if C goes elsewhere, accepting C now secures a relatively high-priority candidate (3rd) with strong commitment. Therefore accept Parent_C."
