To maximize my chance of ending up as high as possible on my true list, I should apply to my second choice Nursery_C where I still have a chance: Nursery_C’s priority ranks me last as well, but fewer parents have Nursery_C as their first choice (only Parent_E), so I may survive competition if Parent_E goes for Nursery_C and is taken elsewhere or chooses differently.
