Given other parents’ preferences, Parent_B prefers A then B then C; Parent_C prefers B then C; Parent_D prefers B then C. Nursery_B’s top priorities include Parent_E and Parent_B/C, so B may attract and accept some of them first; Nursery_A tops Parent_E; Nursery_C is top for Parent_E. Since no higher-priority applicants (B/C/D) contacted us this round, and early acceptance locks us out of potentially better matches, the strategic move is to reject now to keep the seat available for higher-priority parents who may apply to us after being rejected/filled elsewhere. Risk: we may end unmatched if B/C/D never come, but with quota 1 and multiple parents listing C as 2nd/3rd, chances are reasonable."

Given early round (2) and the likelihood higher-priority parents will continue applying down their lists after rejections elsewhere (many initially prefer B/C/A), it is better to reject Parent_E now to preserve the seat for a higher-ranked candidate."
