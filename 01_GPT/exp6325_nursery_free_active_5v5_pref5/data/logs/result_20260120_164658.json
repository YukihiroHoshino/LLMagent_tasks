Given Parent_B lists Nursery_A as their 1st choice, accepting would secure a match, but it risks forgoing higher-priority candidates (E/D/A) who may apply in later rounds. From parents' preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after C,D), Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after B,C), Parent_A ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after B,C). Those higher-priority parents are likely to first approach other nurseries, but could come to Nursery_A if rejected elsewhere. Still, there is no guarantee they will apply to me, and delaying could leave my seat unfilled if they match elsewhere. Balancing certainty vs priority, I will reject now to preserve the chance of matching with a higher-priority parent, since it is early (round 1) and my top candidates have plausible paths to reach me."

However, I should consider the broader market: Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second (after Nursery_A) and Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last, so Parent_E is very unlikely to apply here. Parent_B may apply to Nursery_A first; if rejected there, they could come to me later. If I accept Parent_C now, I secure a relatively high-priority match but lose the chance to upgrade to Parent_B if they become available. Given the one-shot per round constraint and that Parent_C states they will accept immediately, but Parent_B is plausibly attainable in later rounds, the optimal strategy to maximize my match quality is to keep the seat open for Parent_B and reject Parent_C now, since I prefer leaving unfilled over a lower-ranked match than the best feasible option."
