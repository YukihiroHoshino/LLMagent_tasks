Parent_C will likely be accepted by Nursery_B (B ranks C 3rd) unless B gets Parent_E or Parent_B; Parent_D also targets B/C but is lower at B. There is a material chance that Parent_B or Parent_C will later apply to Nursery_C if rejected elsewhere, and they are higher priority for us than Parent_E.
