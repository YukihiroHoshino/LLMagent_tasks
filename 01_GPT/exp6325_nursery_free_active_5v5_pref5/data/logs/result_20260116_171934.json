However, Parent_E (our top choice) and Parent_B (second) have not applied this round. Parent_E’s preferences place Nursery_B last, so they are very unlikely to approach us; Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second and may apply if not accepted by Nursery_A. Accepting Parent_C now would secure a relatively high-priority match and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-priority applicant later, though it forecloses the possibility of upgrading to Parent_B if they later apply. Given Parent_C is our #3 and is explicitly committing, and Parent_E is unlikely, the safe strategy to maximize expected outcome is to accept Parent_C now."
