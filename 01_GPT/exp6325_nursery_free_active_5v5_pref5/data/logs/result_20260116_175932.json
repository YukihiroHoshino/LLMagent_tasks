However, since quota is 1 and accepting now would prevent matching with higher-priority Parent_E or Parent_B, I should consider likelihood they apply to me. Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A (then Nursery_B), and Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C (Nursery_B is last), so Parent_E is very unlikely to apply to me. Parent_B could come to me if rejected by Nursery_A, but Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_E then Parent_D then Parent_A then Parent_B, so Parent_B may indeed be rejected there and could apply to me later. Still, that is uncertain and delaying risks losing Parent_C (who has me as first choice) to another nursery if I reject.
