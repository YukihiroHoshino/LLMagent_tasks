Given the overall preferences: Parent_B prefers Nursery_A then B then C; Parent_C prefers B then C; Parent_D prefers B then C; Parent_A prefers B then C; Parent_E prefers C first. Competition: Nursery_B and Nursery_A are strong magnets. Parent_B is top priority for us but may be taken by Nursery_A or B; Parent_C likely targets B first; Parent_D targets B first; however, there is still a reasonable chance one of B/C/D comes to us in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Since we are early (round 1) and only have one offer from a 4th-choice candidate, it is strategically better to reject now to preserve the slot for higher-priority candidates."
