Given the market-wide preferences, Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may apply elsewhere first (Nursery_C/D), and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after B/C). There is a reasonable chance higher-priority parents may not come to Nursery_A immediately, but they could later if rejected elsewhere. With 30 rounds and only round 1, it is strategically better to keep the seat open for a higher-priority parent rather than commit now to a lower-ranked one, since we prefer a higher-ranked match and can still accept Parent_B later if they re-apply and the seat remains open."

Parent_A also signals Nursery_E is their highest remaining choice and will commit immediately, reducing risk of losing them.
