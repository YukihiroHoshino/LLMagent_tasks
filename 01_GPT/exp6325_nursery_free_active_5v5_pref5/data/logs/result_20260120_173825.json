In this round, A, D, and E all applied; accepting Parent_E yields the best possible match for Nursery_A within quota 1. Although Parent_E lists Nursery_A as third choice, they explicitly state they would be very happy to enroll and can confirm immediately, reducing risk of declination. Given quota is available and this is the top-ranked candidate, accept now rather than holding out for a lower-priority parent."

Waiting could, in principle, yield Parent_D or Parent_A, but both rank Nursery_D last and are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere, and delaying risks ending unmatched.

Nursery_E ranks Parent_A first in its priority list and is still available, so applying now maximizes my chance of securing a match while staying within my preference list (Nursery_E is my 4th choice and preferable to going unmatched).
