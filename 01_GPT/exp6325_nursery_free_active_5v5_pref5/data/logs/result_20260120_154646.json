In this round I received APPLY from B, A, D, C. Parent_B is the highest-ranked among current applicants. While Parent_E is my top choice, Parent_E’s preferences place Nursery_B last, so it is very unlikely Parent_E will apply to me (they will likely pursue Nursery_C/D/A/E before B). Waiting risks losing Parent_B to Nursery_A (Parent_B’s 1st choice) if they apply there next and get accepted.
