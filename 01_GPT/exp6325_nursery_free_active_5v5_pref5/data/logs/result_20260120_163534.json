However, Parent_E/D/A all prefer B/C above us and may apply there first; Parent_B applying now provides a secure match. Given the one-shot accept/reject on APPLY and no ability to hold, accepting Parent_B guarantees filling the seat, but risks missing a higher-priority parent if they later apply. Considering competition: Nursery_B prioritizes E then B; Nursery_C prioritizes B first; so Parent_E likely gets attention at B, Parent_D at B/C, Parent_A at B/C. Probability of higher-priority parents applying to us soon seems moderate-to-low. To avoid ending unmatched, accept Parent_B now."

Since we have quota 1, accepting Parent_E now would block us from matching with B/C/D if they later apply. In this protocol we cannot 'hold' an application—must accept or reject.
