I still have quota 1 and no other applicants in the inbox this round, but accepting Parent_E now would prevent me from matching with any higher-priority parent if they approach later. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and I have consistently rejected while indicating we are holding for higher-priority families; to stay consistent and maximize my objective (match as high as possible), I should continue to reject until the stated internal deadline is reached and higher-priority options are resolved. Since Parent_E applied, I must choose ACCEPT/REJECT; I will REJECT while reaffirming the deadline and inviting them to check back next round."

Given the long delay and no evidence that higher-priority parents (Parent_D/Parent_A/Parent_C) are actively pursuing Nursery_D—indeed, in their preferences Nursery_D is low (D ranks it last; A ranks it last; C ranks it 3rd)—continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched. Parent_E ranks Nursery_D as 2nd choice, so acceptance is likely to finalize immediately and secure a match. Therefore accept Parent_E now."
