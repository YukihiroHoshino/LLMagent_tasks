Since my quota is 1, accepting Parent_D now would block me from accepting the higher-priority Parent_C who is already applying and states strong commitment. Although Parent_E is my top choice, they did not contact me this round and they rank Nursery_B last, so waiting specifically for E is risky.

The best among these is Parent_C. However, Parent_E (our top) is not in the inbox and Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last, so they are unlikely to apply here. Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second and may apply if rejected by Nursery_A; risk exists that Parent_B could arrive later and is higher priority than Parent_C. But accepting Parent_C now secures a high-priority match (3rd) with a parent who states strong commitment, avoiding the chance of ending up with a lower-priority parent or remaining unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply.
