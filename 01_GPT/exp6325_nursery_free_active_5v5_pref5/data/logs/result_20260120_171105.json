Parent_B ranks Nursery_B 2nd and may apply if not accepted by Nursery_A (their 1st). Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_E first, so Parent_B might be rejected there and then come to me. Therefore, I should reject Parent_C now to keep the slot open for Parent_B, while also rejecting lower-priority applicants separately.

Checking parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_A ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 3rd; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 2nd. So Parent_E is relatively likely to commit if accepted, while higher-priority Parent_D/Parent_A are unlikely to apply.

In this round, I received APPLY messages from Parent_A and Parent_D. Between them, Parent_D is higher on my priority list, so accepting Parent_D is better than accepting Parent_A. Waiting for Parent_E is risky because Parent_E ranks Nursery_A third (after Nursery_C and Nursery_D) and may never apply here; meanwhile I have a high-priority candidate (Parent_D) applying now. I previously rejected Parent_A and Parent_B, and accepting Parent_D now secures a strong match within my quota."
