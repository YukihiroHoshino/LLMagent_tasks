Given the market: Parent_B’s top choices are Nursery_A then Nursery_B, so they may not come to us early; Parent_C and Parent_D both rank Nursery_C as 2nd after Nursery_B, so if they fail at Nursery_B they are likely to apply to us soon. Since our quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now could block a higher-priority match (Parent_C or Parent_D) that is plausibly available in early rounds.
