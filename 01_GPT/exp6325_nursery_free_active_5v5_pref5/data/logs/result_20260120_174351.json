Check parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_A ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 3rd; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 2nd. So the main realistic higher-priority candidate is Parent_C (and possibly Parent_B, though low priority for us). Given Parent_E’s strong interest (2nd choice) and immediate commitment, but uncertainty about Parent_C applying, it is still rational to wait for at least another round to try for Parent_C, since accepting Parent_E now prevents improvement.
