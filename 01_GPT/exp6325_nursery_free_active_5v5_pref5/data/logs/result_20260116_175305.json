Check their preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may first apply to Nursery_C then Nursery_D; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may first apply to Nursery_B then Nursery_C. So there is a meaningful chance higher-priority parents will not come immediately in round 1 but could come in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Since we can only respond [ACCEPT]/[REJECT] to an [APPLY] and cannot hold, the strategic choice to maximize our match quality is to reject Parent_B now to keep capacity for E/D/A. Risk: we may end unmatched if none apply later, but given A is 3rd choice for multiple parents, some probability of receiving applications later is reasonable."

Given the market: Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A (but Nursery_A ranks Parent_E highest), Parent_C’s top is Nursery_B, Parent_D’s top is Nursery_B, and Parent_A’s top is Nursery_B. Nursery_B ranks Parent_E highest and is many parents’ first choice, so Parent_E may be pulled away if not secured here, but Parent_E is already applying to us. To maximize chance of matching with a higher-priority parent, it is better to hold the seat for now and reject Parent_E, since Parent_C and Parent_D are likely to apply to Nursery_C as their 2nd choice after Nursery_B, and Parent_B may apply later if Nursery_A/B don’t work out.

However, Parent_B and Parent_E (both ranked above Parent_C) have not applied yet. Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last, so it is very unlikely they will apply to me early (or at all). Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second after Nursery_A, so Parent_B may apply to Nursery_A first and only come to me if rejected there; Nursery_A’s top priorities are Parent_E and Parent_D, so Parent_B is not highly prioritized and could be rejected, making a later Parent_B application to me plausible. If I accept Parent_C now, I lock in a match and forego the chance to get Parent_B later, which would be better for me. Since I have no mechanism to ‘hold’ offers and later switch, the optimal strategy is to reject Parent_C now to preserve the slot for a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_B), accepting the risk of ending unmatched. Given Parent_E’s low likelihood and uncertainty about Parent_B, this is a calculated risk but aligned with the objective to match as high as possible on my true priority list."
