If I accept Parent_B now, I foreclose the possibility of matching with higher-priority Parent_E or Parent_D.

Given Nursery_E’s priority list places me last, I should still apply clearly and credibly, emphasizing immediate acceptance and readiness to complete paperwork to reduce any uncertainty and potentially win out if others hesitate."
