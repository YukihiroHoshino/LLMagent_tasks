Parent_C’s top choice is Nursery_B; Nursery_B ranks Parent_C 3rd but will likely take Parent_E (its 1st) if available; Parent_E is currently applying to us, not Nursery_B. Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_B and is ranked 4th there, so less likely to land at Nursery_B if higher-ranked applicants apply. Parent_A also prefers Nursery_B first. Since our quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now could block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Parent_C or Parent_D if they later apply to us (we are their 2nd choice).
