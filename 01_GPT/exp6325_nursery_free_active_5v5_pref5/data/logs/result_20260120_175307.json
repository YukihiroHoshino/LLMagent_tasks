Parent_B ranks Nursery_B second (after Nursery_A) and may apply later if not accepted by Nursery_A; Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last and is unlikely to apply. Since accepting Parent_C now would finalize the match and prevent upgrading, it is strategically better to reject now and keep capacity available to potentially match with Parent_B.

Accepting Parent_A immediately secures the best possible outcome for me; waiting risks losing them to higher-ranked nurseries on their preference list (B, C, A are all above E for them) or ending up with a lower-priority parent. Since Parent_A has applied and can confirm immediately, accepting now is optimal."
