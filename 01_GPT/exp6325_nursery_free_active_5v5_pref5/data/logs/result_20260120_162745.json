Waiting risks losing the seat to a later, higher-priority applicant, but there is no guarantee that Parent_B/Parent_C/Parent_D will apply to Nursery_C soon (they all rank Nursery_B first; Parent_B also ranks Nursery_A first). Given the one-seat quota and the concrete, ready-to-enroll application from Parent_E, accept to avoid ending unmatched."
