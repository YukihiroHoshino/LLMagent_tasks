At this time, we’re still not able to extend an offer, as we must keep the remaining place available while we continue allocation in line with our priority order.\n\nIn terms of what we typically require once an offer is made, it is usually: (1) a completed enrollment form, (2) proof of identity/child details (as applicable), (3) any required health/immunization documentation, and (4) payment of any required deposit/fees by the stated deadline. However, we can only confirm the exact items, amounts, and deadlines at the point an offer is issued.\n\nThank you again for your patience and understanding.\n",

Accepting now would lock in a lower-priority match and remove the chance to match with higher-priority parents (A/C/B) if they approach in later rounds. History shows repeated applications from Parent_E; we have consistently rejected to hold for higher-priority families, and we should remain consistent with that strategy given we are still unmatched and have not yet exhausted rounds (current round 12 of 30). Therefore, reject again while giving minimal, non-committal guidance about typical enrollment items without implying an offer."

If you can’t offer the place today, could you please let me know (a) whether you expect to be able to finalize the seat this round, and (b) what the next decision point/date is when you will know if the seat can be offered to the next family?

However, by revealed preferences, Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_E 4th and are likely to match earlier with B/C/A; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E 4th. Given we are already in round 13 with no higher-priority applicants approaching, the probability of attracting A/C/B later seems low. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched.
