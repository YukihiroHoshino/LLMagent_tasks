Since better-priority candidates (Parent_C/Parent_D) are plausibly reachable soon, accepting Parent_E now would block a higher-priority match.

There is a possibility of receiving Parent_E or Parent_B later, but Parent_E prefers Nursery_C first and Parent_B prefers Nursery_A first, so neither is guaranteed to apply to me soon.
