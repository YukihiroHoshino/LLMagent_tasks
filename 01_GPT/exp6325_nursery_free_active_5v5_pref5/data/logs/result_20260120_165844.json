There is a meaningful chance a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_D, possibly Parent_C) comes to us in a subsequent round if rejected elsewhere.

Parent_B (my 2nd choice) prefers Nursery_A first and may go there; A prioritizes E > D > A > B > C, so B is 4th and could be rejected and then apply to me. If I accept Parent_C now, I forgo the chance to match with Parent_E or Parent_B later. But holding the seat is not allowed without accepting/rejecting, and rejecting Parent_C risks ending up with Parent_D or Parent_A (both lower) or possibly no one if E/B never come.
