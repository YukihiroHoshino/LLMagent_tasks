Given full information, Parent_E and Parent_D both rank Nursery_A as their 3rd choice and will likely apply elsewhere first (E to C, then D; D to B, then C). However, there is a realistic path that they do not secure their higher choices due to competition (e.g., Parent_E faces strong competition at Nursery_C where Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_B first; Parent_D faces competition at Nursery_B where Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_E first). Since my quota is 1, accepting Parent_B now would lock me into a lower-priority match and foreclose the chance to later accept Parent_E or Parent_D if they come to me in subsequent rounds.
