However, Parent_B (2nd) prefers Nursery_A first and may apply to me if rejected there; Parent_E (1st) ranks me last and is unlikely to apply. With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now would secure a relatively high-priority match and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-priority parent (D or A) or remaining unmatched if Parent_B never comes.
