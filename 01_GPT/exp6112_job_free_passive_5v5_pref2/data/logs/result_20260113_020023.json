              "message": "[TALK] Hi Seeker_B—thanks for reaching out. Happy to be concrete, and if this aligns, we’d love for you to apply quickly.\n\n(1) Top outcomes in the first 60–90 days (what “great” looks like):\n• Own and ship one meaningful end-to-end deliverable: take an ambiguous problem, align stakeholders on scope/success metrics, execute, and deliver a measurable result (or a clear production-ready handoff) by ~8–12 weeks.\n• Create clarity + operating rhythm: establish a lightweight plan, write crisp updates/docs, and build trust with cross-functional partners so execution becomes predictable (fewer surprises, faster decisions).\n\n(2) Profile that tends to do best in our process:\n• Strong problem framing and prioritization (you can explain what matters, what doesn’t, and why).\n• Evidence of ownership: you’ve driven work from ambiguity to delivery, proactively de-risked, and followed through.\n• Clear written + verbal communication (structured thinking, concise stakeholder updates).\n• Practical execution mindset: you can balance speed and quality, and you’re comfortable making tradeoffs.\n\nIf you’re open to it, share 1–2 examples of (a) a project you owned end-to-end and (b) a time you improved a process/metric. If those map well, I’d encourage you to submit an application this round—we can move quickly on next steps.",
              "thought": "Seeker_B is Company_A’s top priority (#1). They are currently unmatched and only talking. I should respond with [TALK], provide clear 60–90 day outcomes and interview success profile, and actively encourage them to apply quickly. Given Seeker_B ranks Company_A last, I need to differentiate and reduce their uncertainty to convert them to apply before they match elsewhere (notably Company_C where they are also highly prioritized). Keep message compelling and concrete, and ask for a quick follow-up to confirm fit and timing."

Quick follow-ups so I can decide whether to submit a formal application: (1) Are you currently prioritizing any candidates (or expecting an offer decision) in the next round or two? (2) If I applied, what would be the immediate next step and decision timeline? I’m very interested in roles where I can ramp fast and deliver measurable impact in the first 60–90 days. [TALK]",

Given Company_C’s priority list (B>A>D>E>C), I’m mid-ranked (#3) and could be considered if top choices go elsewhere. With Company_E and Company_D already off the table this round (not available), and uncertainty about my pending status with Company_B, I should keep Company_C warm and gather signal on likelihood/timeline rather than applying immediately."

That said, we haven’t finalized anything yet, and we’re still open to speaking with and considering additional applicants.\n\n2) **If you applied—next step + timeline:** The immediate next step would be a short **screen/intro** (to confirm scope fit and align on what you’d own in the first 60–90 days). If that goes well, we’d move quickly into the main interview loop. From application to a decision, we typically aim for **~1–2 rounds** (often about **1–2 weeks**, faster if schedules align).\n\nGiven your focus on ramping fast and delivering measurable impact, your profile sounds aligned with what we need. If you’re interested, I’d encourage you to submit the formal application soon so we can get you into the next steps.\n\nOne quick question so we can move at the right pace: **what’s your decision timeline and are you currently in late stages with any other companies?**",

Seeker_B ranks us #2 and may be contested by Company_E (their #1) and others; we should keep flexibility to accept Seeker_B if they apply. With Seeker_D currently only talking, we should keep them warm and encourage a timely application while not committing or signaling an imminent offer. Provide clear next steps and timeline, and ask about their decision deadline to manage sequencing."
