Here’s what we’re prioritizing most right now and what would make someone our clear first choice.\n\n**Top priorities (skills/experience):**\n1) **Ownership + execution in ambiguity**: you’ve taken a loosely defined problem, set a plan/metrics, and delivered a measurable result.\n2) **Clear communication + stakeholder management**: concise updates, good judgment on tradeoffs, and ability to align cross-functional partners.\n\n**Must-haves:**\n- A concrete end-to-end example with **scope, your decisions/tradeoffs, and measurable impact** (numbers preferred; a strong proxy metric is fine).\n- Comfort operating with imperfect information and driving to a decision.\n\n**Start timeline:** We’re hiring now and can move quickly—typically **~1–2 weeks** from initial conversation to decision for strong fits.\n\n**What makes a candidate our clear first choice right now:**\n- One standout story where you **defined success metrics**, drove execution end-to-end, and can point to a clear **before/after impact**.\n- Evidence you can manage stakeholders without losing velocity (what you deprioritized and why).\n\nIf you want to align your application, send a **3–5 sentence** summary of your best ownership example including: (a) the problem, (b) your approach, (c) key stakeholders, (d) metric moved/results, and (e) what you’d do differently in hindsight. I’ll tell you quickly if it maps to what we need and what to emphasize next.",

Seeker_E ranks us 3rd, so they may apply if encouraged. However, higher-priority seekers (A and C) may be attainable: Seeker_C ranks us #1; Seeker_A ranks us #3. We should keep Seeker_E warm by sharing criteria/timeline and requesting a concrete ownership example, but not push to immediate apply/accept until we see whether higher-priority matches materialize."
