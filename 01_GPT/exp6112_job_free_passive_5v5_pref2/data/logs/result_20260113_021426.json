              "thought": "Company_A is my #2 choice (very desirable). I should signal strong interest early. Company_A’s priority ranks me #2 (behind Seeker_B), so I have a decent chance if I apply now. However, Seeker_B ranks Company_A last, so they’re unlikely to apply there; that increases my acceptance chances. Since there is no cost to applying besides using this one exchange, I should apply immediately rather than just talk."

              "thought": "Seeker_D is #2 on Company_A’s true priority list (only behind Seeker_B) and has proactively applied to us in round 1. With quota 1, accepting now secures a highly preferred candidate and avoids the risk that Seeker_B matches elsewhere (Seeker_B ranks Company_A last and is likely to accept offers from Company_E/Company_C first). No prior commitments exist, so accepting is optimal."

Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 and may be attainable; Seeker_A ranks us last and is unlikely. With no prior rounds and only one quota, accepting Seeker_E now could block a higher-priority match, but rejecting risks ending unmatched if Seeker_B goes elsewhere (Company_E is Seeker_B’s #1 and may accept). Given Seeker_E ranks us #1 and is applying now, securing a solid match is prudent in round 1."
