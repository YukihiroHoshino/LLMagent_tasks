If you have competing timelines, we can often compress to ~7–10 days.\n\nIf this aligns, I’d encourage you to submit a formal application this round so we can start scheduling. One quick question to ensure fit: what are the 2–3 criteria that will determine your decision (e.g., scope, autonomy, mentorship, domain, pace), and do you have any deadlines from other processes?",
