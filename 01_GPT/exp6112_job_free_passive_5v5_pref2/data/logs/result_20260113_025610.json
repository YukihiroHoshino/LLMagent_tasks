Happy to share what we optimize for and what “strong” looks like here.\n\n**What we value most in candidates**\n- **Ownership + follow-through:** you take ambiguous problems, propose a plan, and drive it to a measurable outcome.\n- **Structured thinking:** clear prioritization, crisp communication, and sensible tradeoffs.\n- **Collaboration:** you can influence without authority and work well across functions.\n- **Learning velocity:** you ramp quickly and incorporate feedback.\n\n**Top priorities for the first 90 days**\n- **Weeks 1–2:** ramp on the product/business, stakeholders, and current metrics; understand the current roadmap and pain points.\n- **Weeks 3–6:** take ownership of a well-scoped initiative and deliver an initial improvement (process, analysis, or feature/workstream—depending on the role track).\n- **Weeks 7–12:** lead a higher-impact project end-to-end with clear success metrics and stakeholder alignment.\n\n**What makes an applicant stand out**\n- A **specific portfolio of outcomes** (what you did, how you measured success, and what changed).\n- Evidence of **prioritization under constraints** (time, data, resources).\n- A short, tailored note on **why Company_B** and what you’d aim to accomplish in your first 60–90 days.\n\nTo help me guide you best: what kinds of roles are you targeting (and what are 1–2 achievements you’re most proud of that map to this role)?
