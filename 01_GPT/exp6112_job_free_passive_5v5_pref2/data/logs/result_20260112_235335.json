For this opening at Company_B, we value: (1) strong ownership and follow-through (taking ambiguous problems to shipped outcomes), (2) clear written and verbal communication with stakeholders, (3) analytical rigor (using data to prioritize and measure impact), and (4) collaboration—especially when tradeoffs are real.\n\nFirst 60–90 days typically look like:\n• Days 1–30: onboarding + context. You’ll meet key partners, learn our product/processes, and take ownership of a well-scoped starter project. Success = ramp quickly, ask great questions, and deliver a first measurable improvement.\n• Days 31–60: lead a core project end-to-end. Success = define scope/metrics, align stakeholders, execute, and report results.\n• Days 61–90: expand ownership. Success = independently drive a higher-impact initiative, identify 1–2 roadmap opportunities, and set a repeatable operating cadence.\n\nTo make this concrete: we usually expect a clear project plan (milestones/risks), a simple KPI dashboard or success metric definition, and a post-launch readout by ~day 60–90.\n\nA couple quick questions to understand fit: what kind of problems energize you most (0→1 building, scaling/optimization, or cross-functional coordination), and what’s an example of a project where you defined success metrics and drove alignment across multiple stakeholders?",
