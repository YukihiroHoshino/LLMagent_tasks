The immediate goal is to (a) map the current flow end-to-end, (b) surface the top 2–3 bottlenecks with evidence (cycle time, defect/quality signals, stakeholder pain), and (c) drive a concrete fix that ships—either a process change, a scoped deliverable, or a small product/ops improvement—so stakeholders feel the difference quickly.\n\n(2) Profiles that tend to succeed here (strengths + working style):\n- High ownership: comfortable taking an ambiguous problem, proposing a plan, and executing without heavy supervision.\n- Crisp, proactive communication: short, regular updates; flags risks early; brings options and a recommendation.\n- Strong prioritization: focuses on the few things that move outcomes, not just activity.\n- Collaborative but decisive: aligns stakeholders, then drives to a decision and follows through.\n- Iterative “ship and improve” mindset: delivers something measurable early, then tightens the loop.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to calibrate fit quickly: what’s one example of a measurable win you delivered in your first 30–60 days on a new team, and what metrics/outcome did you move?",
