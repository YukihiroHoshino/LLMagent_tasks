Domain/stack familiarity is a plus, but not the deciding factor if you can ramp quickly.\n\nSingle most important 60–90 day deliverable:\n- Own and ship one meaningful, cross-functional project from definition → execution → rollout, with measurable impact (e.g., a key workflow improvement, a reliability/quality initiative, or a customer-facing enhancement). Success looks like: clear problem statement + metrics, an aligned plan, on-time delivery, and a post-launch readout with results and next steps.\n\nThe “gap” we’re trying to fill:\n- Someone who can be the driver on a messy initiative—create clarity, make tradeoffs, and keep stakeholders aligned while still delivering high-quality output.\n\nTo quickly confirm fit before you apply, could you reply with:\n1) One most comparable end-to-end project you led (scope, stakeholders, timeline).\n2) The measurable outcomes (metrics before/after, or concrete results).\n3) Where the ambiguity was and how you structured it.\n4) Timing: if things look aligned, would you be ready to submit an application to Company_A in the next round or two, or are you still prioritizing other companies first?",
