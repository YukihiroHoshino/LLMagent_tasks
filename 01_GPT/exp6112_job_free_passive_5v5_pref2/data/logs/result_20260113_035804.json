That said, we can move very quickly (same-round / next-step fast) if what you share lines up.\n\n(2) Where you stand: you’re in our top tier/shortlist for the single opening—not a finalized “top choice locked” yet, but absolutely one of the few we’re actively considering.\n\nIf you’re willing, please send that concise fit summary tailored to the first 60–90 days—ideally:\n- 1 example of owning an ambiguous project end-to-end (goal/metrics → key tradeoff → shipped outcome),\n- how you run stakeholder cadence (written updates / alignment),\n- one process/workflow improvement you drove with measurable impact.\n\nIf that lands strongly, I’m comfortable moving straight to an [APPLY] conversation immediately after and making a fast decision.",

I should keep Seeker_A engaged and try to elicit an [APPLY] without overcommitting, since I can likely secure Seeker_E if needed.
