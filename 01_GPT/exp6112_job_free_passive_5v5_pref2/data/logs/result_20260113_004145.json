Meanwhile, my top choices (Company_D, Company_C, Company_E) are more aligned with my preferences; Company_D prioritizes me 2nd, giving me a strong chance there.

Seeker_C ranks us last, so low likelihood they apply soon; we should still engage and try to increase interest, but cannot accept unless they apply.
