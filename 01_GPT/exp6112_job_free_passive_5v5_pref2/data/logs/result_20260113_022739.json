I’d like to move forward and formally apply this round.\n\nIf selected, I can ramp quickly in the first 60–90 days by (1) taking clear ownership of a core deliverable end-to-end, (2) setting a tight execution/communication cadence with stakeholders, and (3) driving measurable progress against your top priorities. I’m ready to commit and start contributing immediately.\n\nI’d be excited to join Company_B and appreciate your consideration.",
              "thought": "Company_B is 4th on my true list (C, A, D, B, E). Higher options (C, A) appear likely filled; remaining unmatched are B and D. I already applied to D, but D’s priority ranks me 4th, while B’s priority ranks me 4th as well. Since this is my first chance to formally apply to B and we are late in the process with limited options, I should apply now to keep a viable path to employment rather than risk ending unmatched if D rejects."

We’ll use that to align your initial 60–90 day plan and hit the ground running.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_C and Seeker_E remain unmatched. Our true priority ranks Seeker_E ahead of Seeker_D but behind A/B/C. Seeker_A and Seeker_B are already unavailable (not in remaining list), leaving Seeker_C as the only higher-priority alternative. However, Seeker_C ranks Company_B last, so the probability of securing Seeker_C is low, while Seeker_E ranks us 4th but is applying now. Accepting Seeker_E secures a match with a candidate still on our priority list and avoids the risk of ending unmatched."
