Happy to share what we value and how we assess early success.\n\nWhat stands out most for us:\n- Clear ownership: you can take an ambiguous problem, define scope, and drive it to completion with minimal hand-holding.\n- Strong execution habits: prioritization, reliable delivery, and crisp communication of tradeoffs/risks.\n- Collaboration: partnering well with cross-functional stakeholders and incorporating feedback quickly.\n- Learning speed: ramping on our domain/tools fast and turning that into measurable outcomes.\n\nHow success is typically measured in the first 3–6 months:\n- 0–30 days: onboarding completed, understands the product/team workflows, and can independently handle smaller tasks/tickets.\n- 30–90 days: owns a meaningful project or area, delivers at least one solid release/initiative, and communicates progress proactively.\n- 90–180 days: demonstrates sustained impact—improves a metric, reduces operational burden, or materially upgrades a process/system.\n\nTo tailor this: what role/function are you targeting with us, and can you share 1–2 examples of projects where you defined the problem, aligned stakeholders, and delivered measurable results? Also, what are your top 1–2 criteria for choosing among companies?",

Although holding out could yield Seeker_E or Seeker_B, there is meaningful risk they match elsewhere (both also rank Company_E highly but face competition).

Waiting could risk losing out if Seeker_B/Seeker_A/Seeker_D match elsewhere (notably Seeker_B ranks Company_C 2nd behind Company_E).

It would be premature to apply in round 1 since I have strong chances at higher choices: Company_E ranks me #2, and Company_C ranks me #1.
