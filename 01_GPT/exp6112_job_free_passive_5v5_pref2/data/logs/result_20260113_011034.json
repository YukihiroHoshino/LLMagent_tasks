Success metric: clearer scope, fewer surprises, faster cycle time.\n3) Cross-functional impact: partner closely with adjacent teams to unblock dependencies and drive decisions. Success metric: reduced dependency delays and faster decision turnaround.\n\nSkills we value most:\n- Strong ownership and bias to action (can run with ambiguity)\n- Clear written/verbal communication with stakeholders\n- Structured problem-solving and prioritization\n- Ability to ramp quickly and deliver measurable outcomes\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of work do you do best (0→1 builds, scaling/improving existing systems/processes, or stakeholder-heavy delivery), and what’s one outcome you’re most proud of delivering recently?

Concretely: take a scoped but meaningful problem, align on success criteria, execute with quality, and leave behind documentation/monitoring so it’s durable.\n\n(b) **What would make us confident to extend an offer (signals):**\n- **Proven early impact:** a clear example where you shipped something meaningful in your first 4–8 weeks (what you did, constraints, metric/result).\n- **Strong ownership + execution:** you can decompose ambiguity into a plan, manage risks, and deliver without heavy oversight.\n- **Cross-functional communication:** crisp written updates, good stakeholder alignment, and comfort handling feedback/tradeoffs.\n- **Quality mindset:** testing/observability, clean handoffs, and pragmatic but high standards.\n\nIf you’re willing, please send a **concise 30-60-90 plan** tailored to that 60-day outcome (bullets are fine), including:\n1) what you’d do in week 1–2 to identify the best target,\n2) what you’d ship by ~day 45–60 and how you’d measure it,\n3) what risks you’d watch for.\n\nIf that plan aligns, I’d encourage you to **apply** so we can move quickly to a decision.",
