Based on what I’m looking for (clear ownership early and measurable outcomes), I’m very interested in moving forward and would like to formally apply.

Also, Seeker_E ranks Company_D as #3 (behind C and A), so they may accept another offer if we delay. Given round 3 and need to secure a match within quota, accepting Seeker_E now is a reasonable compromise while still aligned with our priority list."

Seeker_B prefers Company_E first and Company_C second, so they may not apply to Company_A unless rejected elsewhere, giving me a strong chance at Company_A if I apply now. With limited rounds and only one slot per company, it’s optimal to apply to Company_A this round to secure a high-ranked match while Company_E remains uncertain."
