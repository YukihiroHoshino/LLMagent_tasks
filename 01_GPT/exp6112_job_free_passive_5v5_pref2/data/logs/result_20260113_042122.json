Concretely, that usually looks like:\n- **Week 1–2:** map the workflow end-to-end, identify the biggest bottleneck, align stakeholders on a single problem statement + success metric.\n- **Week 3–6:** drive execution to a first release/launch (or a decision-changing analysis), including rollout plan + follow-ups.\n\n**Single biggest trait we’re screening for:** **end-to-end ownership in ambiguity** (not just speed). Specifically: can you frame the problem, align people with different incentives, make tradeoffs, and deliver something real without needing tight direction.\n\nIf you want to align your experience quickly: what’s one example where you (1) had conflicting stakeholder inputs, (2) defined the metric, and (3) shipped a result—what was the outcome?

By ~day 45–60, we’d expect a shipped milestone (or a clear pilot/launch) with an agreed success metric.\n\n(2) What “clearly successful by end of first quarter” looks like:\n- A measurable outcome delivered (e.g., improved a key metric, reduced cycle time/cost, increased adoption/quality—depends on the workstream), with a narrative that shows you drove end-to-end execution.\n- Strong cross-functional operating rhythm: stakeholders know what’s happening, risks are surfaced early, and decisions don’t stall.\n- Evidence you can translate ambiguity into crisp execution: written plan, clear milestones, and data-informed tradeoffs.\n\nRe: where your background might fit—based on what you shared earlier (interest in priorities/fit and how you think about 60–90 day impact), you’re likely strongest if you’ve repeatedly led cross-functional delivery where you had to create structure, align partners, and land outcomes with metrics.
