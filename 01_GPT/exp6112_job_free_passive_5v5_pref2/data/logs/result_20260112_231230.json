With quota 1 and higher-priority seekers (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D, Seeker_E) preferred, accepting Seeker_C now would block a better match. Seeker_B remains unmatched and ranks Company_C as #2, making them a strong potential match; Seeker_E ranks Company_C #1 but was previously rejected and is still in play. Therefore reject Seeker_C to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates."
