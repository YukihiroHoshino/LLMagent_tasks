If you submit an application promptly, we can usually start that process **within 1–2 business days**.\n\n2) **Most prioritized experience right now:** the biggest “yes/no” signal is **end-to-end ownership in ambiguity with measurable impact**—i.e., you identified/defined the problem, aligned stakeholders, made tradeoffs, executed, and shipped something that moved a metric (or clearly improved quality/cost/time).\n\nIf you want to keep momentum, send me **one** strongest example (scope, your role, metric/impact, and cross-functional partners) + your **earliest realistic start date**. If it fits what we need, I’d encourage you to **apply today** and we’ll push to get you into the next step quickly.",
