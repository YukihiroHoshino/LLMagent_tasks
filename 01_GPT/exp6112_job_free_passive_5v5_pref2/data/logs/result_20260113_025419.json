Happy to share more.\n\nRole success factors / key skills:\n- Strong ownership: ability to take a problem from ambiguous requirements to a shipped, measurable outcome.\n- Clear communication and stakeholder management (writing, prioritization tradeoffs, and keeping partners aligned).\n- Analytical rigor: comfort using data to diagnose issues and evaluate impact.\n- Team collaboration: iterate quickly with peers and incorporate feedback.\n\nFirst 90 days (typical expectations):\n- Weeks 1–2: ramp on our domain, tooling, and current priorities; meet key cross-functional partners.\n- Weeks 3–6: take ownership of a well-scoped project and deliver an initial milestone; propose improvements based on what you’re seeing.\n- Weeks 7–12: lead a larger initiative end-to-end, including defining success metrics and presenting results/next steps.\n\nHiring timeline:\n- We’re actively interviewing now. If there’s mutual fit, we aim to complete interviews and make a decision within ~2–3 weeks (often faster depending on scheduling).\n\nA couple quick questions to tailor the conversation:\n1) What type of work are you hoping to do most in your next role (and least)?\n2) What’s your ideal start date and any competing deadlines/offers we should be aware of?\n3) Which of the skills above do you feel is your strongest, and where are you looking to grow?\n\n[TALK]",
