Company_D’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind A, C, D), so my acceptance odds there are moderate-to-low unless higher-priority seekers go elsewhere. Company_C is my #1 but likely very competitive; Company_B is #4. Since we’re in round 3 and D is still available, it’s worth applying now to secure a solid option rather than risk ending up at B/E or unmatched. I previously only talked with D, not applied, so applying is allowed."
