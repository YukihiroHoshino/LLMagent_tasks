With quota 1 and no prior matches, accepting now secures a high-priority candidate; waiting for Seeker_A (#1) is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_D only 3rd and may match elsewhere (e.g., Company_E or Company_B) quickly.

If you’re open to it, I’d like to formally apply and be considered for your open position.",

Company_A’s priority list ranks me 2nd (behind Seeker_B), so I have a strong chance if I apply now, especially before Company_A commits to someone else.

With quota 1, accepting now secures a very high-preference match and avoids the risk of losing Seeker_D to another company (Seeker_D ranks Company_E first and may match elsewhere). While Seeker_B is #1, there is no guarantee we will be paired with Seeker_B soon or win them against competitors. Therefore, accept Seeker_D."
