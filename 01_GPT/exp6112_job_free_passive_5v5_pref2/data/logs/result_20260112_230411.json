The most urgent need is for this hire to **take end-to-end ownership of stabilizing that area**: tighten observability, reduce alert noise, address the top failure modes, and ship 1–2 targeted fixes that measurably reduce pages/incidents.\n\n**(2) What would make us confident to extend an offer quickly**\nWe move fastest when we see:\n- Clear examples of **owning an ambiguous problem end-to-end** (diagnose → plan → ship → measure).\n- Strong **systems debugging + reliability mindset** (instrumentation, incident response, postmortems, safe rollouts).\n- Concise, high-signal communication (tradeoffs, scope control, stakeholder alignment).\nIf you share 2–3 projects, the most helpful format is: *problem → your role → actions/decisions → measurable outcome (latency/availability/cost/on-call reduction) → what you’d do differently.*\n\n**(3) Timeline from here**\nWe’re **not early**—we’re aiming to close soon. If you apply, we can typically complete the loop in **~7–10 days** (sometimes faster) depending on scheduling.\n\nIf you’re open to it: send the 2–3 project summary, and also tell me (a) your rough stage with the other teams (early vs final rounds) and (b) whether you’d be willing to submit an application in the next **48–72 hours** if this still looks aligned.",

Since Seeker_A is only [TALK], respond with specifics, create urgency, and ask for a concise project summary plus a clear application/decision date to gauge seriousness."
