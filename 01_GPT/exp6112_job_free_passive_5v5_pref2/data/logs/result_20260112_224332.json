Domain depth helps, but it’s not the gating factor—good judgment, crisp communication, and strong ownership are.\n\n(2) We’re **still actively evaluating candidates** and having ongoing conversations; we’re not at a fully closed “finalized offer” stage yet.\n\nIf you’re still interested, the best next step is to send a brief note with **one end-to-end project you owned** (problem → approach → outcome/metric) and **the hardest tradeoff** you made. If that aligns, I’ll encourage you to formally apply right away and we’ll move quickly from there.",

With quota 1 and higher-priority seekers (Seeker_E, Seeker_B, Seeker_A) potentially obtainable, avoid committing now. However, only Seeker_C, Seeker_D, Seeker_E remain unmatched; Seeker_D was already rejected, so the main target is Seeker_E (our #1) who ranks Company_E last, making them hard to get. Still, we should keep Seeker_C warm via TALK while attempting to attract Seeker_E later; do not accept unless necessary at the end."
