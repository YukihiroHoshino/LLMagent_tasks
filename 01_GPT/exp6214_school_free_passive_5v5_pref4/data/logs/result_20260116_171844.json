Students who thrive here tend to be self-directed, curious, and consistent—people who seek challenges, ask for help when needed, and follow through.\n\nTo present your fit well, it helps to be specific about:\n- A couple of academic areas you’re excited to push further (and evidence of persistence).\n- One or two activities where you’ve had real impact (not just participation).\n- What kind of community you’re looking for—and why School_B matches that.\n\nIf you’d like, share 2–3 highlights (academics + an activity/leadership example) and what you’re hoping to get out of high school. Also, where does School_B currently sit among your choices (e.g., could we be your #1 if things align)?",

Student_C is last on our list and we already rejected them; holding out provides no upside because higher-priority students D/E are already matched elsewhere and cannot re-enter. Student_A also signals immediate commitment, reducing risk. Therefore accept now."

At round 8 only School_A and School_C remain unmatched; School_C has been my top remaining choice but they have me last in priority, so admission there is unlikely unless all higher-priority students are matched elsewhere. School_A ranks me 2nd (behind Student_E), so I have a realistic chance if Student_E is unavailable or committed. Since I have not formally applied to School_A yet and it is on my list, I should apply now with a clear commitment to increase acceptance likelihood."
