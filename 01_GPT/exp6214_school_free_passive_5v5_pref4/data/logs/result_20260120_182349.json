We don’t want to drag things out, but we also want to be confident the match is genuinely mutual.\n\nWhat would most strengthen your application:\n1) **Academics (baseline first):** a clear record of consistent performance in core subjects—especially math/English—and evidence you can handle sustained, higher-rigor work.\n2) **Activities (depth over breadth):** 1–2 commitments where you’ve shown follow-through, measurable impact, or progression (leadership, competition results, a project you iterated on, service with outcomes).\n3) **Interview focus:** be specific about *why School_B*—which programs/clubs you’d join, what you’d contribute, and a concrete example that shows initiative + collaboration.\n\nTo decide quickly and fairly, I need one key piece from you: **Where does School_B rank for you right now (e.g., #1, top 2, top 3)?** If you’re ready to prioritize us (or we’re your clear top), and you submit an [APPLY], we’re prepared to move fast.\n\nAlso: what’s one activity or project you’d most want to continue or scale up at School_B?",
              "thought": "Student_B is #3 on School_B’s true priority list (acceptable but not top). Top two (Student_D, Student_A) are not currently in this conversation; Student_A remains unmatched and ranks School_B 3rd, so there is a plausible chance to land Student_A if we wait. However, delaying risks losing Student_B to School_E or School_A, which are ranked above us on Student_B’s preference list. With only 1 seat, the best strategy is to keep Student_B engaged, signal we can decide soon with strong mutual interest, and explicitly ask for their ranking/commitment to determine whether to hold for Student_A or accept Student_B if they apply and indicate we are top/near-top."

Student_D strongly prefers School_D then School_B/C; Student_E prefers School_D/E/C. Since School_D and School_E are likely to attract D/E/B competition, there is a meaningful chance D and/or E do not apply to School_C first, giving me an opening if I apply now. Also, I have no prior interaction with School_C, so an [APPLY] is allowed and may secure a match before others pivot to C."
