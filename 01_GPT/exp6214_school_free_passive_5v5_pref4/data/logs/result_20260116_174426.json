We also value authenticity: a well-explained interest in what you want to study or do here matters more than trying to say the “right” things.\n\nOn early commitment: we don’t require an early commitment just to be considered. If you apply, we assume you’re applying because you’re genuinely interested, but you’re not penalized for also exploring other schools.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what draws you to School_A specifically (courses, activities, environment) and what you hope to focus on in high school—then I can point you to programs and opportunities that match your goals.",

Your goals align well with what we value at School_C, and we’d be excited to have you join our community.\n\nWe’re pleased to offer you a place at School_C. If you’re ready, please confirm that you intend to enroll so we can finalize your spot. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Student_E is #2 on School_C’s true priority list (very desirable) and has applied with clear interest and willingness to enroll. With quota 1 and no current matches, accepting now secures a top-tier candidate. Waiting risks losing Student_E to School_D or School_E (both rank School_C above some options) and we may not do better than #2. Therefore accept and reinforce commitment/next steps."
