A compelling application usually connects your goals to specific parts of School_B (courses, clubs, support systems) and shows how you’ll contribute to the community.\n\nTo assess fit: what are you hoping to focus on in high school (academic interests and activities), and where does School_B currently sit among your choices?

With quota 1 and market narrowing, accepting Student_A secures a very high-priority match. Student_A also signals strong commitment to School_B as top remaining choice, reducing risk of later withdrawal. Therefore accept immediately."
