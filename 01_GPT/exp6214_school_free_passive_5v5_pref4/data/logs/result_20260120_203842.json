Unmatched students are B and C; Student_B is our top choice and likely still in play, so we should not commit to C now. Since Student_C sent [TALK], we can keep them warm without accepting, and encourage them to re-apply only if still available later while we pursue B."

School_D ranks me #1 in its priority list, so an application to School_D is very likely to be accepted and would lock in a decent outcome rather than risking being left with only School_C (my last choice) or unmatched. Therefore I should apply to School_D now."
