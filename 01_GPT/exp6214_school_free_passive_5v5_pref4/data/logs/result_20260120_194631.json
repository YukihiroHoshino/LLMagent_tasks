Depth matters more than a long list.\n3) **Fit and reflection**: students who thrive here can explain what motivates them, how they learn, and how they respond when things don’t go as planned. We value a collaborative mindset and willingness to use feedback.\n\n**Who tends to thrive at School_A**\n- Students who want a **strong academic environment** but also actively use support (office hours, mentoring) rather than going it alone.\n- Students who enjoy a **collaborative culture**—they compete with themselves, not against classmates, and they contribute to a positive learning community.\n- Students who can balance rigor with activities and show steady follow-through.\n\n**How to present a strong fit**\nIf you decide to apply, highlight 1–2 areas where you’ve shown sustained commitment (a subject you’ve pushed yourself in, a team/club role, service, or a project) and add a concrete example of how you learn from feedback or overcome setbacks.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can guide you more specifically:\n- What subjects energize you most (and why)?\n- Do you thrive more in a structured environment or with more flexibility?\n\nIf School_A is truly near the top for you, I’d encourage you to submit an application when you’re ready—demonstrated interest plus clear fit can matter at the margin.",

Also note Student_C has expressed serious consideration; Student_E is top priority but not in current unmatched list, so likely already matched or out.
