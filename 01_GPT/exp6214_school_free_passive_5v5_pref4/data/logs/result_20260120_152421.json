If you choose to apply, the best way to present your strengths is to connect concrete examples (projects, competitions, service, roles) to what you want to pursue here and how you’ll contribute.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me 1–2 areas you’re most excited to study and one activity you’re proud of—then I can suggest how to frame your application for School_B.",
