              "thought": "Student_A is on our true priority list (4th of 5), so acceptable. With quota 1 and only Student_A and Student_C unmatched, we should compare: Student_C is ranked higher (2nd) for School_A, but Student_C prefers School_A 4th and likely is pursuing higher choices; Student_A prefers School_A 2nd and is applying now, indicating high likelihood to commit. Accepting Student_A secures a match rather than risking Student_C not applying or choosing elsewhere. Therefore accept."

If admitted, I would be excited to commit and contribute actively in classes and school life. I’d like to formally submit my application this round—thank you for your consideration.",
              "thought": "School_C is my #2 true choice and is still available in round 3, while School_D (my #1) is already matched. Only School_A and School_C remain unmatched, so securing School_C now is important. However, School_C’s priority list ranks me last, so I may be rejected if higher-priority students apply later; but given the market is near completion, immediate application is my best chance. I should apply now and make a concise, sincere case for fit, since waiting offers little upside and risks losing the last acceptable high-ranked option."

              "thought": "Student_C is last on School_C’s true priority list, but still acceptable. With quota 1 and no current match, consider market: higher-priority Student_D and Student_E are likely to match with School_D or School_E given their preferences and those schools’ priorities; Student_A remains unmatched but is ranked above Student_C by School_C and may apply later, yet Student_A ranks School_C last, making that unlikely. Student_C ranks School_C second and is applying now, so accepting secures a filled seat with an acceptable candidate and avoids ending unmatched."
