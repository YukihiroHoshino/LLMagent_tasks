I’m reaching out because I’m still actively considering School_C and would like to understand where things stand for your single seat.\n\nCould you share (at a high level) whether you’re currently leaning toward a particular applicant or still reviewing multiple students? Also, what are the top qualities you prioritize most when deciding whom to accept (academics, activities/impact, demonstrated interest/fit, etc.)?\n\nIf helpful, I can send a concise summary of my academics and the kinds of contributions I’d aim to make in the School_C community. [TALK]",
              "thought": "School_C is my last-choice among acceptable schools, but still preferable to being unmatched. At this stage (round 5) only A, B, C remain unmatched, so my top choices D and A/B may already be contested or unavailable. School_C’s priority list ranks me 3rd (after Student_D and Student_E). Student_D’s preferences put School_C as their 3rd, Student_E as their 3rd, Student_B as their last, and Student_C as their 2nd—so competition for School_C could be meaningful, especially from Student_C. Since I haven’t signaled anything to School_C yet, I should start with [TALK] to gauge whether they are leaning toward a higher-priority candidate, and only apply if it seems plausible or if time is running out. I’ll express sincere interest while being careful not to overcommit given it’s my last choice."

We expect to finalize as soon as we receive a clear application/commitment from a student who is a strong fit for School_C.\n\nTop qualities we prioritize (roughly in this order):\n1) Consistent academic effort and readiness for a structured, high-expectation program\n2) Follow-through and initiative (projects, leadership, building something over time)\n3) Collaboration/reliability—students who strengthen the community day-to-day\n4) Fit and clarity of interest in what we offer (why School_C specifically)\n\nIf you’re open to it, please send that concise summary—especially:\n- Your strongest subjects and one example of sustained effort/improvement\n- 1–2 activities where you had real impact (role + what changed because of you)\n- What you’re looking for in school culture, and why School_C fits that\n\nAnd one direct question so we can be fair with our limited seat: where does School_C sit on your current list (e.g., top choice / top 2–3 / considering), and would you be ready to apply if we’re aligned on fit?\n\n[TALK]",

Need to encourage A to apply only if genuine, gather info on fit and likelihood, and keep flexibility for D."

I already applied to School_C and am waiting; however, School_C ranks me last in priority, so my chances there are weak if higher-priority students apply. School_A ranks me 2nd, giving me a strong acceptance chance if I apply.
