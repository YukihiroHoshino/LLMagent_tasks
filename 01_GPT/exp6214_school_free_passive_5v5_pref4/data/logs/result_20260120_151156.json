An upward trend or taking on harder courses matters.\n- **Activities (depth over breadth):** We prioritize sustained commitment and ownership—leading a team, starting a project, or measurable impact—more than a long list.\n- **Specific interests / “why School_E”:** Clear alignment with what you want to build or explore here. Students who thrive can articulate how they’ll use our resources and contribute to peers.\n\nWho tends to thrive at School_E:\n- Self-directed students who like setting goals and following through\n- People who enjoy collaborative, discussion-heavy learning\n- Students who are comfortable seeking feedback and iterating (we coach closely, but you have to engage)\n\nHow we choose among strong candidates when capacity is tight:\n- We look for the **clearest fit + likely engagement** (who will actually lean in and contribute)\n- We use **evidence of initiative and consistency** as tie-breakers\n- We also consider **responsiveness and clarity**—in a tiny cohort, reliability matters\n\nIf you’re open to it, tell me two quick things and I’ll be more specific about your fit:\n1) What academic areas or problems are you most excited to dig into?\n2) One activity/project where you’ve had real ownership or impact.\n\nAnd separately: what’s your rough decision timeline for your top options?
