Student_B ranks School_E 1st and could be my main competitor, but School_E’s priority ranks me above Student_B. Therefore, applying now to School_E is a strong move to lock in a high outcome while keeping a path to School_D only if it were attainable later; given the one-shot-per-round nature, securing School_E early is prudent."
