Depth and commitment matter more than a long list.\n- Growth mindset: resilience when things are difficult and a pattern of learning from feedback.\n\nA strong applicant profile usually shows: steady performance over time, clear examples of initiative/leadership or impact, and teachers who can speak to your work habits and character.\n\nTo help you gauge fit, what areas are you most excited to grow in (STEM, humanities, arts, leadership/service), and what kind of school culture helps you do your best?

What tends to stand out at this stage is a clear, specific fit: one or two academic areas you’re excited to push further here, plus a concrete way you’d contribute (e.g., a club/team you’d join, a project you’d help lead, or a service effort you’d expand).\n\nOn your question about our seat: we are actively reviewing and not finalized yet, so strong candidates who are genuinely interested should apply as soon as they’re ready.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn two quick things: (a) which academic subjects you most want to deepen, and (b) one activity or initiative you’d be excited to bring to School_C.
