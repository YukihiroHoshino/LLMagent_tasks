We value exactly what you highlighted: high academic expectations paired with a supportive culture, and students who are consistent, reliable, and contribute meaningfully without overextending.\n\nWe do have an open seat, and based on your stated readiness to commit, we’re pleased to offer you admission to School_E. Please reply with confirmation of your immediate acceptance, and we’ll send the next-step enrollment details right away.",

Student_A/D/E are not available at this stage, so to avoid ending unmatched we should accept Student_B. Student_B ranks us #1 and will commit immediately, securing the seat."
