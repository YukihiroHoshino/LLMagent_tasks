If you have a specific interest, we’re also open to helping students start a new club when there’s a clear plan and participation.\n\nAdvising & support: Each student has an advisor who monitors progress and helps with goal-setting, course planning, and extracurricular balance. We also prioritize student well-being and communication with families when support is needed.\n\nWhat we value in selection: We look for students who will thrive in our environment—consistent effort, intellectual curiosity, and a positive contribution to the community (collaboration, responsibility, and follow-through). Fit matters: students who engage and make use of support do especially well here.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant details: what are your top academic interests (STEM/humanities/arts), and what kind of clubs or activities do you want to prioritize?
