This is my final, explicit commitment: if you offer me your one seat, I will accept immediately and withdraw from all other options the same moment so you can close with certainty.\n\nSince this is round 30 (the final round), can you please issue a definitive accept/reject decision now so we can finalize before the deadline? If there is any last confirmation you need from me to proceed, tell me and I will provide it immediately.",

School_A is my #2 true choice and I already applied earlier; I should not re-apply, but I should send a final commitment signal and request an immediate accept/reject decision to avoid ending unmatched. School_A ranks me last, so they may have been holding out for higher-priority students; however, at the deadline they must either accept me or remain unmatched, so a clear finalization message is optimal."

The moment you send that, I will respond right away with our definitive decision so we can close before the deadline.",

However, it is round 30 (final round) and Student_B is the only unmatched student; leaving the seat empty would be worse than matching with an acceptable (listed) student. Procedurally, Student_B sent [TALK], so I cannot issue [ACCEPT] yet; I should prompt a final [APPLY] immediately with exact wording to enable instant acceptance before the deadline."
