If you are still holding the seat for a higher-priority student, please tell me exactly which student you are waiting on and whether you expect their response before round 30.",

Under the process rules, we can only issue that final decision in response to an official [APPLY].

The best move is to prompt an immediate [APPLY] so we can accept in round 29 and close the match."
