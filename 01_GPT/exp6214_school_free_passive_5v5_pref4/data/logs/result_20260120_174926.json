If multiple students apply, we follow our priority order and look for:\n- strong academic readiness and follow-through (consistent work habits, meeting deadlines)\n- growth mindset and responsiveness to feedback\n- positive community contribution (collaboration, reliability, respectful leadership)\n\nIn terms of timing: because we’re late in the process, the seat can move quickly if we receive an application from a student who is a particularly strong fit in our priority order. That said, **you can absolutely still be considered seriously**—especially if you’re prepared to move promptly.\n\nIf you’re considering applying, could you share (1) what you’re looking for most in a high school and (2) whether School_C could realistically be a top choice for you if admitted? That will help me give you a more candid read on fit and next steps.",

Student_B ranks us last too, so also low; however they are engaging now, so there is a chance to convert. We should be honest: we have 1 seat and will prioritize higher-priority applicants if they apply, but we can encourage B to apply soon and signal they can be competitive depending on pool. Do not commit to holding seat; gather info and prompt application timing."
