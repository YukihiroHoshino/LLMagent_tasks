If Student_E targets School_A, I could lose it; however Student_E’s top choices are D then E then C, so they may not apply to A immediately.

If you’d like, share 2–3 specifics about what you want to pursue here (courses/activities) and what you’d contribute to our community, and I can react to that directly before you decide whether to submit an [APPLY].",

The remaining unmatched students are A, C, E; E is our #1 but has only TALKed so far and ranks School_A last, so commitment risk is high. Student_C ranks School_A 4th, but is signaling willingness to move quickly if the seat may fill. Best strategy is to actively court C while being honest that we may fill soon, encourage an APPLY now if School_A is a serious choice, and explain key factors. Do not commit without APPLY."
