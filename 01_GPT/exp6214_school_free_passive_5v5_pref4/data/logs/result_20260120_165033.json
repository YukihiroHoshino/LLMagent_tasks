I understand you have one seat available, and I’m ready to commit immediately if you can extend an offer this round. Thank you for considering my application.",

I have already applied to School_A (where I am lowest priority), so my chance there is weak. Applying to School_C now is a reasonable safety move to avoid ending unmatched, and I may have a decent priority position at School_C relative to some others."

Accepting Student_B secures a better-ranked match than leaving the seat unfilled or reconsidering Student_C."
