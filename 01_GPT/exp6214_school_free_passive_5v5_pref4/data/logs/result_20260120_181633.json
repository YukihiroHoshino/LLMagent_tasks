Waiting risks losing D to School_D (D’s top choice) or School_B (D ranks E last, so D may only be applying due to lack of better options, making immediate acceptance prudent). Also Student_B prefers School_E first, but School_E ranks B below D, so D is the better match. Therefore accept now and reinforce commitment, with brief guidance on emphasis."
