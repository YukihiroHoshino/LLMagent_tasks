School_A is one of my very top choices, and I’m excited about the fit: I’m looking for a rigorous academic environment and a community where I can contribute consistently (both in class and through activities). If admitted, I’m committed to enrolling. Thank you for considering my application.",
              "thought": "Only School_A remains unmatched, so securing it is critical to avoid ending unmatched. School_A is my #2 true choice (after School_E). I also know School_A ranks me last in its priority list, so if any higher-priority student is still available and applies, I could be rejected. However, given the current situation that School_A is the only unmatched school, it’s likely other students are already matched elsewhere, making this my best (and possibly only) chance. I should apply now with a clear, committed message to maximize acceptance probability."

School_A’s true priority ranks Student_B last among acceptable students, but still on the list, so accepting is preferable to leaving the seat empty.
