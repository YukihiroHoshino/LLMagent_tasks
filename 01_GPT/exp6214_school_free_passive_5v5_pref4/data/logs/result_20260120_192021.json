We encourage students to start new clubs if they have an idea and a faculty sponsor.\n- Support: proactive advising—students have an assigned advisor, plus academic support when needed (study planning, tutoring, check-ins), and we take transitions seriously so students don’t feel lost.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant details: what are you most hoping to get out of high school (e.g., advanced academics, specific clubs like robotics/music, leadership opportunities, sports, or a more supportive/structured environment)?",

In practice, we weigh:\n- **Academic readiness + growth mindset**: strong foundations, but especially evidence you take feedback and improve.\n- **Consistency and reliability**: steady effort, follow-through, good attendance/engagement.\n- **Curiosity and initiative**: pursuing interests beyond requirements (projects, reading, competitions, self-started learning).\n- **Contribution to community**: teamwork, leadership (formal or informal), service, and how you treat others.\n- **Fit with our support/rigor balance**: students who want challenge *and* will use resources (office hours, advising) rather than struggle silently.\n\n(2) **What makes School_E distinct day-to-day**\n- **Signature academic support model**: every student has an assigned advisor with scheduled check-ins, plus structured study planning when needed. Teacher office hours are built into the weekly rhythm, so getting help is normal—not remedial.\n- **Rigor with access**: advanced pathways are available, but we focus on close teacher access and clear expectations so students can actually accelerate without burning out.\n- **Student-led clubs + “start-your-own” culture**: STEM/arts/service/leadership are active, and we make it straightforward to launch a new club with a faculty sponsor.\n- **Competition/portfolio opportunities**: we encourage teams and individual entries (STEM challenges, academic contests, arts showcases) and provide coaching support where possible.\n\nTo make this concrete: what are your top 2 priorities for high school (e.g., advanced academics, a specific club/competition like robotics/debate/music, leadership, or a highly structured support system)?
