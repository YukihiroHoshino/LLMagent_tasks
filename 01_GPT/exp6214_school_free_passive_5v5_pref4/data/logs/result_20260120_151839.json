Many students also join cross-grade teams, which helps with community and mentoring.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what subjects or activities energize you most (and what kind of support helps you do your best).

We like to see sustained commitment, leadership, or meaningful contribution (team, club, service, competition, arts). It’s less about “how many” and more about impact and learning.\n\nFirst-term support to help students adjust and succeed:\n- Assigned advisor with scheduled check-ins early in the term (goal-setting, workload planning, and progress monitoring)\n- Study-skills coaching built into the start of the year (time management, note-taking, test prep, revision routines)\n- Early diagnostic/benchmarking in core subjects so we can target support quickly\n- Teacher office hours and structured peer study options for students who want them\n\nSignature programs/pathways to get involved in right away:\n- Foundation-to-Acceleration pathway: we prioritize strong fundamentals first, then guide students into honors/advanced work once readiness is demonstrated\n- Project-based work in core classes (presentations, labs, team problem-solving) so students build communication and applied thinking early\n- Club/competition “on-ramp” in the first term—students join one academic or interest-based community quickly to build belonging and momentum\n\nTo help you finalize: what are you deciding between right now (your top 2–3 schools), and what’s the single biggest factor that would make you choose School_C?
