For students aiming high, we also do periodic progress check-ins so you’re not navigating everything alone.\n\nTo help me advise you honestly: what competitive track(s) are you targeting (e.g., STEM olympiads, advanced research/projects, top-university prep), and what kind of support helps you most—structured coaching, flexible independent study, or frequent testing/feedback?

We also look for consistency and follow-through rather than just a single strong metric.\n\nOn timing: because we have only one seat, we generally don’t rush to an early commitment unless we see a very clear fit and strong alignment from the student.

In the market, School_D is likely highly contested and may already be taken; School_C is still available but I have lowest priority there, so applying now risks rejection. School_E is still available and I have some chance, though School_E’s priority ranks me last; however, other students who rank School_E highly (Student_B, Student_E) may already be pursuing other schools or matched. Given it’s round 3 and only A/C/E remain, securing School_E now could be safer than waiting and ending up forced to apply to a worse option. I should apply and make a strong fit/commitment pitch to improve acceptance likelihood despite low priority."
