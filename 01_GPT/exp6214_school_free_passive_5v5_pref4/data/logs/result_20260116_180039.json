We pay attention to how applicants describe working with others and following through.\n- Fit and reflection (often via interview/short responses): we value clear, specific reasons for School_E—what you want to do here and how you’ll use our opportunities—rather than generic “good school” statements.\n\n(2) Signature programs/clubs + support most students use:\n- Academic support: regular teacher office hours, structured peer tutoring/study groups, and advisor check-ins for planning courses and goals. Students commonly use these early (not just when struggling) to stay ahead.\n- Enrichment: academic teams (e.g., math/science/humanities-style competitions), student-led interest clubs, arts and performance groups, and service/leadership initiatives. Many students join 1–2 clubs in the first term and then deepen involvement.\n- Transition support: first-semester guidance on study routines, time management, and how to access help quickly.\n\nTo help you prepare the strongest application and confirm fit, what are 1–2 areas you’re most excited to pursue (e.g., STEM research, debate/writing, arts, service leadership), and what kind of learning environment helps you do your best?

Best move is to TALK to keep the option warm, signal serious interest, and try to learn whether Student_E is likely to take School_A; then I can decide whether to apply in a later round if School_E doesn’t work out."

And yes—because we have limited seats, we generally finalize the seat promptly once we accept an application (we don’t want to hold you in limbo, and we also can’t keep a seat open indefinitely).\n\nIf you’re willing, please do share a brief profile (a few bullets is perfect):\n- strongest subjects + any advanced coursework\n- 1–2 main activities/interests (and what you’ve built/led)\n- what you want from high school (challenge, specific pathways, clubs, culture)\nAlso, candidly: where is School_A in your final set right now, and what would you need to see to put us at #1 or #2?
