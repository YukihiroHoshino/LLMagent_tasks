What matters most is the clarity and credibility of your fit. That said, an earlier application/clear signal helps in a tight-capacity environment because we have limited seats and may fill them as strong candidates apply.\n\nIf you want to demonstrate genuine fit without applying immediately, the most helpful signals are:\n- Tell us specifically which programs/activities at School_E you’d join and why (2–3 concrete examples).\n- Share what balance you want week-to-week (academics vs. activities) and what you’d contribute to the community.\n- If possible, attend/engage with a program info session or student activity showcase and reference what you learned.\n\nGiven our limited capacity this cycle, if School_E is truly a top contender for you, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you’re comfortable—your profile sounds aligned with what we value.\n\nQuick question: if you had to rank today, is School_E realistically in your top 2–3, and what are the “couple higher options” offering that you’re comparing against?",
