Many students also do competition-based activities, but there are plenty of low-barrier clubs where beginners can jump in and grow.\n\n**Student support & culture:** You’ll find a tight-knit environment with accessible counselors/advisors, frequent check-ins, and a culture that rewards steady improvement—not just already-polished performance.\n\nTo help you judge fit: what are your top 2 priorities right now (e.g., rigorous academics, specific clubs like debate/robotics, sports, arts, college counseling, supportive environment), and what kind of learning environment helps you do your best?

With quota 1 still open and higher-priority candidates (Student_C, Student_D, Student_E) existing, School_A should avoid signaling likely acceptance to Student_B too early. Student_C is still unmatched and ranks School_A 4th, so may apply later if rejected elsewhere; Student_E ranks School_A last and may never apply, but is our top priority. Best strategy: keep conversation open, avoid commitments or predictions about others’ actions, and encourage Student_B to apply if genuinely interested while requesting concrete updates to evaluate if we end up needing to fill the seat."
