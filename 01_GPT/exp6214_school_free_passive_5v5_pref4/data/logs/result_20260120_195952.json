Before I make any final application decisions, could you share whether you still have an open seat and how you’re currently weighing demonstrated interest versus your existing priority order at this stage? Also, is there anything specific I could clarify about my profile that would help you assess my fit quickly this round?",

My top remaining is E, but E’s priority ranks me 4th and Student_A ranks E 4th, Student_D ranks E last, Student_E ranks E 2nd—competition exists and I’m not top priority there. School_A ranks me last, so my chances there are very low. School_C ranks me 4th as well, but Student_D (top at C) likely already matched elsewhere since C remains unmatched; that could improve my chances. Still, applying now to C could lock me into my worst option and prevent a later opportunity at E. Best move: keep C warm with TALK, signal conditional interest, and preserve flexibility for a possible E application later."
