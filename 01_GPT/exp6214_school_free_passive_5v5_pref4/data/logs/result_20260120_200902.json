Students can drop in for quick help or book a short slot for test/essay feedback.\n- Tutoring: peer tutoring plus teacher-led small-group review sessions around major assessments (especially in math/science and writing-heavy courses).\n- Advising/counseling: each student has an advisor for regular check-ins (goals, workload, habits). Our counseling team supports course planning, academic stress management, and longer-term planning.\n- Early-warning + follow-up: if grades dip or assignments pile up, we flag it early and coordinate a plan with the student (and family when appropriate) rather than waiting until the end of term.\n\nClubs/enrichment that are typically most active:\n- STEM/academic teams (e.g., math/science-focused groups, coding/robotics-style activities depending on the year’s student leadership)\n- Service/leadership clubs with regular community projects\n- Arts/performance and student publications\n- Sports/fitness clubs and intramural-style activities\nWe also support students starting new clubs if there’s a clear plan and a faculty sponsor.\n\nQualities we value most in incoming students:\n- Consistency and follow-through (showing up, meeting commitments)\n- Willingness to ask for help early (using office hours/tutoring proactively)\n- Positive contribution to community (collaboration, respect, reliability)\n- Curiosity—students who engage beyond “just the grade” tend to thrive here.\n\nTo help you compare realistically: what are your top 2–3 decision factors right now (academics/rigor, support structure, specific clubs, campus culture, commute, etc.)—and where do we currently sit on your list?

              "thought": "As School_C, my true priority ranks Student_B 4th (above Student_C but below D/E/A). Student_D and Student_E are likely to be taken by other schools (both rank School_D first; School_D prioritizes B then D then E, so D/E may match there; Student_A ranks C last). Given remaining unmatched are A/B/C and I already rejected C, Student_B is my best realistic option to fill quota if they will apply. I should continue engaging, clarify fit criteria, highlight pathways/support, and try to prompt an application while not committing acceptance unless they apply."
