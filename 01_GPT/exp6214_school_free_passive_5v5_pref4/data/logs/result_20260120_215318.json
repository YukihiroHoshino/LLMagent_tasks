Students who communicate early tend to benefit a lot from our advising.\n\n3) Well-rounded opportunities with real access: We encourage students to pair academics with clubs/activities and take on meaningful roles—so it’s not just participation, but growth and contribution.\n\nTo help me advise you honestly: what are you most focused on right now (e.g., STEM/humanities, specific extracurriculars, selective college goals), and where does School_C currently sit on your list?

If School_C is more exploratory for you, we can absolutely keep talking—but students who apply with a clear fit tend to move faster.\n\nTo advise you honestly: where does School_C currently sit on your list, and what are you comparing us against (academics, clubs, support, commute, etc.)? If you’re open to applying soon, share 2–3 concrete things you’d pursue at School_C, and we’ll evaluate you seriously.",

If not, I’m ready to finalize with you now—what, if anything, do you still need from me to make a decision today?",

One last quick confirmation (1–2 sentences): what is the single top subject/area you most want to pursue at School_D, and how would you contribute to the community in that area?",

Student_C is fully committed and repeatedly signals willingness to enroll immediately, reducing risk of ending unmatched. However, we should still preserve the chance to get Student_B (our top choice) by not committing until Student_C submits a formal APPLY; since Student_C is currently TALK, we should prompt APPLY and set a clear near-term decision timeline without revealing info about other applicants."

Student_A/C/D/E all rank School_D very highly, but if they were still available they would likely have applied already; with only A and D unmatched, the safest move is to apply to School_D now to lock in a match rather than risk ending unmatched while waiting on School_A where I am last priority.
