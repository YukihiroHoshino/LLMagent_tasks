Likely Student_A applies to School_D first but could be rejected there (School_D ranks A last), potentially making them available to us later. Student_D and Student_E also prefer School_D first; School_D prioritizes B highest and may accept B, so B might not remain available long. Still, to maximize chance of matching higher on our list, we reject now and keep the seat open for A/D/E; we can attempt B later if unmatched and if rounds allow, but with only one interaction per round and random pairing, this is risky.

This gives everyone a strong baseline and keeps pathways open.\n- **Placement & pacing:** In math and world language especially, we use prior preparation/diagnostics to place students appropriately (with the option to move after the first term if needed).\n- **Electives/choice:** Students typically have room for at least one elective in 9th grade (and more flexibility in later years). Many students use this to explore CS, debate, arts, or advanced language/STEM enrichment.\n- **Advanced coursework ramp:** We don’t expect everyone to overload immediately; we focus on building strong habits in 9th grade and then ramping rigor strategically in 10th–12th based on goals.\n\n**Support for top-university goals (advising + enrichment)**\n- **Advising system:** Each student is paired with an advisor who supports course planning, goal-setting, and progress check-ins. For students targeting highly selective universities, advising becomes more structured in 10th–12th with a clear timeline.\n- **Academic support:** Regular office hours, tutoring support, and teacher feedback cycles—especially in core courses—so students can push for depth without getting stuck.\n- **Enrichment pathways:** We encourage students to build a “spike + foundation” profile (deep work in one or two areas plus solid breadth). Common routes include:\n  - **Research/independent projects** with faculty mentorship\n  - **Competition teams** (e.g., math/science/CS/debate depending on interest)\n  - **Leadership + community impact** projects with measurable outcomes\n- **Planning for opportunities:** We help students identify summer programs, competitions, and project opportunities that match their interests and readiness (rather than generic resume-building).\n\nTo make this concrete: what area are you most likely to pursue deeply (STEM research/competitions, humanities/debate, arts, service/leadership, etc.)? If you share that, I can describe the typical first-year course plan and the enrichment track that fits best.\n\nIf School_A is near the top of your list, I’d strongly encourage you to apply when you’re ready—Student_E tends to thrive here, and we’d be excited to review your application.",

The key is **consistency over cramming**—students who do best here are the ones who keep a reliable schedule and ask for help early.\n- **Class environment:** Discussion + practice. You’ll see a lot of teacher-guided instruction paired with active work (seminar-style discussion in humanities; labs and problem-solving in STEM). Teachers expect participation, but it’s a supportive environment—students don’t need to be the loudest voice, just prepared and engaged.\n- **Habits that predict success:** (a) turning in solid drafts early, (b) using office hours, (c) tracking deadlines across classes, (d) being comfortable with feedback and iteration.\n\n**(2) Signature programs/pathways students commonly pursue**\nWe don’t force one track, but students often build a “home base” in one of these pathways:\n- **STEM / CS / Research:** advanced math progression, lab/research mentorship opportunities, and competition prep (students commonly pursue math/science/CS contests depending on interest). Many students also do an **independent project** that grows over multiple terms.\n- **Humanities / Debate / Writing:** seminar-style courses, writing-intensive support, and debate/public speaking options. Students often develop a **capstone-style portfolio** (research paper series, policy project, or long-form writing).\n- **Capstones & applied learning:** Older students frequently pursue a **capstone project** (research, engineering build, community initiative, or creative work) with faculty advising. Some students pair this with **internship-style experiences** during breaks or summer.\n- **Leadership + community impact:** We strongly value measurable follow-through—students who thrive often commit to one or two organizations and build real outcomes over time rather than spreading thin.\n\nIf you tell me which direction you’re leaning (STEM/CS research vs humanities/debate vs something else), I can sketch what a realistic 9th→10th grade plan looks like here.\n\nAlso, candidly: based on what you’ve shared so far, you sound like a strong fit for School_A’s culture. If School_A is in your top tier, I’d love to see you **apply** when you’re ready—our review is holistic, but we’re especially excited about students who are curious, consistent, and eager to build depth over time.",
