Student_D and Student_E are already matched elsewhere, so Student_A is now our best attainable target. Student_A currently ranks School_C last, so we should actively persuade and gather what would move them to apply, without committing a seat unless they apply. Provide clear qualities prioritized and a concrete timeline, plus tailored hooks (programs/support) and a prompt for next step."

At School_A I have strong priority (2nd), so applying now gives a good chance to secure a match rather than gamble on D/C and end up with my last choice (B) or unmatched. Since I have not applied to School_A yet and it is on my list, I should apply directly and signal commitment."
