We try to intervene early—before small gaps become stressful.\n- **Honors/advanced tracks with flexibility:** honors sections are available in core subjects, and placement isn’t “one-and-done.” If you show readiness after the first few weeks, we can move you up; if you need a different pace, we adjust without penalty.\n- **Transition support:** first-year check-ins around time management, study skills, and joining at least one activity so you build a community quickly.\n\n**Who tends to thrive at School_C**\nStudents who do well here are typically: (1) consistent in effort (even when material gets harder), (2) willing to ask for help early, and (3) community-minded—joining a club/team and contributing.\n\nTo help you compare schools: what are your top 1–2 academic priorities (e.g., strongest STEM acceleration, writing/humanities, balanced rigor), and what would need to be true for School_C to move up your list enough that you’d **apply this round** if you don’t land your first choice?",
