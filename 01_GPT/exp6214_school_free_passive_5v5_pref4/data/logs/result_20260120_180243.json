Applying now could secure School_E if higher-priority students pursue other schools; waiting risks losing it to Student_B if they get in elsewhere? Actually School_E would prefer me over B and C, but not over A or D. Student_D prefers School_D most and is high priority at many schools; A prefers School_D first.

School_D (my 1st) is still available but I have the lowest priority at School_D, so acceptance there is unlikely if higher-priority students apply. School_A’s priority ranks me 4th out of 5, so I’m also not a top candidate, but it’s still a realistic fallback compared to waiting solely on School_D. Since I have not applied to School_A yet and it is high on my list, I should apply now and signal strong commitment to improve my chances."

Student_C prefers School_D/C/E over School_A, so may not apply here soon; Student_B was already rejected and is last on our list.

School_B’s priority ranks me 4th as well (behind D, A, B), so if those students are already matched elsewhere, I may have a decent chance. Since we’re late and I risk ending unmatched, I should apply to School_B now as a safety rather than continue talking."
