Students like that tend to thrive in:\n- **Project teams/capstones** (being the person who keeps a team organized and moving is a huge asset)\n- **Peer mentoring/tutoring** roles\n- **Club leadership tracks** where you can own a piece of an event, competition prep, or community initiative\n\nTo help you decide whether School_E should move up your list: what are the 1–2 schools currently ahead of us for you, and what specific factors are making them feel like a better fit right now (academics, culture, activities, commute, something else)?

And what’s one concrete example (project/activity) that best shows your curiosity or impact? If you share that, I can tell you how to frame it in a way that aligns strongly with what we select for.\n\n[TALK]",
