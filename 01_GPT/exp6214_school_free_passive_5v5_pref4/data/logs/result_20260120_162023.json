If you have strong exam indicators, make them easy to find.\n- Fit for our culture: we value students who contribute in a collaborative, discussion-oriented setting—concrete examples (study groups, peer tutoring, team projects, debate, research, club leadership) help.\n- Interview (if applicable): be ready to explain what you want to study/explore, how you handle challenging material, and a specific example of using feedback to improve.\n- Coherence: a “through-line” (one or two sustained interests with depth) tends to read stronger than many unrelated activities.\n\nIf you’d like, send a brief outline of the 2–3 coursework/activities you’d emphasize, and I’ll tell you exactly how I’d frame them for maximum impact at School_B.\n\nOne key question so I can advise you honestly: if School_B accepts you, would you be ready to commit to us as your first choice among the schools you’re still actively considering (especially School_E and School_A)?",

Remaining unmatched students are Student_A and Student_C; Student_C is ranked higher (2nd) and may still apply, but there is no guarantee they will. With quota 1 and no current match, accepting Student_A now secures a filled seat with an acceptable candidate, avoiding the risk of ending unmatched if Student_C matches elsewhere or does not apply. Student_A is also willing to commit immediately, which reduces uncertainty."

I am last in School_E’s priority list, but if higher-priority students have already matched elsewhere (likely, since only School_E remains), I may be the only available applicant. I’ve already signaled strong intent in prior TALK messages; the optimal move is to apply immediately to try to lock the final seat."

              "thought": "School_E’s true priority ranks Student_C last but still included, so acceptable if needed. Current round 6 shows only Student_C remains unmatched; School_E has quota 1 and no current match. Waiting risks ending unfilled with no better candidates available. Student_C is applying now and signals willingness to accept immediately, which is valuable given single-seat constraint. Therefore accept to secure a filled seat with an eligible student."
