The most meaningful signal, though, is an **application with a clear statement of intent** (for example: “If admitted to School_E, I will enroll” or “I will enroll if I’m not admitted to School_D,” etc.).\n\nTo advise you honestly on whether you should apply now versus wait, can you answer two quick questions?\n- Where is School_E on your current ranking (top 1 / top 2 / top 3 / considering)?\n- If we offered admission this round, would you be ready to **commit**, or would you likely keep pursuing School_D/School_A first?\n\nIf School_E is in your top tier and you can commit (or give a clear conditional commitment), I’d strongly encourage you to apply this round—we would take your application extremely seriously.",

So yes, a decision could happen this round or next, depending on who applies.\n\nIf you’d like to strengthen your candidacy quickly, the most helpful information (in 4–6 bullets) is:\n1) Academics: your recent grades/standing and 1–2 strongest subjects.\n2) Initiative/impact: 2 examples where you took ownership or led something (what you did + measurable impact).\n3) Reliability/follow-through: one commitment you sustained over time (team, club, family responsibility, work, etc.).\n4) Why School_D specifically: 1–2 programs/clubs/paths you’d pursue here and how you’d contribute.\n\nIf you send that, I can give you direct feedback on fit and what would matter most in an application. If you decide you’re ready to proceed, you’re welcome to submit an application immediately in a future round.",

Student_B has been engaging but has not applied; Student_C is unmatched and ranks us #1, so we may be able to secure a higher-priority match if Student_C applies. Therefore, continue talking with Student_A, be transparent that we are still evaluating, and request concise fit info; do not accept or reject since they did not apply this round."

Student_C has School_C as their 2nd choice (after School_D), so their application is credible. However, I also prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting anyone not on my list; Student_C is on my list, so acceptance is allowed.
