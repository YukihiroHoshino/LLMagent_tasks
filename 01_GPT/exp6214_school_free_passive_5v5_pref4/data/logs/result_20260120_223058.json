School_A also ranks me last, so my chance there is very low. School_C ranks me 4th (behind D, E, A), which is also not great, but if those higher-priority students are already matched or focused elsewhere, C could be my best fallback.

Students who do best here are steady rather than “cram-based.”\n- **Help-seeking + follow-through**: using office hours/tutoring early, then actually applying feedback on the next assignment/test.\n- **Collaboration and classroom contribution**: we like students who can work in groups respectfully—explaining their thinking, listening well, and keeping teams on track.\n- **Resilience under rigor**: competition experience can help, but it’s not required. We see many successful students without formal contest backgrounds; what matters more is comfort with challenge and willingness to revise.\n\n**Areas we’re especially looking to build this year**\n- We’re aiming for a balanced incoming class, but we’re particularly excited about students who want to lean into **STEM depth (strong math fundamentals)** and/or students who are motivated to strengthen **writing/reading analysis** (we provide structured support and coaching).\n- We also value students interested in **student leadership and peer support** (study groups, tutoring peers, club leadership), since that strengthens the learning culture.\n\n**If you decide to apply, what to emphasize**\n- A concrete example of a time you improved (e.g., raised a grade, fixed a weak unit, built a study system) and *what you did differently*.\n- How you manage workload (planning tools, weekly routine, how you respond when you fall behind).\n- One or two academic goals for next year (e.g., “I want to solidify algebra/geometry foundations” or “I want to become a stronger analytical writer”).\n\nOne question so I can guide you honestly: **where does School_C sit on your list right now, and what would need to be true for you to apply here in the next round or two?**",

Higher-priority students for us are D and E, but they are not available in the remaining pool; among remaining students, A is ranked above B, and C is lowest (and already rejected). Student_B currently has School_C as last choice, so immediate conversion is unlikely; however, keeping them engaged could lead to an application if their top options don’t work out. Since they sent [TALK], we should respond helpfully, highlight fit and support, and gently probe likelihood/timeline to decide whether to hold out for Student_A or pursue Student_B if they become ready to apply."
