I have top priority at School_C, so if I apply now I should be accepted unless they strategically wait—which they have no incentive to do given capacity 1 and early round. Securing School_C guarantees a decent outcome, but it may reduce my chance at higher choices (D or B). However, I am only 2nd priority at School_D (behind Student_B) and Student_B ranks School_D 4th, so Student_B may not apply there early; still uncertain. At School_B I am top priority, but other students (A,B,E) rank B mid-to-low; likely available later. Given I can lock in School_C immediately with high certainty, I will apply to avoid risk of ending with a worse school if D and B become contested unexpectedly."
