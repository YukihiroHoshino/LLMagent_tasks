Since I’ve only talked so far and not applied, I should apply now to lock in a strong outcome."

This is the best possible outcome for School_C."

Student_D prefers School_D first, and Student_A prefers School_D first as well, so they may not apply to School_B immediately; that improves my acceptance chances if I apply now. With only one seat per school and some schools already matched, locking in School_B now is safer than waiting and risking losing all acceptable options. Therefore I should apply to School_B this round."

Student_D remains and is our top choice; however Student_D’s preferences place School_B as 2nd behind School_D, so we may lose them to School_D.
