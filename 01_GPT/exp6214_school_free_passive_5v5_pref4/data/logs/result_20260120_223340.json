Student_D is School_C’s top choice and is currently unmatched but prefers School_D then School_B then School_C; may become available later. Student_E is second choice for School_C and is unmatched; Student_E ranks School_C third and may apply later if rejected elsewhere. Student_A and Student_B also rank School_C last, so unlikely to apply. Given round 4/30, it is strategically better to reject Student_C now to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates who may apply later. Rejection should be respectful and keep door open for future if rules allow, but must issue REJECT to an APPLY."

Student_B also signals willingness to commit quickly, reducing risk of them preferring other schools; although B’s stated preferences rank School_C last, they are applying now and committing quickly, so acceptance is strategically sound."
