              "thought": "Student_C is #2 on School_A’s true priority list (behind Student_E). With quota 1 and only Student_C and Student_E unmatched, accepting Student_C now secures a very high-priority match. Waiting for Student_E is risky: Student_E ranks School_A last and is likely to match elsewhere (especially School_D or School_E) if possible. Therefore accept Student_C."
