At School_B, we prioritize (1) strong academic readiness and consistency, (2) clear motivation for our specific program—why School_B rather than a generic “good school,” (3) evidence you’ll contribute to the community (clubs, leadership, teamwork), and (4) reliability/commitment—students who show they’ll thrive here and follow through.\n\nOn timing: we are open to early commitment when there’s a strong mutual fit, but we also have to manage a limited seat and ongoing conversations. If School_B is a serious option for you, it helps to know where we stand relative to your other choices and what specifically attracts you to our program.\n\nTwo quick questions:\n1) What about School_B makes it a top option for you (courses, activities, learning style, goals)?\n2) If you received a spot at School_B, would you be ready to commit, or are you likely to wait on School_E/School_A first?\n\nIf your answers suggest a strong match, I’d encourage you to submit an application to School_B soon.",

With quota 1 and no current match, we should keep Student_B warm, encourage an early application, but avoid committing language that forecloses higher-priority Student_D/Student_A if they apply soon.

Since only School_A, School_B, and School_E remain unmatched and capacity is 1 each, I should secure School_B now rather than risk ending with School_E or worse.

With quota 1 and no current match, accepting secures a top-priority student. Holding out for Student_D (#1) is risky because Student_D’s preference ranks School_B second after School_D, and School_D also ranks Student_D highly; Student_D may match elsewhere. Therefore, accept Student_A now to lock in a strong outcome."

Since School_A is still unmatched, I should keep the option open and gather info, but avoid committing my one-shot application here prematurely; I should preserve flexibility to apply to School_E if/when I get the chance.

What I can say is: we will likely fill our seat with a student for whom School_A is a genuinely high choice and who submits a strong, complete application promptly.\n\nIf School_A is truly near the top of your list, you can absolutely be competitive—especially if you can clearly articulate (1) why School_A specifically, (2) your strongest academic strengths, and (3) 1–2 activities where you’ve had real impact/leadership.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you accurately:\n1) If you applied, where would School_A likely fall in your final ranking (top 1–2, top 3, etc.)?\n2) What are the 1–2 accomplishments/activities you’d want us to remember you for?\n\nIf you’re ready to apply promptly, go ahead—timeliness and clarity of fit will matter this cycle.",

We should respond without revealing sensitive strategy, encourage Student_B to apply if genuinely interested, and ask for clarity on likelihood of ranking us highly, while not promising a seat."
