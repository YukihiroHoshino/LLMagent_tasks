School_A is my #2 choice overall, and if you offer me the seat I will commit immediately and complete any final step today (deposit/forms/brief interview—anything you need).\n\nCan you please issue a final decision on my existing application right now (accept/reject)? If you’re hesitating, what is the single remaining concern or item you need from me today to finalize an acceptance before the process ends?",

I already submitted a formal application earlier, so I cannot [APPLY] again; the best move is a final, clear commitment message via [TALK] asking for an accept/reject decision immediately. Even though School_A ranks me last in its priority list, all higher-priority students must already be matched elsewhere, so School_A’s only way to fill its seat is to accept me now."

Right now you’ve said School_A is your **#2**. If you can truthfully state in your **[APPLY]** that **School_A is your #1 and you will commit today immediately if admitted**, I am prepared to finalize this promptly.\n\nIf School_A is still #2 and you can’t make that #1 commitment, then you should pursue your #1—because I cannot treat a #2 as a secure final-round commitment.\n\nSend your **[APPLY]** now if you want me to finalize.",

It is round 30 (final), School_A has 1 seat open, and Student_B is the only unmatched student remaining. No higher-priority students are available. Under the rules, Student_B sent [TALK], so I cannot issue an accept/reject in this exchange. Best move is to instruct Student_B to immediately send [APPLY] with a firm #1 commitment (they currently state #2) to allow acceptance; otherwise likely end unmatched. Since leaving seat empty is worse than matching with an in-list student, I should signal willingness to accept if they can truthfully make School_A #1 and apply now."
