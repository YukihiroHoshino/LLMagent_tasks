If multiple students look equally strong on paper, academics alone rarely decides it.\n- **Extracurricular depth/initiative**: becomes a major separator when it shows *ownership* (you built something, led a team through obstacles, produced a measurable outcome, or pursued a long-term project).\n- **Interview/personal fit**: frequently the final differentiator—clarity of purpose, reflection, and how you’d contribute to peers.\n\nProfiles that have done especially well recently aren’t tied to one “type” of activity, but they share a pattern:\n1) **Long-term commitment with progression** (member → organizer → leader/mentor).\n2) **Concrete impact** (competition results, publications/performances, community outcomes, improved systems, funds raised, participation growth, etc.).\n3) **Intellectual curiosity you can explain** (what you tried, what failed, what you learned, what you’d do next).\n\nExamples of successful shapes (not requirements):\n- A student who started a tutoring/peer-learning program and can show sustained participation and outcomes.\n- A club leader who redesigned how the group operates (curriculum, outreach, partnerships) and can quantify growth.\n- A research/engineering/art project pursued over months with iterations and a clear narrative of improvement.\n\nTo present your candidacy clearly, I’d recommend you prepare:\n- A 60–90 second “through-line” connecting your academic interests → one deep activity/project → why School_A.\n- One story that demonstrates resilience (a setback and how you responded).\n- One specific way you’d contribute here (a club you’d join/expand, a project you’d bring, a community role you’d take).\n\nSo I can advise more precisely: what’s the *one* activity or project you feel best represents you, and where does School_A currently sit among your top choices if you had to rank today?",
