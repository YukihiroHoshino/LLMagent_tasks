              "message": "Hi Student_E—really glad you’re still considering School_C. Here’s a clearer picture of what support and “signature” opportunities look like in practice:\n\n(1) Day-to-day academic support (how students get help early)\n- Advisory check-ins: You have a dedicated advisor who meets with you regularly (and is available in between) to review workload, grades/feedback, and goals. If something starts slipping, the advisor helps you make a plan immediately—study schedule, teacher office hours, and skill practice—so it doesn’t become a bigger issue.\n- Teacher office hours + quick feedback loops: Teachers hold structured office hours, and students are encouraged to use them proactively (not just before exams). Many courses also use short formative checks so students and teachers can spot gaps early.\n- Targeted skill help: When a student needs it, we connect them to focused support (e.g., writing organization, problem-solving routines, test corrections, study systems). The goal is to build durable skills, not just “get through” one assignment.\n\n(2) Signature opportunities students commonly take advantage of\n- Project-based teams and academic clubs tied to a “focus area”: Students often join a sustained team/club (STEM, humanities, arts) where they build a portfolio over time with faculty guidance—great for growth and for finding what you genuinely want to pursue.\n- Competitions/showcases and advanced pathways: For students who want to stretch, we support advanced coursework and encourage participation in competitions/showcases (academic, research/presentation-style, or creative), with coaching and structured milestones so it’s manageable.\n\nTo help you make a final decision: what are the 1–2 areas you most want to grow in next year (subject/skills or an activity)? And are you leaning toward applying to School_C this round if it still feels right after this?\n\nIf you’re close to deciding, I’d love to see your application—School_C would be excited to seriously consider you.",
