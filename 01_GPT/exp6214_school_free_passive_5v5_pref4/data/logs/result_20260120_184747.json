I’m glad you’re considering School_A, and I appreciate the thoughtful questions.\n\n**(1) What we’re looking to confirm in conversations**\nIn a short conversation, we try to understand:\n- **Academic readiness + habits**: how you approach challenging material, how you study, and how you respond when something doesn’t click at first.\n- **Growth mindset**: concrete examples of improvement over time (not just “I work hard,” but what you changed and what happened).\n- **Community contribution**: how you collaborate, lead, or support others—clubs, teams, projects, peer tutoring, etc.\n- **Genuine fit**: what you’re excited to explore here (subjects, activities, projects) and what kind of environment helps you thrive.\n\n**(2) Early offers vs. waiting**\nBecause our capacity is limited, we **don’t want to drag decisions out unnecessarily**. If a student applies and the fit is clear, we’re prepared to move **quickly** rather than waiting many rounds “just because.” At the same time, we’re careful to be consistent and fair—so we typically make decisions once we’ve seen a student’s application signal and had enough context to be confident.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing two quick things, I can be more specific about fit:\n1) What are your top priorities for high school (most rigorous academics, specific clubs/competitions, arts, support/mentoring, culture)?\n2) What’s drawing you to School_A in particular compared with the other schools you’re considering?\n\nIf School_A is a serious option for you, applying sooner rather than later helps us respond promptly.",
