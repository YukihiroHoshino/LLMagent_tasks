Given priorities, School_A ranks me last and is likely to take someone else; School_D ranks me first but may already be taken or may accept me later; School_C ranks me 4th and could be a fallback if D doesn’t work out. Since applying now could lock me into my least-preferred option, I should TALK to keep the option open without committing, while I try to secure a better match (especially School_D)."

If you’re potentially interested in applying soon, I can also be transparent about where you see us on your list so we can advise you responsibly.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can guide you well:\n1) What are you optimizing for most (STEM depth, humanities, arts, leadership/service, competition teams, or overall support/culture)?\n2) At this moment, is School_C in your top tier, middle, or more of a backup option?\n\nIf you share that, I’ll point you to the specific tracks/clubs and support structures that best match what you’re looking for—and suggest next steps on timing.",

However, we should keep Student_B warm and encourage an application with clear timeline, while probing their likelihood of ranking us highly. Provide distinguishing features and signal limited seat without promising acceptance."
