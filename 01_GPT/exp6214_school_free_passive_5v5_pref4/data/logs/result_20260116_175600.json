I also can’t speak to any specific other student’s likelihood of applying. What I *can* say is that applicants who show clear, informed interest in School_A and submit a timely application tend to be advantaged in our review.\n\n2) What would make your application most compelling this cycle:\n- **Clear “why School_A”**: 2–3 specific program/culture reasons (courses, supports, clubs, learning style) tied to your goals.\n- **Evidence of sustained effort**: a short narrative of how you improved, handled challenge, or pursued depth in an area.\n- **Community contribution**: one concrete example of leadership, collaboration, or service—impact matters more than titles.\n- **Authentic fit**: what environment helps you thrive and what you’ll add to ours.\n\nFrom our side, based on our conversation so far, I do think there’s strong mutual fit. If School_A is a serious option, I’d encourage you to submit an application soon—then we can evaluate you formally and keep momentum. If you share what your top two priorities in a school are (e.g., academic rigor vs. support, STEM/humanities, arts/athletics), I’ll respond with the most relevant parts of School_A and how you’d plug in.\n\n[TALK]",

Student_A ranks School_C last and has not committed, so the probability of securing a higher-priority match (A) is low. Student_B is applying now and explicitly committing, giving a guaranteed fill with an acceptable-ranked student.
