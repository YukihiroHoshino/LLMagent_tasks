However, in the current unmatched set only A, B, C remain; D and E are already out of the remaining pool, so the only higher-priority candidate still available is Student_A and Student_B. Student_A has indicated School_C is low on their list, making their eventual application uncertain; Student_B has not engaged and ranks School_C last, also unlikely to apply. Given Student_C’s explicit commitment to enroll if admitted, accepting maximizes certainty of filling the seat with an eligible student rather than risking ending unmatched."
