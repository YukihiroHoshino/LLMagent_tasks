Activities matter, but we value sustained commitment and reliability over “stacked” résumés.\n\nWhat makes an applicant stand out for us this year:\n- Clear evidence of consistency over time (e.g., steady grades/trend, attendance, long-term responsibilities)\n- Specific examples of following routines and improving through feedback\n- A collaborative track record (helping peers, being dependable in group work)\n\nSupport/opportunities for reliable, motivated students:\n- Strong routines: predictable pacing, clear rubrics, frequent check-ins\n- Academic support: structured office hours/tutoring and progress monitoring\n- Responsibility pathways: roles in class/community projects where consistency is rewarded\n\nTwo quick questions to understand your fit better:\n1) What’s one long-term commitment you’ve maintained (how long, what you did weekly)?\n2) In a structured setting, what helps you most—weekly check-ins, detailed rubrics, or paced deadlines?\n\nIf School_C is truly near the top for you, I encourage you to submit an [APPLY] when you’re ready—our seat is limited, and we do take serious interest in students who match our structured, reliable profile.",
