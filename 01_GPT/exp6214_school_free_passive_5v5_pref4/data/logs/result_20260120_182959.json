At School_D priority order is B > D > E > C > A, so I (E) am 3rd there and could plausibly win if B and D go elsewhere, but D is very popular. At School_E priority is A > D > E > B > C, so I am 3rd there as well; B ranks E first, A ranks D first, C ranks D first, D ranks D first, so competition for D/E is intense. For School_C, priority is D > E > A > B > C, so I am 2nd, which is strong; however Student_D ranks School_C 3rd and could take it if rejected from D/B.
