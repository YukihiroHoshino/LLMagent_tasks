Student_A is 3rd on our list and preferable to Student_B. Student_A is applying now and states readiness to confirm promptly, which reduces risk of holding the seat. Accepting now secures a high-priority feasible match within quota 1; rejecting would risk ending with lower-priority B or no match."

Critically, School_D’s priority ranks me #1, giving me an excellent chance if I apply. Other students who like School_D (A,C,D,E) exist, but if they are still unmatched they may also approach; applying now should lock in the match. Therefore, apply to School_D this round."
