Leadership is earned through contribution and reliability, not just titles.\n\nIf you’re open to it, tell me:\n- What 1–2 areas you most want to develop in high school (STEM/humanities/arts/etc.), and\n- One way you like to contribute to a community (teaching/helping, organizing, creating, competing, service, etc.).\n\nIf after this you feel School_A is a top contender, I’d encourage you to **apply when you’re ready**—we’d take your application very seriously.",
