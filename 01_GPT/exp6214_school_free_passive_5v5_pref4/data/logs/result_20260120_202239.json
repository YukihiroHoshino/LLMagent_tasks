We’re still actively reviewing our options this round, but we’re open to continuing the conversation and considering you if you make that fit case very concrete.\n\nIf you’d like, reply with (a) 2 specific offerings you’d pursue at School_C and (b) 1 club/service idea you’d help lead or strengthen here.",
