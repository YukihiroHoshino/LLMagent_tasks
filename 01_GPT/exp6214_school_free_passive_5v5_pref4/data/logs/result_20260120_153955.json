I wanted to reiterate that School_C is one of my very top choices, and if offered admission I would be ready to commit promptly. I’m especially interested in the academic culture and how students are supported to excel (e.g., advising/tutoring, enrichment/advanced coursework). If there’s any additional information I can provide to strengthen my candidacy, I’d be grateful to share it.",
              "thought": "School_C is my 2nd choice (after School_D). School_D is likely already matched given it's top for many, so securing School_C is important. I have already applied to School_C in the past, so I cannot apply again; I should follow up with a strong [TALK] message to reinforce fit and signal commitment, hoping to be held/accepted if they consider my application. Note School_C’s priority ranks me last, so I need to differentiate and express clear intent to enroll if offered."

Students typically have an assigned advisor who checks in on course planning and workload balance, and teachers hold regular office hours/extra help sessions. We also offer peer tutoring and targeted support blocks for students who want additional practice or coaching in specific subjects.\n\nFor enrichment/advanced coursework: students can pursue advanced sections in core subjects (where available), plus project-based opportunities and academic clubs/competitions that provide extension beyond the standard curriculum. We encourage students to build a coherent “path” (e.g., STEM depth, humanities depth, or a balanced track) rather than simply maximizing difficulty.\n\nIf you’d like to strengthen your candidacy, the most helpful information to share is:\n1) Your strongest and most challenging courses so far (and recent performance/trajectory)\n2) One or two sustained activities/projects where you showed initiative and follow-through\n3) What you specifically want to pursue at School_C (a subject area, program, or type of challenge) and why it fits you\n\nIf you send a brief snapshot along those lines, I can give more tailored guidance on fit and how your profile aligns with what tends to succeed here.",
