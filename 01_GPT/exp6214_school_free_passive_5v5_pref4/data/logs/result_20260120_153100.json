I’m glad School_A is on your preferred list.\n\nAdmissions timeline (for this matching-style cycle): we’re reviewing conversations and applications on a rolling basis each round, and once we extend an [ACCEPT] on an [APPLY], our single seat is filled and we exit further negotiations. So if School_A is a serious option for you, it’s best to apply as soon as you’re ready rather than waiting.\n\nWhat we prioritize most when deciding between applicants:\n1) Sustained academic rigor and curiosity (evidence you seek challenge and can thrive in it).\n2) Initiative with follow-through (starting/improving something and sticking with it long enough to show real impact).\n3) Community contribution and fit (how you collaborate, support peers, and add to school life consistently).\n\nOn your question about our seat: we are still open to new applications this round, and we’re speaking with candidates, but we have not finalized a match yet.\n\nTo advise you well: where does School_A currently sit on your list (top choice vs. one of several), and what’s one concrete example of a long-term commitment or project you’ve sustained?
