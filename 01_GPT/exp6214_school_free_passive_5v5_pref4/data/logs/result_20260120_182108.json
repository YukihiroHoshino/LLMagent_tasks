I have relatively strong priority at School_B (#2), so if I apply I have a good chance unless Student_D applies (they are #1 there). However, Student_D’s top choice is School_D and they may not pivot to School_B unless rejected. School_D is my top choice but I’m last in its priority, so my chances there are low. School_A is my 2nd choice but I’m #4 in its priority, also difficult. Given the market and that School_B is still unmatched, it’s optimal to secure a strong, realistic option now by applying to School_B."

Waiting for Student_D is risky because Student_D prefers School_D first and School_D ranks Student_D highly, so we may not get Student_D later.

Because we only have one seat, it can fill quickly once formal applications start—so if School_A is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you’re ready.\n\nTo tailor advice: what are your top 2 priorities in choosing a school, and where does School_A currently sit on your preference list?",
