Check likelihood of higher-priority students coming: Student_A ranks us 4th; Student_D ranks us 5th (last); Student_E ranks us 2nd (after School_D). School_D is top choice for most and has high priority for Student_B, so Student_E may not get School_D and could apply to us later; but uncertain. Given our goal to match as high as possible on our list, it is better to hold the seat for Student_E (rank 3) who is more likely to consider us than Student_A/D, and we can still potentially accept B later if unmatched (though not guaranteed).
