I have not applied yet, and delaying risks ending unmatched if the process closes. School_A’s priority ranks me 2nd (behind Student_E), but Student_E is likely already matched elsewhere since only School_A is left. Therefore applying now should secure the only remaining seat and is better than being unmatched."
