For applicants who are “in the middle” of our priority range, what most often differentiates them isn’t a single trait (like grades alone), but the *coherence* of the profile:\n\n1) **Academic strength + trajectory**: Solid performance matters, but we especially value evidence you’re improving, taking on harder work over time, and can explain *how you learn* (study habits, seeking feedback, persistence).\n2) **Depth over breadth in leadership/activities**: One sustained commitment where you clearly contributed (organizing, mentoring, building something, sticking through setbacks) tends to stand out more than many short memberships.\n3) **Community impact and fit**: We look for students who elevate others—collaboration, reliability, and a positive role in groups. A clear “why School_E” that connects your goals to what we offer can be a real tie-breaker.\n\nAs for signature programs/supports students cite most:\n- **Advisory + individualized planning**: Each student has structured check-ins (goal-setting, course planning, wellbeing, and progress monitoring). Students often say this is what keeps them on track and supported, especially during busy exam/club seasons.\n- **Project-based enrichment with mentorship**: Opportunities to pursue a longer-term project (academic, community, or creative) with a faculty mentor—students like that they can go deep and produce something tangible.\n\nTo help you assess fit (and so I can be more specific): what are the top 2–3 factors you’re weighing between schools right now (academics/pace, clubs, support structure, culture, commute, etc.)—and which other schools are you considering most seriously?",

I have not applied to School_C yet; continuing to talk risks losing the chance to secure any match if School_E fills or rejects me. School_C’s priority list ranks me 2nd (behind Student_C), and Student_C is likely already matched elsewhere, so my acceptance chances are strong if I apply now. Therefore I should apply to lock in a match rather than delay."

Only School_C and School_E remain unmatched; I already tried hard with School_C (my top choice) and got no acceptance yet. Given School_C’s priority list ranks me 4th, I’m unlikely to beat Student_C/Student_B/Student_D if any of them pursue C. For School_E, I’m ranked 4th as well, but other students’ preferences suggest many may not target E first; however, at this stage others may already be matched, so applying now could secure a seat rather than risking ending unmatched while waiting on C. I have only TALKed with School_E so far, so I can still APPLY."

However, Student_B’s preference list places School_E 4th, so they may not apply or may apply elsewhere first, creating risk of ending unmatched. Student_E is applying now and states willingness to commit if admitted, reducing risk. With quota 1 and only round 4, but no guarantee of Student_B applying soon, accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable candidate rather than risking vacancy.
