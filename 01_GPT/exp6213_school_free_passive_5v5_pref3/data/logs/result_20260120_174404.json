In the remaining market, only Student_B and Student_C are unmatched; Student_C ranks below Student_B on our list. Student_B states School_B is #1 and will commit, which reduces risk. Accepting now secures a relatively high-priority match and uses our only seat; waiting offers no path to Student_D/Student_A since they are not in the remaining pool. Therefore accept."

I believe I’d be a strong fit for School_E’s community, and I’m prepared to commit if accepted. If there’s any specific information you want me to highlight (academics, activities, goals), I’m happy to share it right away.",
              "thought": "Only School_E remains unmatched in round 4, so I likely have not secured any other match. School_E is on my true list (last choice), but matching is better than being unmatched. I also have high priority at School_E (2nd after Student_A), and Student_A is likely already matched elsewhere. Since this is the final available school, I should apply now to secure a seat."
