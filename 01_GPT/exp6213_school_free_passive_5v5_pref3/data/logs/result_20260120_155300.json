Given other students’ preferences, Student_D and Student_E likely matched earlier (Student_D is highly prioritized by multiple schools; Student_E prefers School_C/B/A over D). If School_D is still unmatched now, I have a strong shot and should apply immediately rather than risk losing the seat in a later round."

I already applied to School_D and, given School_D’s priority list ranks me last, acceptance is unlikely. School_E ranks me first in its priority list, so applying here likely secures a match and avoids the risk of being left unmatched if School_D rejects me. Therefore I should apply to School_E now as a safe fallback."
