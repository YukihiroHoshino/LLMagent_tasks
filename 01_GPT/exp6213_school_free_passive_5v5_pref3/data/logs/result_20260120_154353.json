I’m glad School_B is a strong option for you, especially if you’re looking for both rigor and an active community.\n\n**What we prioritize most in selection**\n- **Academic readiness + trajectory**: strong fundamentals and evidence you can handle sustained challenge (we care about growth and consistency, not just a single standout result).\n- **Initiative and follow-through**: meaningful involvement where you took ownership, improved something, or stuck with a commitment long enough to make impact.\n- **Fit for our learning culture**: students who thrive here tend to be collaborative, curious, and comfortable asking questions/using feedback.\n- **Contribution to community**: how you make teams/classes/clubs better—reliability, communication, and constructive leadership matter a lot.\n\n**Who tends to thrive at School_B**\nStudents who do best typically:\n- manage their workload steadily (planning ahead rather than cramming),\n- participate actively (discussion, labs, office hours),\n- take initiative (start or strengthen a project/club/service effort), and\n- work well with others while still pushing themselves academically.\n\n**Programs/clubs/contributions we especially value**\nRather than one “right” club, we value *depth and impact*. Examples of contributions that stand out:\n- leading a team through a season/project cycle and mentoring newer members,\n- launching or improving a community initiative (tutoring, outreach, event series),\n- sustained research/competition prep with clear reflection on what you learned,\n- arts/performing groups where you contribute consistently and elevate the group.\n\nA quick question so I can give you the most relevant picture: what areas are you most excited to pursue (STEM/humanities/arts), and what role do you usually take in activities (builder/organizer/mentor/competitor)? If School_B feels like the right fit, we’d be happy to see an **[APPLY]** when you’re ready.",

In practice, that means we’re most able to extend/confirm an offer when a student is prepared to apply promptly rather than “maybe later.”\n\n**Capacity later in the process**\nWe can still seriously consider strong-interest students later *if our seat remains open*. However, since we have limited capacity (one seat), if we reach alignment with another student earlier, we may have to close the seat before later expressions of interest.\n\nTo advise you candidly on competitiveness and timing: where does School_E sit on your current shortlist (top choice / top tier / one of several), and what are 1–2 academic or extracurricular areas you’ve gone deepest in so far? If School_E became available with a clear path, would you be ready to submit an application immediately this round?",
