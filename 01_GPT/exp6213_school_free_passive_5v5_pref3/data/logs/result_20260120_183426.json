With quota 1 and only Students A, C, E remaining unmatched, accepting Student_E secures a very high-priority match. Student_E ranks School_D 4th, but they are applying now; waiting risks losing the seat to another school’s acceptance or ending with a lower-priority option. Therefore accept and reinforce commitment/next steps."

Could you share (1) what your first-year course placement process looks like (especially for advanced math/science or writing), and (2) what kinds of students tend to thrive most at School_C culturally? Also, if admitted, is there anything you look for in a short statement/interview that helps you see fit beyond grades?",

However, since it’s only round 3 and my top choice School_D is still unmatched, I should avoid locking in too early. Best move is to keep School_C warm with [TALK] while I try for School_D in later rounds; I can apply to School_C as a strong fallback if D (and possibly A/B) don’t work out."

              "message": "Hi Student_C—thank you for being transparent about your timeline. I’m glad School_C is still in strong consideration, and I’m happy to clarify.\n\n(1) First-year course placement (advanced math/science & writing)\n- Placement inputs: we look at your middle-school transcript/grades, teacher recommendations, and (where applicable) a short diagnostic/placement task in math and writing. The goal is the *right* level on day one—not “highest possible label.”\n- Math: students are placed into an appropriate sequence based on demonstrated mastery. If you’re ready for an accelerated track, we’ll place you there; if you’re close, we may start you one step earlier with a clear pathway to move up.\n- Science: first-year science is typically a common foundation with options for honors/advanced sections depending on readiness; lab skills and consistency matter as much as test performance.\n- Writing/humanities: we place students based on a brief writing sample and prior coursework. We care about clarity of thinking and willingness to revise; students can move levels as they show growth.\n- Flexibility: placement is not “locked.” We do structured check-ins early in the term, and if you’re under- or over-placed, we adjust quickly.\n\n(2) Who thrives at School_C culturally\nStudents who do best here tend to be:\n- Curious and proactive (they ask questions, seek resources, and pursue interests beyond the minimum)\n- Collaborative (they like being challenged, but don’t see peers as obstacles)\n- Comfortable with feedback (they revise, iterate, and improve rather than aiming for perfection on the first try)\n- Community-minded (they contribute—through clubs, tutoring, service, arts, teams, or simply being reliable and respectful)\n\n(3) Short statement/interview: what helps us see fit beyond grades\nWhat stands out most is specificity and reflection:\n- A concrete example of a project/interest you’ve pursued and what you learned from it (especially a moment you struggled and how you responded)\n- How you contribute in groups (teammate habits, leadership style, how you handle disagreement)\n- What you want to *build* here (a club you’d join/start, a competition you’d try, a theme you’d explore), and why School_C is the right environment for that\n- Evidence of follow-through (not a long list—one or two sustained commitments with depth)\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what’s one academic area you most want to accelerate in next year (e.g., math, lab sciences, writing), and one activity you’d be excited to commit to or launch at School_C? Also—since you’re finalizing this week—if School_C is near the top of your list, I’d encourage you to submit an [APPLY] when you’re ready so we can move from “fit conversation” to a concrete decision.\n\n[TALK]",
