I’m glad to hear your interest remains strong.\n\nOn what differentiates final admits when we have multiple strong students:\n- Academic readiness is the baseline (consistent performance and evidence you can thrive in a rigorous pace).\n- What most often *separates* top candidates is clarity of purpose and contribution: a specific, credible sense of what you’ll do here (clubs/teams/projects/service) and how you collaborate with others.\n- We also weigh character and consistency heavily—how you respond to challenges, follow-through, and the way you elevate peers.\n- Activities matter less as a “long list” and more as depth/impact (one or two meaningful commitments with real ownership).\n\nTiming / “early vs. sustained interest”:\n- We don’t require repeated outreach to prove interest, but sustained, concrete interest helps us understand fit.\n- Practically, we *can* make decisions as soon as we have a clear picture (application + fit). If School_C is a serious top option for you, applying sooner is beneficial because it lets us evaluate you while our seat is still open.\n\nMost distinctive parts of School_C (culture + academics):\n- Culture: collaborative and supportive—students push for excellence but share resources, mentor younger students, and take pride in being dependable teammates.\n- Academics: rigorous core classes with strong teacher access and structured support; we value inquiry-based learning and students who like to go beyond the minimum (projects, competitions, independent exploration).\n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d love to hear two quick specifics: (1) one activity or project you’d want to pursue or start at School_C, and (2) what makes School_C a top choice relative to your other options.
