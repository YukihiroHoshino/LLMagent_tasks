Here is the clear final status in round 29:\n\n- We are not holding the seat for any higher-priority student (Student_C/Student_B/Student_D).\n- We are ready to extend you the offer and finalize with you immediately.\n\nBecause your message is tagged [TALK], we cannot make the official offer in this exchange. Please send a one-line formal application with the tag [APPLY] (you can literally just write “[APPLY]”). As soon as we receive it, we will reply immediately with [ACCEPT] and confirm your seat this round.",

All higher-priority students (C, B, D) are not available; only Student_E remains unmatched in round 29 with my quota open. I should secure a match with Student_E, but per rules I can only [ACCEPT] in response to an [APPLY]. Student_E keeps sending [TALK], so I must respond with [TALK], clearly stating we are ready to accept immediately upon receiving [APPLY], and confirm we are not holding for higher-priority students."
