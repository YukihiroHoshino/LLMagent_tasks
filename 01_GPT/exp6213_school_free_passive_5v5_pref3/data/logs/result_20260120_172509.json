Yes, there’s definitely a path forward, and I appreciate that you’re genuinely open to School_E.\n\nAmong remaining applicants, what we’re prioritizing most right now is:\n1) **Academic readiness + trajectory** (evidence you’ll thrive in a faster-paced, discussion/problem-set environment)\n2) **Depth of contribution** (1–2 sustained commitments where you’ve built something, led, or had measurable impact)\n3) **Community fit** (reliability, collaboration, and how you’ll contribute day-to-day)\n4) **Clear program fit** (a specific seminar interest or a capstone/project idea you’d pursue here)\n\nIf you’re willing, please send that concise summary—ideally in 5–7 bullets covering: (a) top academic strengths/interests, (b) one sustained activity + your concrete impact, (c) how you work on teams, and (d) one specific School_E program/project you’d want to plug into.\n\nAlso, to be transparent and help us move efficiently: where does School_E sit on your list right now (top choice / top 2–3 / mid-list), and if you decided to proceed, could you submit an **[APPLY]** in the next round or two?",

Student_B is ranked higher (3rd) than Student_E, so we should avoid committing to E unless E applies immediately and B seems unlikely. Student_E is currently just talking. Best move: keep E engaged, request a concise profile, and signal that applying soon helps while not promising acceptance. Maintain flexibility for a potential application from B."

Student_A ranks School_B 4th and is top priority at School_E, so A may go elsewhere. Student_D ranks School_B 3rd but is top priority at School_D and School_D is already matched, so D is likely not competing for School_B now. Student_C ranks School_B 3rd and has lower priority at School_B than me. Student_E ranks School_B 2nd but is lowest priority at School_B.
