The goal is to get you into advanced courses sooner *without* burning you out.\n- **Olympiad/contest support:** We run structured problem-solving groups (faculty-supported plus older-student mentoring). Students typically do weekly sets, solution write-ups, and timed practice blocks as the season approaches. If you tell me which contests (math/physics/chem/CS), I can point you to the closest training group.\n- **Research / mentorship / long projects:** The most successful “research-style” students here usually start through a club/team or a faculty-sponsored project track: you define a question/build goal, iterate, and document results. We value sustained work and clear write-ups/presentations over flashy one-offs.\n\n(2) **Support for top university pathways**\n- **Proactive advising (multi-year planning):** Early mapping of courses + activities so you build a coherent STEM story (advanced coursework + one or two deep commitments), rather than spreading thin.\n- **Academic support that’s actually usable:** Regular teacher help sessions, peer tutoring, and check-ins around workload management—especially for students taking the hardest sequence.\n- **Enrichment guidance:** We help you choose the *right* external programs/competitions/summer options based on your profile and time constraints, and we push for depth/impact over resume-stuffing.\n\n(3) **What first year often looks like for a rigorous STEM + clubs/leadership student**\n- **Fall (settling in + placement):** You’ll confirm your math/science level quickly, set a realistic weekly schedule, and join 1–2 core clubs (often one STEM-heavy, one community/interest). We strongly encourage starting with depth rather than joining everything.\n- **Winter (skill-building + momentum):** Contest-prep or project teams become more structured (weekly problem sets or build milestones). This is where students typically form study groups and start taking on small leadership responsibilities (e.g., leading a practice session, owning a project module).\n- **Spring (output + leadership trajectory):** Students who thrive usually produce something tangible—competition results, a polished project/demo, or a presentation—and then step into clearer roles for year 2 (team lead, event organizer, mentor to younger students).\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you precisely:\n1) Which direction is most “you” right now: **contests**, **research/projects**, or **engineering/building**?\n2) When you say you’re finalizing your application order—where does School_C sit (top 1–2, top 3, etc.)?\n\nIf School_C is genuinely near the top for you, I’d encourage you to place us early in your application order so we can seriously plan your STEM pathway from day one.",
