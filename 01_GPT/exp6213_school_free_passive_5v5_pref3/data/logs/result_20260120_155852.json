Thoughtful, specific examples matter more than listing many activities.\n\nOn timing: we generally don’t make binding “early” decisions based on an initial conversation alone. We review applicants as information comes in and may extend offers once we have enough to evaluate fit relative to our limited seats.\n\nIf you’d like to present your interest well, tell me: what draws you specifically to School_C (a class, program, or environment), and what’s one area you’re most excited to contribute to here?",
