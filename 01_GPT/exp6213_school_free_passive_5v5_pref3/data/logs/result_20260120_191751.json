Student_B ranks us #1, so acceptance is likely stable and prevents losing the seat to other schools. Therefore accept."

Student_D prefers School_C first but School_C ranks D behind C and B; Student_B prefers School_B first and is ranked #1 there, so B likely takes B.

That said, because we have only one seat, we do prioritize applicants who are clear about their timeline and likelihood of enrolling.\n\nTo help you decide (and so I can be transparent about next steps), could you share:\n- Your current top 2–3 schools (in order), and where School_E sits right now\n- Your decision timeline (are you hoping to apply this round or later?)\n- One example of something you’ve pursued consistently (class, club, project) and what you’d want to plug into at School_E\n\nIf after that you feel we’re a strong fit, I’d encourage you to apply—we can make a prompt decision for you.",

At School_A I’m last priority, so unlikely. At School_B I’m 4th priority, also unlikely. At School_C I’m top priority, so if I apply I should be accepted and secure a solid match rather than risk ending up at E or unmatched.
