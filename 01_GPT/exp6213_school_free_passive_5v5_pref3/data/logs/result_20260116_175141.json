We don’t expect perfection; we do expect steady effort, preparedness, and willingness to revise/learn from mistakes.\n- Clubs: we strongly encourage joining 1–2 clubs in the first term to explore, then narrowing to what you genuinely enjoy. Depth matters more than collecting memberships.\n\nSignature programs to explore early:\n- Academic teams/competitions: debate/public speaking, STEM/robotics-style teams, math/science challenges, and writing/arts showcases (students can join in the first year and grow into leadership).\n- Project-based enrichment: short-cycle projects where first-years can build a portfolio (research, engineering builds, community-impact initiatives).\n- Leadership pathways: club officer pipelines and peer-mentor opportunities that often start with “assistant” roles for first-years who show reliability.\n\nTo tailor recommendations: if you had to pick one area to lean into in your first semester—STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, or service—what would it be? And what kind of challenge motivates you most (competitions, long-term projects, or leadership/organizing)?",
