I’m happy to clarify what we prioritize and what tends to separate closely ranked applicants.\n\n**What we prioritize most in selection**\n1) **Academic readiness + habits**: strong fundamentals, consistent effort, and curiosity. We look for evidence you can handle rigor and keep improving.\n2) **Character and reliability**: integrity, follow-through, respectful collaboration, and how you contribute to a positive learning environment.\n3) **Community contribution**: meaningful extracurricular engagement (depth over sheer quantity), leadership/service, and initiative.\n\n**What distinguishes closely ranked applicants** (when many are academically strong)\n- **Trajectory and ownership**: students who can point to growth and explain how they responded to challenges.\n- **Initiative with impact**: starting/improving something (a project, club effort, tutoring, community service) and being able to describe results.\n- **Fit with our culture**: students who thrive in a “high challenge + high support” environment—ambitious but collaborative.\n\n**Signature programs / first-year opportunities we especially value early engagement in**\n- **First-year seminar/advisory** focused on study habits, goal-setting, and community building (students who lean in here tend to thrive quickly).\n- **Project-based learning opportunities** (academic or community-facing). We like students who propose an idea and seek mentorship early.\n- **Clubs/teams with real responsibility**: joining is great, but taking on a concrete role (organizing, mentoring, building something) stands out.\n\nTo tailor guidance (and to understand fit):\n1) What areas are you most excited to grow in next year (STEM, humanities, arts, service/leadership, something else)?\n2) What kind of school culture helps you do your best (structured vs. flexible; collaborative vs. competitive)?\n3) Where is School_E currently on your list, and what would you need to see to feel confident choosing us if admitted?",
