We do aim for a rigorous, fundamentals-first program.\n\nWhat we prioritize most in applicants:\n- Consistent academic habits and evidence you can handle sustained rigor (strong core grades, upward trends, challenging coursework).\n- Curiosity and persistence—students who ask good questions, revise work, and seek feedback.\n- Balanced profile: solid foundations in math/reading/writing, plus at least one area of deeper interest (STEM, humanities, arts, etc.).\n- Community fit: collaboration, reliability, and respect—our classes move fast and students often learn in teams.\n\nWhat helps students thrive here:\n- Strong time management (weekly planning, staying ahead on problem sets/reading).\n- Using support early (office hours, peer study groups) rather than waiting until exams.\n- Building fundamentals: daily practice in math and frequent writing with revision.\n\nTo best present your strengths, it helps to share concrete examples: a project you stuck with, how you improved after feedback, or a topic you pursued beyond class.\n\nA quick question so I can advise you better: what subjects are you strongest in right now, and what kind of rigor are you hoping for (e.g., advanced math/science, intensive writing, debate/research)? Also, where does School_A sit among your current top choices?",
