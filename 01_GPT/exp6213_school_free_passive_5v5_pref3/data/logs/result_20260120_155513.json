Our workload is manageable, but it rewards consistency.\n2) **Students who go deep in 1–2 activities:** the students who enjoy School_E most usually pick a “home base” (STEM build/comp teams, debate/writing, arts performance, or service leadership) and commit long enough to grow into leadership.\n3) **Collaborative, community-minded students:** because many projects are team-based, students who communicate well and follow through tend to stand out and feel supported.\n\n**First-year support in practice (what it actually looks like)**\n- **Start-of-year transition/onboarding:** early check-ins on schedule, workload, and routines; we try to catch misplacement or overload in the first few weeks rather than later.\n- **Dedicated advising:** you’re paired with an advisor who meets with you regularly early on (more frequent at the start, then tapering) to set goals, track grades/assignments, and troubleshoot time management.\n- **Academic support that’s easy to access:** teacher office hours + structured tutoring/peer support for core subjects, with extra attention during the first term when pacing can feel new.\n- **Progress monitoring:** if a student is slipping, we intervene quickly with a plan (study strategy adjustments, tutoring cadence, and advisor follow-ups) rather than waiting for end-of-term results.\n\nTo help you decide fit (and so I can be candid about whether we’re a strong match):\n1) What are your top 1–2 “anchor” interests you want to go deep on in high school?\n2) Where is School_E currently sitting in your ranking, and what would need to be true for us to move up (program, culture, support, competitiveness, etc.)?\n\nIf you tell me those, I can map you to specific pathways/clubs here and give you a realistic picture of what your first semester would feel like.\n\n[TALK]",
