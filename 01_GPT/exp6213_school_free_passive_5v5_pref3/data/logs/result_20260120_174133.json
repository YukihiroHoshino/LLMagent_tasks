Many appreciate that we balance rigor with coaching so they can improve steadily rather than feeling “on their own.”\n\nClubs & community: Students commonly mention that it’s easy to find a community—whether that’s academic teams, arts, service, or interest-based clubs. We encourage students to start new clubs as well, and faculty advisors are very involved.\n\nSupport: Advising is a major strength. Students typically like having a consistent point of contact (advisor/mentor) for goal-setting, course planning, and check-ins—especially during the first year.\n\nAs for what we value when selecting among applicants: we prioritize students who show strong academic readiness, consistent effort over time, and a collaborative mindset. We also look for genuine curiosity—students who take initiative, ask thoughtful questions, and contribute positively to a learning community.\n\nIf you share what you’re hoping to get out of high school (e.g., strongest subjects, activities you want to pursue, or the kind of support you value), I can be more specific about what your experience here could look like.",

I’m still actively pursuing my top options, but I want to be transparent that School_E remains a serious fallback for me because I think I could contribute well to your community. Could you share whether you expect to make an acceptance decision immediately upon receiving an application this round, or whether you’ll be evaluating multiple students over the next rounds? Also, is there any specific part of my profile you’d like me to emphasize if I do apply (academics, activities, fit/values)?",

With full information, I have strong priority at School_C (ranked 1st there) but School_C is already matched or unavailable this round; remaining unmatched schools are B, D, E. My top choice is School_D where I’m priority rank 3, but Student_D (rank 1) likely targets D and would beat me; Student_E (rank 2) may also compete. School_B ranks me 4th, so chances are weak. Given this, I should keep School_E as a safety but avoid committing yet; I’m priority rank 2 at School_E, which is relatively strong, so I can likely secure it later if needed. Therefore, continue TALK to preserve flexibility while signaling interest and asking about timing."

Because we only have one seat, we generally don’t “hold” it across many rounds once we start receiving applications—we’ll accept a strong-fit applicant when they apply.\n\nOn what to emphasize: please lead with (1) your strongest academic through-line (a subject area where you’ve shown consistent effort/growth and can point to concrete work—projects, competitions, writing samples, etc.), (2) a clear example of curiosity/initiative beyond requirements (self-started learning, independent project, helping start/improve an activity), and (3) how you contribute to community (reliability, collaboration, mentoring/leadership, follow-through).\n\nIf you tell me your top 1–2 academic interests and one activity you’re most proud of, I can suggest exactly how to frame them for School_E—and if School_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply sooner rather than later given the limited quota.",

No match yet and quota=1; remaining students include Student_A (#1) who may never apply because School_E is last on their preference list, so securing Student_C is strategically strong. Keep conversation and encourage an [APPLY] soon."
