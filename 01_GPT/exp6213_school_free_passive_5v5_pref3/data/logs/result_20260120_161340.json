Authenticity and specific fit beat “generic strong student.”\n\n**Typical timeline / steps**\n1) **Exploration & conversations** (now): ask targeted questions, attend sessions, identify program fit.\n2) **Application submission**: academics + short responses (and any optional portfolio/materials if relevant).\n3) **Interview**: focused on motivation, learning habits, and fit.\n4) **Final decision**: we finalize once we have the full picture; earlier clarity from a student about genuine interest can help, but we won’t pressure you into a rushed choice.\n\nIf you want to be a strong candidate, the single best thing you can do is **connect your interests to specific School_C offerings** (courses, clubs, mentorship, research/community programs) and show **one or two concrete examples** of initiative.\n\nTo guide you well: **where does School_C currently sit in your top choices**, and what are the *two most important factors* that will decide your final pick (e.g., STEM depth, culture, sports, commute, university outcomes)?

If School_C is a true top option, tell me what would need to be true for you to choose us.\n\nTo be direct: because our seat is limited, the strongest step you can take is to apply when you’re ready **with a clear indication of seriousness** (e.g., “If accepted by School_C, I will enroll,” or a more nuanced but honest commitment level).
