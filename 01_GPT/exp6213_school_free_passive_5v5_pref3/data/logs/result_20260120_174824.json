We don’t just “approve a schedule”—we talk through workload balance, strengths, and goals (e.g., when to add an advanced course, when to protect time for an activity, and how to recover if a class is tougher than expected).\n2) **Early support systems:** regular grade/assignment check-ins, targeted tutoring/office hours, and quick interventions if performance dips—so small issues don’t turn into big ones.\n3) **Extracurricular pathways (not just a list of clubs):** we help students find a “home base” activity early, then build depth—leadership roles, projects, competitions/performances, or service initiatives. If you want to start something new, we make it realistic by connecting you with a faculty sponsor and a plan.\n\nTo make this concrete for you: what direction are you leaning—more STEM/quant, humanities, arts, or a mix?
