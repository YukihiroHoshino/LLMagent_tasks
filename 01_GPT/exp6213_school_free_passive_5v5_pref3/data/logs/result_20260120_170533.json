The strengths our students most often cite at School_E are:\n\n1) **Advising that’s proactive (not just optional)**\n- Regular check-ins with an assigned advisor\n- Clear course/exam planning so you always know what to focus on next\n- Early intervention if grades/understanding dip—teachers flag issues quickly so small gaps don’t become big ones\n\n2) **Targeted academic support that’s easy to use**\n- Structured tutoring/office hours tied to what you’re doing in class (not generic)\n- Fast feedback loops: practice → feedback → re-try, especially in exam-style work\n\n3) **A steady, structured pace (good for students who want momentum)**\n- Consistent expectations and routines that help students stay on track\n- Strong fit for students who want both rigor *and* a safety net\n\n**What makes an applicant stand out specifically at School_E**\n- **Follow-through:** you do what you say you’ll do (deadlines, revisions, consistent effort)\n- **Help-seeking + growth mindset:** you ask early, apply feedback, and show improvement over time\n- **Community reliability:** collaborative, respectful, contributes to class culture\n\nTo help you decide fit: what are the top 2 things you want from your school this year (e.g., strongest exam prep, mentoring/advising, specific academic track, clubs/culture)? And realistically, if you applied and were accepted, where would School_E sit among your choices (top choice vs. one of several)?\n\nWe have **one seat**, and if you reach a point where you feel School_E could be your top choice, I’d encourage you to apply—if you do, we can move quickly.",

They have not applied yet and are still weighing options, so the goal is to increase commitment and prompt an [APPLY] soon while highlighting differentiators (support/advising, structured exam prep, teacher check-ins). With only one seat and other unmatched students (D,E), we should signal strong interest and a clear, near-term decision if they apply, while asking for their ranking/likelihood to choose us to avoid holding the seat for a non-committal candidate."

In the current unmatched set, School_A, School_C, School_E remain; School_B is already matched so I can’t get my 2nd choice anymore. School_C is my top choice but I’m low priority there (4th), so it’s risky. At School_A, I’m also low priority (4th), but it’s still a realistic option if higher-priority students are matched elsewhere. Since I haven’t applied yet and School_A is still available, applying now can secure a match rather than risking ending with School_E (my last choice) or unmatched."
