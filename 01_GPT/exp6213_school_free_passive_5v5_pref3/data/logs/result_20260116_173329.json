In close calls, a clear match to how we teach/support can be decisive.\n4) **Authenticity and clarity**: specific examples beat general claims (e.g., a concrete moment you struggled, what you did, and the result).\n\n**How to demonstrate interest appropriately:**\n- The best signal is a **thoughtful, timely application** plus (if available) attending an info session/tour and asking **specific questions** tied to your goals.\n- If you reach out, a short note that connects your interests to something concrete about School_E (a course pathway, advising/support structure, a club or project style) is ideal—no need for frequent messages.\n\n**Info sessions:**\nWe typically offer periodic virtual info sessions and student/parent Q&A.

I’m drawn to School_B for its academics and the chance to contribute consistently in class and in activities, and I’m prepared to commit promptly if offered a seat. If there’s anything you weight most in final decisions (academics, attendance/discipline record, activities, or overall fit), I’m happy to highlight those details right away.",
              "thought": "School_B is 4th on my true list, but remaining unmatched is worse than matching with B or E. I have only talked with School_B so far (no application), and School_B is still unmatched in round 7, so applying now can secure a seat before it fills. Also, School_B’s priority list ranks me 2nd (behind Student_D), which gives me a strong acceptance chance if Student_D chooses another school. Given my earlier applications to higher choices (C, D) with no acceptance yet, it’s strategically sound to apply to B now while signaling genuine interest and readiness to commit."

Student_D is my top choice but has only talked so far and may prefer School_C/A over B; waiting could leave me unmatched. Student_C already applied and was rejected; also ranks below A on my list.
