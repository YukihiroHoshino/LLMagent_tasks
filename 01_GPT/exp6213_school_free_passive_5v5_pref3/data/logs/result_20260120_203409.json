Support-wise, students commonly make use of structured teacher check-ins, peer study groups, and advising to stay on track during heavier weeks.\n\n**What to emphasize if you apply**:\n- 1–2 academic interests you’re genuinely excited about, plus *evidence* (a short example of what you did and what you learned).\n- One sustained commitment where you contributed consistently (club, sport, family responsibility, work, service) and what role you played.\n- The kind of learning environment you thrive in (structure vs flexibility, collaboration vs independent work) and how you’d engage here.\n\nTo tailor this to “a student like you,” can you share two quick things?\n1) What are your top 2 academic interests right now?\n2) Where does School_E currently sit on your preference list (roughly top choice / top 2–3 / mid / safety)?\n\n[TALK]",
