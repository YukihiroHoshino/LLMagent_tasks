Happy to share what students tend to value most about School_E.\n\nAcademics: We’re known for strong core instruction with accessible teacher support (regular office hours/tutorial blocks) and a culture where it’s normal to ask for help early. Students often mention that classes are challenging but well-scaffolded.\n\nClubs & activities: A big draw is that it’s easy to start something new—students who don’t see a club they want often create one with staff sponsorship. We also have a mix of academic teams, arts, and service-oriented groups, so different “types” of students find a home.\n\nSupport & culture: Students typically describe School_E as close-knit and collaborative rather than cutthroat. Advising/check-ins are a real part of the routine, and we try to make sure new students plug in quickly.\n\nWhat we value in applicants: We look for students who are curious, consistent in effort, and contribute positively to the community—things like sustained interest (in or out of school), initiative, and how you work with others. We also value students who will actually engage with what we offer (clubs, leadership, service, academic growth).\n\nTo get a better sense of fit: what are you most excited to pursue in high school (academically and outside class), and what kind of school environment helps you thrive?",
