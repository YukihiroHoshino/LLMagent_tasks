A common pattern is starting with a club, then spinning that into a deeper independent or team project.\n- **Community initiatives:** tutoring/peer-mentoring, local partnerships (service tied to real needs, not just hours), and student-led drives or workshops. We see a lot of “build something that lasts” efforts—systems, curricula, or ongoing programs.\n\n**Biggest strengths of the School_E experience**\n1) **Close advising + structured rigor:** students can pursue advanced coursework, but with regular check-ins and clear pathways so they don’t have to navigate everything alone.\n2) **Depth over résumé-padding:** we’re strongest when students want to go beyond participation into sustained mastery—turning interests into tangible outcomes (papers, prototypes, performances, competitions, or community programs).\n3) **Collaborative culture:** high expectations, but students tend to share resources, prep together, and support one another rather than compete in isolation.\n\n**When academics are similar, what becomes decisive**\n- **Evidence of sustained curiosity:** not just “I like X,” but “here’s what I built/read/studied/tried, and what I learned next.”\n- **Follow-through and reliability:** sticking with commitments, improving over time, and being someone others can count on.\n- **Fit with how we learn here:** students who want mentorship, feedback, and iterative improvement (drafting, revising, testing) tend to thrive.\n\nTo help you evaluate fit: **what are your top 1–2 interests right now (e.g., math/CS, research, debate, writing, service)**, and what would School_E need to offer for it to move higher on your list? Also, are you still in “exploring” mode, or are you getting close to submitting an application anywhere?",
