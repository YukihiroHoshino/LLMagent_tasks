We do still have a remaining seat and we are comparing candidates, so applying sooner helps ensure you’re fully considered while the seat is still open.\n\nIf you’re willing, send a quick 5–7 sentence snapshot so we can evaluate you properly:\n- strongest subject + evidence (coursework/results),\n- one sustained activity/service where you had clear impact,\n- 1–2 specific School_B offerings you’d pursue (clubs/courses) and what you’d contribute.\n\nIf you decide to apply this round, you can submit with [APPLY] and include that snapshot in the same message.",

Higher-priority Student_D is already matched elsewhere; Student_A (2nd) is still unmatched and may be reachable, but Student_A ranks us 4th so unlikely to apply soon. We have quota 1 and should keep flexibility while encouraging Student_C to apply now and signal what would make them competitive. Do not accept unless they apply. Continue talk and request specifics to assess fit; indicate seat is still open but competitive."

I’m ready to move forward: School_B is a top remaining choice for me, and I’m excited about the rigorous academics and the kind of community where I can contribute consistently through activities and service.

If helpful, I can briefly share my key academic interests and the extracurricular areas where I expect to contribute most at School_B.",
