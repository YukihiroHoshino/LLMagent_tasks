At round 3, only School_D and School_E remain unmatched, so my chances at higher-ranked remaining option (School_D) may be limited given School_D’s priorities put me last. School_E ranks me #1 in its priority list, so applying here likely secures a match and avoids going unmatched if School_D fills with someone else. Given the market is near the end and this is a safe option, I should apply now to lock in a match."
