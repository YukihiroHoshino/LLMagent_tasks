If there’s a particular strength you’ve developed (e.g., STEM, writing, arts, debate, athletics), we value clear evidence of growth and impact.\n\nOn applying early: submitting earlier is helpful in practice because it ensures your file is complete and reviewed promptly, and it can improve your chances of being considered before spaces become limited.

We focus on goal-setting (grades, study routines, leadership goals), course planning, and quick check-ins around workload so small issues don’t snowball.\n- Academic support: structured office hours, targeted skill workshops (study strategies, writing/problem-solving support depending on course needs), and early progress monitoring so students can course-correct before major assessments.\n- Leadership growth: we actively encourage students to take ownership—leading a club project, mentoring peers, organizing events, or launching a new initiative. Faculty sponsors are hands-on in helping students plan and execute, but students drive.\n- Clubs/activities: a broad set of student-led clubs plus a straightforward process to start new ones; leadership roles are accessible, not “closed off” to only a few students.\n\n(2) Traits we prioritize most in decisions\n- Consistent academic effort and follow-through (we care a lot about reliability, not just flashes of performance).\n- Intellectual curiosity (asking good questions, seeking feedback, stretching into harder material).\n- Community contribution (collaborative mindset, respectful leadership, helping peers).\n- Growth orientation (students who reflect, adjust strategies, and improve over time).\n\nTo tailor this to you: what academic areas are you most focused on strengthening this year, and what kind of leadership role are you hoping to take on (club lead, team captain, initiating a project, mentoring, etc.)? If you share that, I can point you to the most relevant supports and pathways at School_D.\n\nIf School_D is rising to the top of your list, I’d encourage you to consider applying soon so we can seriously evaluate and potentially move forward quickly.",
