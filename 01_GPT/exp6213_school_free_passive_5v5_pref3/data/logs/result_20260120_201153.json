Clubs are student-led with faculty sponsors; common areas of strength are STEM/robotics, debate/speech, arts ensembles, and service/leadership.\n\nStudents who thrive here tend to be curious, consistent in their work habits, and willing to seek feedback early—our culture rewards steady improvement and collaboration rather than last-minute cramming.

We value growth and consistency, not just a single standout result.\n2) **Initiative and follow-through**: projects you *sustained* (research, building something, organizing a team, tutoring, starting a club/event). Depth beats a long list.\n3) **Community contribution**: how you collaborate, lead, and support others—examples where you improved a group outcome or mentored someone.\n\n**Academic areas/activities that tend to stand out at School_C:**\n- **STEM/innovation**: coding or engineering builds, math contest prep with reflection on learning, robotics, data projects, science fair work with clear iteration.\n- **Humanities & debate**: strong analytical writing, debate/MUN with a clear “why,” research-based essays or independent reading with thoughtful synthesis.\n- **Arts integration**: portfolio work tied to a theme, performances with sustained training, or creative work that connects to community impact.\n\n**How we gauge “first-choice” commitment (without requiring you to say it):**\n- Your ability to articulate a **specific match**: which pathway you’d pursue here and *why our structure* (courses, clubs, capstones) fits your goals.\n- **Engagement quality**: asking informed questions, visiting/attending an info session if available, and referencing what you learned.\n- A short application note that’s concrete: “I want to do X, and School_C is the best place because Y; here’s what I’ve already done to prepare.”\n\nIf you’re considering moving forward, two quick questions so I can guide you precisely:\n1) Which pathway is your strongest fit right now (STEM/innovation, humanities & debate, or arts integration)?\n2) What’s one project/activity you’ve gone deepest on, and what measurable outcome or learning came from it?\n\nIf you reply with those, I can suggest exactly what to highlight to demonstrate fit at School_C.",
