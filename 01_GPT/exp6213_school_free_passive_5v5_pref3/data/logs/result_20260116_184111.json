Students can pursue advanced coursework with close teacher feedback rather than being “on their own.”\n\nStudent support: Each student is paired with an advisor who meets regularly on goal-setting, course planning, and wellbeing check-ins. We also run peer tutoring and teacher office hours that are easy to access (not just for students who are struggling—also for students aiming high).\n\nExtracurriculars: A lot of students plug into academic clubs (science/tech, debate, research), arts groups, and service leadership. We encourage students to build depth—one or two areas where they can grow into leadership—rather than spreading thin.\n\nWho thrives here: Students who are curious, proactive about asking questions, and like a community where teachers know them well. If you enjoy pushing yourself academically but also want consistent guidance and a supportive peer culture, you’ll likely fit well.\n\nTo help me be specific: what are your top priorities right now—STEM depth, humanities/writing, competitions, arts, college counseling/advising, or something else?
