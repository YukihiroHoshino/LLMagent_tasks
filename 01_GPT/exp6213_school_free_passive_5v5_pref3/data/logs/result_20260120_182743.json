Support is structured and easy to access: regular teacher office hours, peer tutoring/study groups, and advisor check-ins early in the year to help you settle in academically and socially.\n\n**Opportunities that are accessible to new students:** First-years can join most clubs immediately, and many groups intentionally recruit new students for committees and project teams. For leadership, we encourage “entry-point” roles (event teams, outreach, project leads) that don’t require prior tenure. For research/independent projects, the most common path is starting through a club or a faculty-mentored project—students who show initiative can often begin in their first year.\n\n**What we value in applicants:** Consistent academic effort, curiosity, and follow-through; positive community engagement (clubs/teams/service or meaningful responsibilities outside school); and evidence of a collaborative, respectful mindset. We also pay attention to whether a student can articulate what they’re looking for and how they’d contribute here.\n\nTo help you judge fit: what kinds of classes or activities energize you most (e.g., STEM/humanities, team-based projects, debate, arts, service)?

We also support students pursuing specialized programs when there’s a strong fit.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: **what are the “couple options” you’re deciding between, and what criteria matter most** (advanced academics, specific clubs, support structure, university outcomes, commute/culture)? If you tell me your priorities, I can map them directly to what School_D offers and suggest the most relevant first-year pathways.\n\nAlso—if School_D is a serious contender, when do you think you’d be able to submit a formal application? That timing helps us advise you appropriately.\n\n[TALK]",
