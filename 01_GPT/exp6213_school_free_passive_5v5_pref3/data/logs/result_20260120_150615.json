Students who thrive are supportive peers, comfortable asking for help, and willing to lead without needing the spotlight.\n\n**What distinguishes School_E**\n- We put a lot of emphasis on **student initiative**: independent projects, competitions, research-style work, community impact, and leadership that produces real outcomes.\n- Strong **academic community**: peer-to-peer learning is a big part of the experience (study circles, tutoring culture, club-led workshops).\n\n**How we compare strong applicants (what matters most)**\nWhen many applicants look “good on paper,” we focus on:\n1) **Trajectory + consistency** (steady growth and reliability, not just one standout moment)\n2) **Evidence of initiative** (did you create/drive something?)\n3) **Fit and clarity of purpose** (can you articulate what you want to pursue and why School_E supports it?)\n4) **Contribution to community** (how you collaborate, lead, and elevate others)\n\nTo help you assess fit honestly: what are your **top 2–3 schools right now**, and what would School_E need to offer (academically or in activities) to move into that top tier for you?
