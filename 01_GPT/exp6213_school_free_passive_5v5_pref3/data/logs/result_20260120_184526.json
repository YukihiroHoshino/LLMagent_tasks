Given Student_E states School_C is their first choice and will commit, the offer is credible and secures enrollment; also Student_C prefers School_D and Student_B prefers School_B, making it less likely we land our top two.

We also look for students who seek challenge but will ask for help early—because we’re strong on structured academic support.\n\nOur strengths include:\n- Rigorous core academics with clear pathways to advanced coursework.\n- Targeted support: teacher office hours, tutoring/peer study groups, and advisor check-ins to keep students on track.\n- Strong STEM and humanities offerings with project-based opportunities and competition/research options depending on interest.\n\nTo help you judge fit: what are you hoping to prioritize in high school (e.g., advanced courses, STEM vs. humanities, clubs/arts/athletics, or more individualized support)? And what kind of learning environment helps you thrive?\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re looking for, we’d be excited to see an application from you in an upcoming round.",
