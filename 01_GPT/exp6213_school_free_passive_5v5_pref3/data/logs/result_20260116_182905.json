Our goal is to make a final decision within the next couple of rounds (as soon as we have a clear view of who is actively applying).\n\nIf School_D is truly a top choice for you and you want to be considered immediately, please send an [APPLY] message in your next contact so we can treat it as an active application for this round’s decision-making. Also, if there’s anything specific you’re prioritizing (e.g., math/science rigor, study support, university guidance), tell me—those details help us assess fit quickly.\n\nI’m glad to keep the conversation going while we finalize.
