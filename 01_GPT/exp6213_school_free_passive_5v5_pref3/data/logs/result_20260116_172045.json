If you’re comfortable sharing, I can also suggest which parts of your profile to emphasize most strongly for our program.\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "As School_E, my true priority list ranks Student_D last (A, C, B, E, D). Remaining unmatched students are A, D, E; I prefer A or C most, and E over D. With quota 1, I should keep Student_D engaged but avoid any commitment; I cannot accept unless they apply, and even then would prefer to reject if I expect a chance at A or E. Student_D has School_E as 4th choice, so they are unlikely to apply early. Best move: provide helpful info, ask where we stand on their list and whether they’d apply if we signal strong interest, while subtly not overcommitting."

After learning more, I’m confident School_D would be a great fit for me, and I’d like to be considered seriously for your available seat. I’m ready to commit to School_D if accepted and would be excited to contribute to your community. Thank you for your consideration.",

School_D is still available and I have strong priority there (2nd), so applying now maximizes my chance to secure a reasonably preferred match before seats fill. I previously only talked to School_D, not applied."

Student_E is applying now and states readiness to commit, so accepting secures a top-choice student. Waiting for Student_D (#1) is risky because Student_D ranks School_D last and is unlikely to apply; Student_C (who ranks us #1) is already matched elsewhere per current unmatched list. Therefore, accept Student_E immediately to maximize outcome within quota."

Based on our review and our conversation, we believe you’re a strong fit for School_E’s academic expectations and community culture, especially given your emphasis on reliability, consistent contribution, and growth.\n\nFor final selection, the traits we weigh most are (1) sustained academic effort and readiness, (2) intellectual curiosity and willingness to seek feedback, and (3) character—follow-through, collaboration, and respect for others. Your message aligns well with these.\n\nWe’re happy to offer you admission to School_E. If you accept, we’ll look forward to having you join and get involved early in the year through classes and at least one sustained activity or club commitment.\n\n[ACCEPT]",

However, Student_D is on our true priority list but ranked last; still acceptable since list includes them and leaving unfilled is worse if no higher-priority student is available. Given the market state, accepting secures a filled seat and ends uncertainty. Student_D also signals commitment and fit with our stated values, so accept and set expectations."
