              "thought": "School_C is 4th on my true list (D, A, B, C, E). Still acceptable, but I should try for higher-ranked School_D first if possible. However, in the current unmatched set (C, D, E) and with only one seat each, there is risk I miss out if I wait too long. Importantly, School_C ranks me #1 in its priority list, so if I apply now I should be accepted and secure a match. Given that A and B are already matched, my realistic best remaining option is School_D, but School_D prioritizes D and E above me, so I may lose there. Therefore, locking in School_C now guarantees a decent outcome versus gambling for D and ending up at E or unmatched."
