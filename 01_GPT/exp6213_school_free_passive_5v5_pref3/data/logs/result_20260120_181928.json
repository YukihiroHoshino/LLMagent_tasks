If we receive an early application from a student we rate highly (and you are in that category), and they communicate that School_E is a serious option, we’re much more likely to move quickly rather than “wait and see.”\n- Practically: we won’t promise to hold the seat indefinitely without an application, because with quota 1 we have to manage risk. But if you’re genuinely considering School_E, an **early, clear signal** (and especially an application) meaningfully improves the chance we can commit to you rather than holding out for uncertain outcomes.\n\nTo be transparent from our side: **you are someone we would be excited to enroll**, and if School_E is even a plausible top choice for you, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready.\n\nWhat would help you decide whether School_E should move up your list—specific programs (STEM/humanities), culture, advising structure, or something else you’re comparing across schools?",

Student_C’s preferences place School_E last, so we need to increase perceived fit and reduce uncertainty. Since Student_C is only [TALK], we cannot accept/reject; we should answer priorities and give a clear, strategic signal: strong interest, early application helps, and we do consider demonstrated interest/fit when deciding whether to commit, but we cannot guarantee holding a seat without an application. Encourage Student_C to apply if genuinely considering us, and ask what would move School_E up their list."

              "thought": "Only School_E remains unmatched in round 7, so applying now secures a match rather than risking ending unmatched. School_E is on my preference list (though last), and School_E ranks me #1 in its priority list, so acceptance is very likely. With no higher-ranked schools available, it’s optimal to apply and lock in the seat."
