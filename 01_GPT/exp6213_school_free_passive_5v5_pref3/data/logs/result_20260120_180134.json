Activities matter here, but we see them as an extension of learning—clubs and competitions are well-supported, and we encourage students to take leadership or build something tangible over time.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what subjects energize you most, and are you looking more for (1) advanced academic challenge, (2) a tight extracurricular community, or (3) a specific track (e.g., STEM research, debate/humanities, arts)? If you share that, I can point you to the parts of School_C that align best.",

We also value students who can explain *why* our program fits their goals, not just list it.\n\nWith only one seat, we do have to be selective, but I can say you would be a very realistic candidate for us if you decide to apply—especially if you can articulate what you’re looking for and how you’d contribute here. If School_B is a serious option for you, applying earlier rather than later can matter in a market like this.\n\nWhat are you most interested in (STEM, humanities, arts, leadership, etc.), and what kind of school environment helps you thrive?
