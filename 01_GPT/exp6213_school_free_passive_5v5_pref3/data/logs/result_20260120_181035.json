If you’re the kind of student who wants both academic rigor and a community where people actually help each other improve, that’s a strong fit.\n\nTo help you compare schools: what are the top 2–3 factors you’re prioritizing (e.g., STEM depth, humanities, arts, athletics, college counseling, school culture/competitiveness, commute)?
