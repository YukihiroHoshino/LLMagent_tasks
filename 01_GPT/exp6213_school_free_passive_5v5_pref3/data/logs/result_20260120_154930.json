We’ve had exploratory conversations with a couple students, but we have not accepted anyone yet.\n\nTo understand whether School_E should be a stronger option for you: what are your top 1–2 academic interests, and what would you want from a school (support style, culture, opportunities) that you’re not getting elsewhere?
