We will prioritize students who show **academic readiness**, **follow-through/initiative**, and a **clear fit** with our project-and-community culture. If you can articulate how you’d use our opportunities (projects, leadership, sustained involvement), that’s the strongest signal.\n\n2) **Will we make/hold an offer quickly?** Yes—because we have **only one seat**, if we receive an application that’s a strong fit, we’re prepared to **move quickly** rather than wait. And if we accept someone, we intend that to be a firm commitment on our side (i.e., we won’t keep shopping after offering).\n\nIf School_E is genuinely one of your top options and you’d like to keep the door open before the seat is taken, I’d encourage you to **apply this round**.\n\nIf you want, send 2–3 bullets now on (a) your top academic interests and (b) one activity/project you’ve stuck with or want to develop seriously—I can tell you candidly whether it sounds like the kind of fit we’re likely to act on quickly.",
