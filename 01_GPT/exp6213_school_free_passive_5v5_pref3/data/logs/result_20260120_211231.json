If after that you feel aligned, applying sooner rather than later is beneficial in a fast-moving market.\n\nWhat are your top 2–3 priorities in a school, and what’s one area you’re most excited to grow in over the next four years?",

It’s rigorous, but designed to be manageable with good routines rather than last-minute cramming.\n- Clear structure: teachers post expectations early, and many courses use check-ins so you know where you stand before major exams.\n- Support that’s actually used: scheduled extra-help/office hours, peer study groups, and advisor check-ins—especially around exam weeks.\n\nActivities and student life:\n- Students who do best in activities are the ones who commit and show up consistently—whether that’s a club, team, music, service, or academic competitions.\n- We value balance: it’s common for students to do 1–2 main activities seriously rather than trying to do everything.\n- Community culture is collaborative; students tend to help each other prepare and improve, not just compete.\n\nIf admitted, the qualities I’d most hope to see from you as a School_D student are:\n- Reliability (meeting commitments, being prepared)\n- Initiative (seeking challenges, starting/leading something you care about)\n- Growth mindset (using feedback, bouncing back from setbacks)\n- Positive citizenship (respectful, collaborative, contributing to the community)\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you more specifically:\n1) Where is School_D currently on your list (top choice, top 2–3, etc.)?\n2) What are you most excited to pursue here—any subjects or activities you’d want to lean into?\n\nIf School_D is near the top, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—we’d be genuinely excited to see your application and learn what you’d contribute.",

When a student applies, we can accept immediately if we’re confident on fit and intent, but we have only 1 seat—so we prioritize applicants who show clear likelihood of enrolling.\n- Practically, earlier strong applications are advantaged because our seat can be filled at any time.\n\nTo be respectful of your intentions: where is School_E currently on your list (roughly), and what are the 2–3 most important things you want from your high school? If School_E is a school you would seriously choose, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel ready (even as early as next round), and tell us what makes it your fit—this helps us move quickly on our side.",
