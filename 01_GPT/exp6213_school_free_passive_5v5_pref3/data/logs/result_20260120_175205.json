Rigor matters, but so does how you handle challenge.\n- Thinking and communication: In interviews/conversations and written components, top applicants explain their reasoning clearly, ask sharp questions, and can reflect on mistakes and learning.\n- Initiative and follow-through (activities): Depth beats breadth. We’re most impressed by students who commit to a few interests (academic, creative, service, leadership, competitions) and can point to tangible outcomes—projects built, teams led, results improved, people helped.\n- Fit with our learning culture: Collaboration and reliability are big. Students who elevate peers, contribute in discussions, and take feedback well tend to rise on our list.\n\nWhat a successful first-year student at School_C looks like:\n- Uses structure well: keeps up with demanding coursework by planning ahead and seeking help early (advising/office hours).\n- Engages actively: participates in discussion, presents ideas, and is comfortable revising work after critique.\n- Balanced but ambitious: sets high goals, but manages workload sustainably and stays consistent week-to-week.\n- Builds community: joins at least one meaningful club/team or project group and contributes steadily.\n\nTo make this concrete for you: what are 1–2 areas you’re strongest in right now (e.g., math/science, writing, debate, leadership, coding, arts), and what kind of environment helps you thrive (high structure vs. high independence)?

Then I can point you to the most relevant parts of School_E and be transparent about fit.\n\nIf you’re open to it, answer these two quick questions and I’ll respond with a tailored assessment:\n1) What are your top 2 academic interests right now?\n2) What’s one activity/project you’ve stuck with the longest, and what role did you play?\n\nIf after that you feel School_E could be a top option, applying soon is the clearest signal—and we will treat it seriously right away.",

Given School_B’s priority list ranks me last, they likely preferred others but those students are already matched elsewhere, so School_B may now have no better option and should accept to fill capacity. Provide a final clear commitment and ask for a definitive decision this round."
