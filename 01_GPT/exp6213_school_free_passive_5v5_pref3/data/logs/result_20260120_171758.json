In particular:\n- **Consistency + follow-through:** sustained effort over time, meeting commitments, and finishing what you start.\n- **Initiative and depth:** taking an interest beyond the minimum (e.g., independent projects, deeper reading, leadership/ownership in an activity, or measurable growth).\n- **Coachability and help-seeking:** students who reflect, use feedback, and proactively access support—this predicts success here.\n- **Community impact:** collaboration, reliability, and making teams/classes better (we pay attention to this because it shapes the learning environment).\n\n(2) Academic tracks/support programs new students most often take advantage of:\n- **Honors/advanced pathways (by subject):** many students start with 1–2 honors courses and scale up as they find the right balance.\n- **Advisory + academic coaching:** structured check-ins early in the year (goal-setting, planning systems, study strategies). This is especially popular with new students adjusting to workload.\n- **Small-group support / office-hour model:** targeted help in math, writing, and organization—students use it both for catching up and for pushing ahead.\n- **Early enrichment options:** academic teams, research/innovation-style projects, and leadership roles that are accessible to 9th/10th graders (not “wait until junior year”).\n\nTo help you judge fit quickly: what are your top 2 academic interests, and do you prefer a more collaborative environment or a more competitive one? Also—where does School_E currently sit on your shortlist (top choice, top 2–3, or still exploring)? If we’re a serious contender for you, I’d encourage you to apply this cycle so we can move from exploration to a concrete next step.",

Since this is the last chance to finalize, can you please make a final decision on my existing application now?
