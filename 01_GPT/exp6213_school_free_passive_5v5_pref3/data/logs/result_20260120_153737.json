We appreciate your clear interest in School_A’s rigorous academics and your commitment to contributing positively to our community.\n\nWe’re pleased to offer you admission to School_A. If you’re ready to finalize, please confirm that you will enroll, and we’ll share the next steps and timeline for onboarding and course placement.",

Remaining unmatched students are Student_A and Student_E; Student_A is ranked higher (3rd) but we have no current application from them and only one seat. Given Student_E is on our list and is applying with commitment, accepting now secures a match rather than risking ending unmatched if Student_A matches elsewhere or never applies. Accept Student_E."
