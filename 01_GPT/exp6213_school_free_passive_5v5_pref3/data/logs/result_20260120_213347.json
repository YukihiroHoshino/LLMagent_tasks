Since this is the final round, I want to state plainly: School_C is my #1 choice, and if you extend the offer to me, I will accept immediately and finalize enrollment today (and withdraw from any other possibilities).\n\nCan you please confirm right now whether you are able to issue the acceptance to me in this round? If there is a single remaining item you need from me to finalize (confirmation form, short goals/fit paragraph, activities list, etc.), tell me exactly what it is and I will send it immediately.",

Given it’s round 30 and no other schools remain, the best move is a final, direct commitment/availability signal and ask for immediate closure, while using [TALK]."
