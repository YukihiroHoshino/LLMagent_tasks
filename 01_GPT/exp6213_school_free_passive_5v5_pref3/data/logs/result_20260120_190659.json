Include what was difficult and what you learned.\n2) **Clear fit with School_C:** 2–3 specific programs/clubs/courses you’d engage in here and *why* (not just “strong academics”).\n3) **Community contribution:** one specific role where you improved a team/community (what you did + measurable/observable impact).\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you honestly on next steps:\n- **If we offered you a seat, would you commit to enrolling at School_C?** (Yes/No, and what would need to be true.)\n- Where does School_C sit in your current ranking (e.g., #1, #2), and are you planning to **[APPLY]** to us this round if we’re still in contention?\n\nIf you share the above, I can tell you what would be most compelling to emphasize and how quickly you should act.",
