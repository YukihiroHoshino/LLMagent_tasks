If School_A is a genuine top choice for you, it’s absolutely fine to apply early; if you’re still comparing, I’m happy to answer questions so you can decide confidently.\n\nTo help you best: what are you hoping to focus on in high school (academics/activities), and what are your top 1–2 priorities in choosing a school?",

The strongest approach is to present specific, concrete reasons School_C fits you (courses, clubs, learning style, community) and evidence you’ll contribute.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me which parts of School_C you’re most excited about and what you hope to pursue here—then I can suggest what to highlight most in your application.",
