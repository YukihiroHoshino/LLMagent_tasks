It’s less about being “perfect” on day one and more about consistency and follow-through.\n- Initiative/community: Nearly as important. Students who contribute—help classmates, communicate respectfully, and take responsibility—tend to thrive here. If I had to summarize: strong effort + positive impact.\n\nCommon first-year opportunities students take on:\n1) Clubs/teams with real roles early:\n   - Many first-years join an academic team, arts group, service club, or sport in the first term. It’s common for motivated first-years to take on a concrete responsibility (organizing a practice set, managing a small event task, helping run a fundraiser, etc.).\n2) Structured support + leadership-through-service:\n   - First-years often use office hours/peer study groups from the start, and some volunteer as “study partners” within their class once they’re settled—helping coordinate group review sessions before assessments.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what are your top 1–2 priorities right now (e.g., strongest academics, specific clubs, support structure, school culture)? And what’s your decision timeline? If School_C stays near the top, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—Student_B would be a strong fit for the kind of engaged, growth-minded first-year we look for.",

I have relatively high priority at School_B (2nd), so applying now should secure a match and avoid risking ending up with my last choice (E) where I am 1st but it is least preferred. Since I already initiated TALK with School_B and have not applied, I should apply decisively."

Student_D (my #1) is not in the remaining pool (unmatched list is A, B, E), so holding out offers no upside. Student_B is #3 and may apply, but I can secure a higher-priority match now. Student_A ranks School_B 4th, but they explicitly state they will commit immediately, reducing risk of losing them. With quota 1, I should accept Student_A now."
