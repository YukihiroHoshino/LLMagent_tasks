We appreciate your focus on consistent academic effort and community contribution—those align closely with what helps students thrive at School_E.\n\nWe’re happy to offer you admission. If you join us, we’ll connect you with an advisor early to map out your academic goals and the activities you’d like to get involved in.\n\nWelcome to School_E.",
              "thought": "Student_D is last on School_E’s true priority list, but still acceptable. With quota 1 and only Student_B and Student_D unmatched, waiting could risk ending with no match if Student_B matches elsewhere; however Student_B is ranked higher than Student_D. Student_B has not applied and prefers School_E 4th; Student_D prefers School_E 4th as well but is applying now and signals commitment. Given the rules, accepting now secures a match rather than risking an unfilled seat; Student_D is on the acceptable list, so accept."
