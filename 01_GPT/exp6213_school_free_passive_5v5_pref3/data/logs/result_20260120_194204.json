I’m ready to finalize immediately: if you offer me the seat right now, I will accept instantly and withdraw from all other options the same round.

Best move is a final, clear commitment and request to finalize immediately, using [TALK]."

If you send an [APPLY] (one line is enough) in the next exchange while paired with us—e.g., “School_A is my #1; I will accept immediately and withdraw from all other options this round.”—we will respond with [ACCEPT] immediately.",

However, the student’s tag is [TALK], so by the rules we cannot issue a formal offer unless they send [APPLY].
