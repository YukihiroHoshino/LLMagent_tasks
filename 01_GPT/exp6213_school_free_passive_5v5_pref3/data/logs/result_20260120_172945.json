Strong teacher recommendations and a clear sense of what you want to pursue here also matter a lot.\n\nOn your question about “how many applicants are ahead of you”: we don’t share an exact priority position or a live ranking, because it can shift based on fit and the overall pool.

School_E is on my preference list (last), and being unmatched is worse than matching with School_E. Also, School_E ranks Student_A first in its priority list, so an application should be accepted immediately. Given the market is about to end with remaining agents matching, I should apply now to secure a match rather than risk remaining unmatched."
