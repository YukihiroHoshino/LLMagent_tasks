The workload is very manageable if you keep a weekly rhythm (planning, starting assignments early, asking for help quickly).\n- **Students who like discussion + application.** Many classes blend direct instruction with seminars, projects, presentations, and frequent feedback.\n- **Growth-minded learners.** You don’t need to be perfect; you do need to be willing to revise work, reflect, and iterate.\n\n**Community expectations:**\n- **Respectful, collaborative culture**—students are expected to contribute in class and in group work.\n- **Ownership and integrity**—we care a lot about follow-through, academic honesty, and being someone others can rely on.\n- **Use support early**—advisory/mentoring isn’t “only if you’re struggling”; strong students use it to set goals and stretch.\n\n**Signature tracks/clubs/mentorship to join early (if admitted):**\n- **Advisory + faculty mentorship:** we match students with an advisor and encourage early goal-setting (academics + activities + wellbeing). If you tell us your interests, we can connect you to a teacher mentor quickly.\n- **Project/presentation-based pathways:** students often choose an early focus (e.g., STEM/innovation, humanities & communication, social impact) and build a portfolio over time.\n- **Clubs with strong on-ramps for new students:** student leadership/committee roles, academic teams, service initiatives, and maker/project groups—these are designed so 9th/10th graders can take real responsibility.\n\nTo recommend the *best* early on-ramp for you: **what are your top 2–3 academic interests right now**, and do you prefer a **more structured** environment or **more independence**?

Students who like seeing “why it works,” not just memorizing steps, tend to do very well.\n- **Writing and communication across subjects:** Even in STEM and social studies, we build structured writing, revision, and presentation skills—helpful for high school and beyond.\n- **Flexible pacing with clear support:** We offer both advanced pathways and structured support (office hours/tutoring, check-ins, and proactive outreach) so students can stretch without getting lost.\n\n**Students who thrive in our community**\n- **Consistent follow-through:** Students who keep steady habits and use feedback to improve.\n- **Curiosity + initiative:** Those who ask questions, explore beyond the assignment, or start/join projects and clubs.\n- **Community-minded teammates:** Students who collaborate well, communicate respectfully, and contribute to a positive culture.\n\nTo help you decide fit quickly: what are your top 2–3 factors right now (e.g., academic rigor, specific subjects, clubs/arts/athletics, support, campus culture)?
