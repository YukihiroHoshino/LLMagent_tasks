Based on your application this round, School_B is pleased to offer you admission—if you enroll, we’re confident you’ll thrive in our rigorous, community-focused first-year experience. Welcome to School_B.",

With quota 1 and only Student_A and Student_E remaining unmatched, accepting Student_A secures a very high-priority match. Student_E is last on our list, so waiting risks ending with a lower-priority student or no match. Student_A also offers a credible commitment to enroll, reducing risk. Therefore accept immediately."
