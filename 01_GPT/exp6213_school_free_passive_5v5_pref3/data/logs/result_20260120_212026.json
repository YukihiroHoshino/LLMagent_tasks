The ones who do best here usually balance independence with being a reliable teammate in group work and clubs.\n\n**Areas/clubs we’re especially strong in**\n- **STEM and problem-solving** (math/science enrichment, project-based work)\n- **Academic clubs** that reward sustained practice (e.g., competition-style or research/project-oriented groups)\n- **Student-led initiatives** (students who propose and run projects tend to find a lot of support)\n\nTo help you assess fit quickly: what subjects energize you most, and what’s one activity/project you’ve stuck with for a while?

That said, **clear, specific interest** can help at the margin—especially when applicants are academically similar—because it signals you’ve thought about what you’d contribute and why our program matches your goals.\n\n**What most influences the final decision**\n1) **Academic readiness** (grades + course rigor + consistency): this is the main foundation.\n2) **Assessment/entrance exam performance** (if applicable): used to confirm placement and distinguish among strong candidates.\n3) **Activities + character**: often the differentiator—depth over breadth, sustained commitment, initiative/leadership, and follow-through. We also look for collaboration and reliability, since our classes and projects are interactive.\n\n**Who tends to thrive here**\nStudents who do best are steady with weekly workload, comfortable asking for feedback early, and genuinely curious—especially if they like project-based learning and building strong study routines.\n\nIf you’re deciding whether to submit an application, two quick questions will help me give you an honest read on fit:\n1) Where does **School_E** sit on your current list (top choice / top 3 / still unsure)?\n2) What’s one academic area or activity you’ve gone deepest on (and what outcome you’re proud of)?\n\nIf you share those, I can point you to the track/club/support at School_E that matches you best and tell you what would strengthen an application here.",
