We also offer guidance on study routines, time management, and transitioning into high school expectations.\n\nOn extracurriculars: we encourage students to join at least one club/team; options typically include academic clubs, arts/music, student leadership, and sports. We also support students who want to start a new club if there’s interest.\n\nWhat we particularly value in applicants: consistent effort and improvement over time, intellectual curiosity (asking questions, exploring interests), reliability/character (showing up, following through), and contribution to community (teamwork, leadership, or service). If you have a specific academic interest (STEM, humanities, arts, etc.), sharing concrete examples of projects or sustained involvement helps.\n\nIf you tell me what areas you’re most interested in (e.g., STEM, arts, athletics, leadership) and what kind of support matters most to you, I can point you to the most relevant programs and opportunities at School_E.",
