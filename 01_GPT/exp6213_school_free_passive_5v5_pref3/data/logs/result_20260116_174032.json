Because we have limited seats, we tend to move quickly when we find a strong match.\n\nOn applicant profiles: we’re especially excited by students who (1) show sustained academic curiosity and follow-through, (2) are collaborative—raising the level of peers rather than only competing, and (3) can point to one or two areas they’re eager to develop deeply (STEM research, humanities writing, entrepreneurship, arts, etc.).\n\nRegarding Student_C: I can’t comment on any individual student’s plans or whether we “expect” an application from a particular person. What I can say is that we evaluate each student on their own merits, and timing does matter in a small-seat environment.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn a bit more about you so I can be concrete: what subjects/activities are you most excited to pursue in high school, and what kind of learning environment helps you thrive (highly structured vs. more independent, collaborative vs. competitive)?",

However, Student_B’s own preferences rank School_C last, so they may be unlikely to apply unless persuaded.
