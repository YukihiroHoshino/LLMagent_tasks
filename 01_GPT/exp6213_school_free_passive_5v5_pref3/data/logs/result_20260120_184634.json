Students who use these consistently tend to improve quickly.\n- **Early feedback:** We emphasize frequent, low-stakes assessments so students can adjust early rather than discovering gaps at the end of a term.\n\n(2) When seats are limited, what we value most:\n- **Academic readiness and consistency** (steady effort over time, not just one strong result).\n- **Responsiveness to feedback** (students who actively use office hours/tutoring and show growth).\n- **Fit with our culture** of structured work habits and collaboration.\n\nFrom what you’ve shared—wanting rigor *and* consistent support—you sound like an excellent fit here.
