I’ll be very direct about what we value most and what “fit” looks like at School_D.\n\n**Top qualities we prioritize (in roughly this order):**\n1) **Academic readiness + habits**: not just grades, but evidence of consistency—meeting deadlines, revising work, and steadily improving.\n2) **Character and community impact**: integrity, respect, and a track record of being a positive teammate (clubs, group projects, helping others).\n3) **Curiosity and initiative**: students who ask good questions, pursue interests beyond what’s required, and take ownership of learning.\n4) **Resilience / growth mindset**: how you respond when something is hard—seeking feedback, using support blocks, and persisting.\n5) **Clear goals for high school**: you don’t need a perfect “career plan,” but we like students who can articulate what they want to explore and why.\n\n**Programs/experiences that best represent School_D:**\n- **Advisory + goal planning** (ongoing check-ins and individualized course/enrichment planning)\n- **Structured support blocks** (office hours, tutoring, study groups built into the schedule)\n- **Discussion-based, writing- and project-centered classes** (students who like to think out loud and revise tend to thrive)\n- **Student-led community culture** (peer tutoring, mentoring, and clubs that are genuinely student-driven)\n\n**How to align your application (practical tips):**\n- Share 1–2 concrete examples where you **improved through feedback** or overcame a challenge.\n- Highlight a time you **contributed to a community** (team, class, club, family responsibilities) and what you learned.\n- Tell us what you’d be excited to do here—e.g., a club you’d start/join, a project you’d pursue, or an academic area you want to deepen.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, I’d love to learn: **what’s one academic area you feel most energized by, and what kind of school environment helps you do your best work (more collaborative, more competitive, more structured, etc.)?**\n\n[TALK]",
