Two quick questions:\n1) Where does School_A currently sit in your ranking (e.g., 1st/2nd/3rd)?\n2) What’s one academic or extracurricular area you’re most excited to pursue here, and why?\n\nIf School_A is truly near the top for you, I’d encourage you to submit a formal application when you’re ready—demonstrated commitment and clear fit matter in our decisions.",
