I already applied to School_B earlier, but School_B’s priority list ranks me last, so my chance there is weak if any other student applies. School_E’s priority ranks me 4th; still not great, but with others likely matched already, I may be competitive. I previously only talked to School_E and have not applied yet, so I should apply now and signal commitment to lock in a seat."

If you’re able, please reply with (1) your primary academic interests you want to pursue here (STEM/humanities/arts), and (2) one activity or responsibility where you’ve shown the most follow-through—so we can start thinking about the best initial advising and club/course placements for you.\n\nWelcome to School_E.",

Only Student_B and Student_E remain unmatched; Student_B is ranked higher (3rd) but is not applying to me this round. With quota 1, accepting Student_E now secures an acceptable match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if Student_B matches elsewhere or never applies. Student_E also signals strong commitment to enroll if admitted, increasing match stability. Therefore accept Student_E."
