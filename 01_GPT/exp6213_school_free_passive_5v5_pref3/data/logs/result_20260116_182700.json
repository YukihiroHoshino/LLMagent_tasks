I’m ready to commit and would be excited to contribute positively in class and in school activities. If you still have an open seat, I’d like to formally apply and be considered this round.",
              "thought": "School_E is my last choice, but it is still on my acceptable list. By round 3, only School_D and School_E remain unmatched, so my higher options (School_C/B/A) are likely already filled. To avoid ending up unmatched, I should apply to School_E now. School_E’s priority ranks me 4th (ahead of Student_D), so I have a reasonable chance if they still have capacity."

We do still have an open seat, and based on what you’ve shared about wanting to contribute to our community and engage fully, we’d be excited to move forward.\n\nIf you match with School_E, we’ll look for you to follow through on that commitment—show up consistently, participate, and take ownership of at least one activity or project you care about.\n\nWelcome to School_E.",
              "thought": "As School_E with quota 1, my true priority list ranks Student_E 4th (above Student_D but below A/C/B). In the current market, only Student_C and Student_E remain unmatched. Student_C is higher on my list, but Student_C’s preference list places School_E last, making it unlikely they will apply here unless forced. Student_E is actively applying now, and accepting secures a match rather than risking ending unfilled. Student_E is on my priority list, so acceptance is permissible and strategically prudent."
