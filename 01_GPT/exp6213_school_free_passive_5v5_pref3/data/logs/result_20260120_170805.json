A thoughtful note about what you want to pursue here and how you’ve prepared is especially helpful.\n\nOn your question about whether we’re leaning toward particular students: we’re actively speaking with a few candidates, but with only one seat we’ll move quickly when a student is confident School_D is a top choice. If School_D is truly one of your top options, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—your interest and fit come through clearly.",

Student_B’s first choice is School_B and Student_D’s first choice is School_C, so they may not apply to us early; but if they are rejected elsewhere they could come to us.
