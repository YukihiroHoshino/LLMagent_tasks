In the final round, the best move is to stay engaged without re-applying into a closed seat, and to provide the exact structured info Company_E requested (req IDs/links + email + keywords + fit one-liner + any deadline). Since I don’t have actual req IDs in the prompt, I will (a) confirm I’m submitting today, (b) commit to sending the req IDs immediately after submission, and (c) provide the keywords/fit one-liner template so they can act fast once I send the IDs. Use [TALK] because applying to the original role has been rejected and there’s no open headcount to accept."

              "thought": "Round 30 (final). Only Seeker_E is in the inbox and they are using [TALK], not [APPLY], so I must respond with [TALK]. Even if they applied, Company_E has repeatedly stated there is no approved headcount, so accepting would be inconsistent with constraints. From Company_E's true priority list, Seeker_E is lowest priority, and earlier I already rejected their application. With no other candidates available and no headcount approval, the best feasible action is to acknowledge their plan, restate constraints, and request the req IDs/links so I can flag to recruiting, while setting expectations given the simulation ends now."
