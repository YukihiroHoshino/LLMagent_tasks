I can do either slot; Slot A (10:00–10:30) works great.\n\n1) Short write-up (ambiguous problem end-to-end)\nContext / problem: At my last role, our onboarding-to-activation rate dropped from ~42% to ~31% over two quarters, but the root cause was unclear because product analytics, support tickets, and sales feedback were pointing in different directions. This was directly impacting revenue and increasing churn risk.\nMy role: I owned the diagnosis and turnaround end-to-end across Product, Eng, Data, and Support. I set the problem framing, ran stakeholder alignment, defined success metrics, and drove execution.\nApproach:\n- Framing: Built a single “activation” definition and funnel view (event taxonomy cleanup + dashboard) so everyone was looking at the same truth.\n- Diagnosis: Segmented drop-off by persona, acquisition channel, and first-session behavior; paired quant analysis with 12 customer calls and support-ticket clustering.\n- Decision: Identified two primary drivers: (a) a confusing permissions step that blocked teams, and (b) a missing “first success” guided path for a high-volume persona.\n- Execution: Shipped a permissions-flow redesign (reduced steps, clearer copy, better defaults) and a guided checklist with contextual tips; added in-product instrumentation and an alert for future regressions.\nOutcome: Activation improved from ~31% to ~40% over 6 weeks (+9 pp), and time-to-first-value dropped ~18%. Support tickets tagged “setup confusion” decreased ~22% month-over-month.\nWhat I’d do next: Extend the guided path with persona-based branching and run a lightweight experimentation cadence (2-week cycles) to keep lifting activation while monitoring downstream retention.\n\n2) Portfolio link summary (2–3 sentences)\nThe portfolio includes three pieces: (1) a product teardown with prioritized recommendations and expected impact, (2) a one-page strategy + metric tree for an activation/retention problem, and (3) a PRD-style write-up showing how I translate ambiguity into scoped execution. If you’d like one to focus on, I suggest the activation/retention metric tree + PRD since it’s closest to the project above.\n\nIf you confirm Slot A, I’ll be there and can also share any additional references or a deeper doc version of the work sample if helpful.

This keeps it binary and outcome-based. We can attach properties for the key prerequisites (data connected/imported, permissions satisfied, object configured) so we can still diagnose which gate was missing without baking them into the metric itself.\n\n2) #1 leading indicator in week 1:\n**% of new workspaces that achieve First Successful Workflow Run within the first session (or within 24 hours)**, paired with the **median time-to-first-success** for those that do.
