Per your request, here are **two brief examples** where I owned an ongoing operational KPI with weekly cadence, end-to-end instrumentation, and sustained adoption:\n\n1) **SLA / cycle-time KPI (weekly cadence)**\n- **Baseline → target:** On-time completion ~72% / median cycle time 5.8 days → target 90%+ / 4.0 days.\n- **Instrumentation I owned:** Defined event taxonomy + required status fields, partnered with Eng to add missing timestamps, and built the dashboard (Looker/Sheets) with weekly cohort views + reason codes.\n- **Weekly operating cadence:** Ran a weekly KPI review with Ops/Support leads (top drivers, aging queue, owner-level action items), and maintained a rolling backlog of fixes.\n- **Sustained result:** Reached **91–93% on-time** and **~4.1 days** median cycle time and held it for ~8–10 consecutive weeks; adoption sustained via SOP + weekly review + automated alerts.\n\n2) **Quality / rework rate KPI (weekly cadence)**\n- **Baseline → target:** Rework tickets ~18–20% of volume → target <10%.\n- **Instrumentation I owned:** Implemented QA sampling rubric, created a lightweight intake form to capture defect type/root cause, and built a weekly defect dashboard + Pareto.\n- **Weekly operating cadence:** Facilitated weekly calibration + coaching, tracked defect themes, and drove 1–2 process changes per week (templates, checks, gating).\n- **Sustained result:** Reduced rework to **~9–11%** and maintained for ~2 months; kept adoption through training, QA ownership assignment, and publishing weekly scorecards.\n\nIf this is the type of KPI ownership signal you were missing, is there a scenario where you’d reconsider the adjacent/fast-follow path within the next round? If helpful, I can also share a redacted screenshot/table of the weekly dashboard views (no sensitive data).",
