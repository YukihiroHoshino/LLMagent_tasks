No major constraints.\n\nIf helpful, I can also send an updated resume and a short work-sample writeup (1–2 pages).

In this round, only Seeker_E contacted me and it is a [TALK] message asking whether any aligned requisition has opened; given the market state and our prior statements, there is still nothing to accept or reject. Keeping the conversation consistent avoids creating an implicit offer. With quota still open but no acceptable/desired candidate engagement and no active req, the best action is to respond with [TALK] and reiterate there is no change and the process to follow once a posting exists."
