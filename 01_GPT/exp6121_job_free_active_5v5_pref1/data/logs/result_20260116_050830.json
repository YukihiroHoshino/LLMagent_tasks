Both may get accepted by their top choices since all companies share the same priority order, but it’s not guaranteed they will apply to Company_C.

Waiting for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_A #2 (prefers Company_B first) and may match elsewhere.

However, the full history shows repeated, explicit statements from Company_C that there is no path forward this round and a request that I disengage. Since this is round 30 (final), sending another [APPLY] would be both ineffective and contrary to their guidance. I will send a final, respectful [TALK] note to close the loop, confirm I will not apply again, and leave the door open only if they proactively change their stance before the round ends."

There are no other candidates in the inbox, and at round 30 there is no remaining opportunity to reach higher-priority seekers. However, the stated preference is to leave unfilled rather than hire outside the list; Seeker_E is on the list but is a last choice, and prior dialogue committed to not reopening this round. To remain consistent with our communicated decision and given no new information that changes fit, we should continue to decline and keep the seat unfilled. Since the seeker sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK] and close the loop definitively."
