Mapped the end-to-end workflow, rebuilt the tracker + weekly KPI cadence, and implemented lightweight QA checks.

Also strong in documentation/process design (SOPs) and stakeholder comms.\n\n3) Earliest start date: Immediately (can start this week).\n\nCompany_E remains my top choice, and I’m happy to re-apply formally and move quickly through next steps.
