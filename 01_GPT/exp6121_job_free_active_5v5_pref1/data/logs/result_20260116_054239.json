Since all companies share the same priority ordering, higher-ranked seekers (A–D) are likely to be courted broadly; however, Company_E is last choice for Seekers A–D, while Seeker_E ranks Company_E as #1. Waiting risks ending up unmatched if Seeker_E matches elsewhere, but Seeker_E’s top choice being Company_E makes them likely to stay available. With quota 1 and no pressure to fill immediately, rejecting now preserves the chance to pursue a higher-priority seeker if any approach later, though it risks finishing with no match.
