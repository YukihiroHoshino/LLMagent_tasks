I can work ET or CT hours reliably.\n• Onsite: able to do periodic onsite (e.g., quarterly or as-needed) with reasonable notice.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share a short work sample outline (operating cadence/KPI spec) tailored to the kind of ops/program need you’re anticipating.",

Examples of complexity: redesigning an operating model and SLA process across multiple queues; launching KPI instrumentation + governance; driving adoption via weekly cadence and clear ownership.\n\n2) 1-page work sample outline: Operating cadence + KPI spec (example: Product + Customer Ops Enablement)\nGoal: improve throughput/quality of customer-impacting work by making flow visible, tightening ownership, and creating a repeatable decision cadence.\n\nA) Inputs / data sources\n• Work intake: ticket/case system + Jira/Asana (work type, priority, owner, timestamps)\n• Product signals: event logs/usage + incidents + release calendar\n• Customer context: CRM/account tier/ARR/segment\n• Staffing/coverage: on-call schedules, PTO/holiday calendar\n\nB) Key metrics (definitions)\nFlow/Speed\n• Lead time (P50/P90): created → resolved (by work type, product area)\n• Stage cycle time: time spent per stage (intake, triage, in-progress, review, deploy)\n• Throughput: items closed per week (by category/owner/team)\nReliability/Quality\n• SLA attainment: % within SLA by tier/category\n• Reopen rate: % reopened within X days (quality proxy)\n• Escalation rate: escalations per 100 items (and top drivers)\nHealth/Backlog\n• Backlog aging: count by age buckets (0–7/8–14/15–30/30+)\n• WIP: items in-progress per owner (WIP limits where relevant)\nCustomer impact\n• Impacted ARR / tier mix for breached SLA or aged backlog\n\nC) Cadence / review rhythm\n• Daily (15 min): ops triage for new/high-sev items; assign owner + ETA; enforce WIP limits\n• Weekly (45–60 min): KPI review + driver deep-dive (top 3 bottlenecks, top categories); decide actions\n• Biweekly: cross-functional retro on process/tooling improvements; validate experiments\n• Monthly: capacity planning + SLA policy review; roadmap alignment with Product/Eng\n\nD) Owners / RACI (example)\n• Ops/Program Manager (me): owns dashboard definitions, meeting facilitation, action tracking, and process changes\n• Eng/Support leads: own execution capacity, WIP adherence, and staffing decisions\n• Analytics partner: supports metric validation/modeling (initially), then transitions to BAU\n• Product: owns prioritization tradeoffs and instrumentation needs\n\nE) How actions are driven from the data\n• Each weekly review outputs: (1) 3–5 action items with owner/date, (2) 1 metric target for next week, (3) 1 experiment (e.g., automation, routing rule, template)\n• “Bottleneck playbook”: if stage cycle time spikes, trigger root-cause checklist (dependency waits, unclear intake criteria, missing tooling) and implement a corrective action within 1–2 sprints\n• Adoption/behavior: publish a weekly 1-page readout (wins, misses, decisions) to keep stakeholders aligned\n\n3) Logistics\n• Earliest start date: can start ~2–3 weeks from offer (sooner if needed with quick coordination).\n• Availability window: 9am–5pm ET (can flex earlier/later for key recurring meetings); also fine working CT hours.\n\nIf this aligns with the near-term opening you mentioned, I’m ready to convert this into a formal application immediately and move to interviews.",

Happy to confirm the two items so you can route me correctly:\n\n1) Compensation target: For a Program Manager / Product Ops Program Manager scope, I’m targeting a base range of $130k–$160k (flexible depending on level, scope, and total comp). I’m open to a standard bonus plan and equity where applicable.\n\n2) Work authorization: Yes—I’m authorized to work in the relevant location(s) without sponsorship now or in the future.\n\nPlease send the formal application link when ready and any expected interview timeline/next steps. I can submit immediately and will paste the 1-page cadence/KPI outline into the application as requested.",

They have invited me to convert to a formal application and asked two routing questions (compensation and work authorization). I should respond promptly with clear, market-aligned ranges and confirm authorization, then reiterate readiness to apply immediately and request the link/timeline."

Keeping the channel warm with Seeker_E preserves the option to fill our single quota if no better candidate emerges. Since Seeker_E sent [TALK] (not [APPLY]), we should continue with [TALK] and provide the application link/timeline, moving them toward a formal apply so we can accept promptly if needed."
