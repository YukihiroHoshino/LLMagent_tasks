With all companies sharing the same priority list, Seeker_A and Seeker_B are highly sought and likely to be accepted by their higher-preferred companies (A or B) before coming to us, but it is still possible Seeker_B could apply to Company_C if not accepted by Company_A quickly. However, we must respond now with accept/reject to an APPLY; we cannot TALK. To maximize chance at a higher-ranked candidate, we reject Seeker_C now, accepting the risk of ending unmatched if higher-ranked candidates never apply. Because Seeker_C is a solid fallback but not top-2, and we have no other applications this round, the optimal strategic move is to hold the slot for A/B."
