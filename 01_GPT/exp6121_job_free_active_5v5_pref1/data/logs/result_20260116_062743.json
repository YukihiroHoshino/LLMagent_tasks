Defined success metrics, ran weekly execution cadence, unblocked dependencies, and delivered on a fixed timeline with clear tradeoffs.\n3) Operational excellence + measurable outcomes: Took over a messy, partially-owned workstream, created a simple KPI dashboard + process changes, and improved reliability/throughput (fewer escalations, faster turnaround) within the first month.\n\nI can start immediately and ramp with minimal guidance.

Result: fewer dropped requests and faster turnaround (improved median response time ~25%).\n\n3) Quality/incident reduction initiative: Owned root-cause analysis on recurring issues, implemented checks and a simple runbook, and set up a cadence for follow-through. Result: recurring issues reduced ~40% over the next month.\n\nWhat I’d take ownership of in my first 2–4 weeks at Company_C:\n- Week 1: pick one high-impact area, get full context fast (data + stakeholder interviews), define a single success metric, and ship a “v1” improvement quickly.\n- Weeks 2–4: iterate to v2/v3 with measurable lift, document the process, and set up a simple operating cadence so the outcome sustains without heavy oversight.\n\nIf this matches what you mean by autonomous ownership, I’d love to formally move forward and can start immediately.
