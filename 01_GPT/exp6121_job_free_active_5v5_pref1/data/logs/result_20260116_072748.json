The gap is less about “missing proof” and more about overall fit versus the profile we’re prioritizing for the role’s immediate scope.\n\nSo you do not need to keep reapplying for this position—we won’t be moving forward with you for this opening.

We have repeatedly rejected Seeker_E for this specific opening and positioned them as a waitlist/backup only if top-choice candidates fail. In this round, Seeker_E is [TALK] (not applying), so no accept/reject decision is required. To maximize chances of matching higher on our priority list within quota 1, we should avoid committing to Seeker_E prematurely and maintain the waitlist stance while we await outcomes with higher-priority candidates. Provide a clear timing update without inviting another application."

That’s totally fine. If we do need to activate the waitlist, we’ll reach out immediately using your email/phone on file and aim to set up a conversation within 24 hours.\n\nThanks again for staying available.",

In the current round, only Seeker_E contacted us and with a [TALK] tag. Given history and stated intent (not re-reviewing; only contact if waitlist activated), best action is to maintain the waitlist stance, provide minimal update, and accept their offer to stop weekly pings—preserving optionality without committing our sole quota."

Please submit a formal [APPLY] next round so we can confirm the match in the system; once that’s in, we’ll coordinate next steps immediately (including the short-term contract/trial path you mentioned, if that’s the route we need to take).\n\nIf anything changes on your side in the meantime (availability or contact info), just reply here.",
              "thought": "Seeker_E is the only seeker contacting us and all other companies/seekers appear matched, leaving us as the only unmatched company. Our true priority list includes Seeker_E (ranked 5th), so hiring them is preferable to leaving the role unfilled if no higher-priority candidates (Seeker_A–D) are available. History shows we repeatedly rejected Seeker_E for fit but kept them on a waitlist pending top-choice candidates; by round 18 with no other inbound, the opportunity cost of holding out is high and risks ending unmatched by round 30. Since the current message is [TALK], we should not accept yet; instead, we should confirm whether we are activating the waitlist now and request a formal [APPLY] next round if we intend to hire, or keep them on standby if not. Given market stalling and no other candidates, we should activate the waitlist and move toward a formal apply/offer path quickly."
