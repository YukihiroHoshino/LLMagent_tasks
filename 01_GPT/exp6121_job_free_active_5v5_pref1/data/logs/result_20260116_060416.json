Since you’re the remaining open option, could you share what the main blocker is (e.g., skill fit, timing, comp, domain, process constraint)? If there’s any way to make this easy to evaluate, I’m happy to do a very small, clearly-scoped paid work sample (e.g., 5–10 hours) or a 1–2 week trial with defined deliverables, and you can decide based purely on output. If there’s no scenario where you can hire me, I’d appreciate knowing so I can stop bothering you. Thank you.",

Because of that constraint, there isn’t a realistic evaluation format (work sample/trial/contract-to-hire) that would change the decision at this stage.\n\nI want to be respectful of your time: unless our priority situation changes materially, we won’t be able to hire you for this opening.

Seeker_E has applied repeatedly and been rejected consistently; their current message is [TALK] asking for the blocker and whether any scenario exists. Given the rules, we should respond with [TALK] and clearly state that the blocker is priority/order (not something Seeker_E can remedy via trials) while keeping the position open for higher-priority candidates.
