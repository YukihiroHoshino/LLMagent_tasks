Shipped in 6 weeks; improved the primary KPI by ~12% and reduced manual steps by ~25%.\n2) Experimentation/iteration: Built a lightweight test-and-learn cadence with clear success metrics; ran 10+ experiments over a quarter, leading to 2 launches that lifted conversion ~6–8%.\n3) Cross-functional delivery: Led alignment across Eng/Product/Ops on a multi-team dependency; introduced a milestone + risk-tracking process that improved on-time delivery from ~70% to ~90%.\n4) Analytics for prioritization: Created a dashboard and decision framework to focus roadmap on highest-impact segments; reallocated effort and drove ~15% efficiency gain in the team’s throughput.\n\nGiven these, which lane (Product/Platform Execution vs Growth/Experimentation vs Ops/Program-embedded) do you think is the best fit at Company_E—and what specific titles/keywords should I watch for when roles post?

In your resume/header, lead with **Activation + Lifecycle ownership** and **experiment rigor** (guardrails, significance, holdouts) so you get auto-triaged into the Growth/Lifecycle review queue.\n\n3) **What to apply to immediately**: Apply to the first posting that explicitly mentions **Activation (onboarding/first value)** or **Lifecycle/Retention** plus **experimentation/CRO**. If you paste the JD link when you see it, I’ll tell you exactly which 5–7 phrases to mirror and which of your bullets to reorder to match that team’s screen.\n\nIf you’re up for it, send your 1-page resume (or just the top section + 2–3 most relevant bullets) and tell me which you want to anchor on first: **Activation** or **Lifecycle/Retention**—I’ll help tighten it to the most common Company_E Growth screens.
