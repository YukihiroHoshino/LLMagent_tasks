I set the weekly operating cadence, maintained the backlog, drove cross-functional handoffs, and reported outcomes. Result: improved on-time delivery from ~70% to ~90% over two cycles and reduced rework by tightening requirements and acceptance criteria.\n\n2) Role-specific execution under ambiguity: I led a project where the “what” was clear but the “how” wasn’t—mapped the current process, defined success metrics, implemented automation + documentation, and trained stakeholders. Result: reduced turnaround time by ~30% and cut repeat issues by ~20% (tracked via tickets).\n\nScope/level: I’m targeting an IC role where I can own a defined domain end-to-end (mid-level), or a slightly narrower scope on a team with strong mentorship if the core function is the priority. I’m open to adjacent teams where my execution + analytics strengths apply directly to the same core work.\n\nIf a different team/level opens that’s closer to my background, I’d really appreciate being flagged.
