I’m comfortable operating as an “owner” for an operating cadence and can be the single-threaded driver for definitions, datasets, WBR/QBR, and follow-through.\n\n2) **Most relevant domain:** **Sales Ops / Revenue Ops + GTM analytics** (pipeline/funnel definitions, SLA/throughput, forecasting inputs, weekly business reviews with sales/CS/ops leaders). I’ve also partnered closely with Product/Eng to instrument metrics and operationalize them.\n\nI know you said there isn’t a new seat that changes the decision, but if your remaining slot is truly optimizing for (a) **exec-facing WBR/QBR ownership across multiple teams** and (b) **near-zero-ramp domain**, I can credibly cover that in RevOps/GTM contexts and can share a crisp 30/60/90 for standing up an exec-ready operating rhythm in your immediate problem space.\n\nIf there’s any chance to be reconsidered for the final slot, what is the exact near-term domain/problem area you’re prioritizing (e.g., activation, retention, marketplace liquidity, cost-to-serve)? If it’s a hard no, I’d appreciate the closest **title/job family** to watch for (e.g., BizOps Senior Analyst, Strategy & Ops, RevOps/Growth Ops, Analytics) so I can re-enter when it reopens with the right positioning.",
