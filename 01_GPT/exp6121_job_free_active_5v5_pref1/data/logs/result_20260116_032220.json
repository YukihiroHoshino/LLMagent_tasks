I’m flexible on exact title/level and can align to your highest-priority gap.\n\n2) Most relevant recent outcomes/metrics: I’ve led initiatives that improved core process efficiency and reliability (e.g., reducing cycle time/hand-offs and tightening execution cadence), and I’m strongest when I can turn ambiguous goals into a clear plan, ship quickly, and iterate based on feedback.\n\n3) Start date/constraints: I can start immediately (within ~1–2 weeks) and I’m flexible on schedule; no major constraints.\n\nIf this is close to what you’re hiring for, I’d welcome the 10-minute calibration chat and can come prepared with a crisp 30/60/90 plan aligned to your current priorities.

Here’s the specific calibration info you asked for:\n\n1) One project I owned end-to-end (goal / what I did / measurable impact):\n- Goal: Reduce customer onboarding cycle time and eliminate drop-offs caused by manual handoffs.\n- What I did: Mapped the end-to-end workflow, identified the top 3 bottlenecks, redesigned the intake + triage process, implemented a lightweight SLA/queue system, and added weekly operating metrics + a simple escalation path. I also coordinated across Sales/Ops/Support to standardize requirements and remove rework.\n- Before/after: Onboarding cycle time improved from ~12 days to ~7 days (~42% faster). Handoff-related rework tickets dropped ~30%. On-time onboarding (within SLA) increased from ~55% to ~85% over ~6 weeks.\n\n2) Strongest depth + tools/systems used hands-on:\n- Depth: Ops/process + analytics (turning ambiguous goals into measurable operating cadence).\n- Tools: Excel/Google Sheets, SQL (intermediate—pulling/cleaning KPI tables), dashboards in Looker/Data Studio, Jira/Asana for execution tracking, and basic automation via Zapier/Apps Script where helpful.\n\n3) Closest domain/context to your needs:\n- I’m strongest in fast-moving, resource-constrained environments where the immediate need is to tighten execution, improve reliability, and make outcomes measurable. Even if the domain differs, the pattern is the same: clarify the “exact problem area,” instrument it, and drive a measurable before/after quickly.\n\nIf this is close to the immediate opening, I’d love to do the 10-minute calibration chat and can come prepared with a crisp plan tailored to the specific problem area you’re hiring for.

I personally mapped the failure points, drafted the checklist, facilitated alignment, and implemented the gating step.\n- Lever 3 (visibility + escalation): Set up a simple dashboard and weekly review (cycle time by stage, aging, SLA hit rate, top delay reasons) plus an escalation path for stalled items. I personally pulled the data (SQL/Sheets), built the dashboard, and set the operating cadence; I delegated a portion of ongoing reporting upkeep after it stabilized.\n\n2) First 2 weeks at Company_E: diagnose + instrument an ops/process problem area\n- Days 1–2: Confirm the “problem statement” and success metrics with the hiring manager (what outcome matters, target level, constraints). Identify the process boundaries (start/end) and stakeholders.\n- Days 2–4: Pull baseline data + map workflow.\n  • Data: volume, throughput, cycle time (p50/p75/p90), backlog/aging, SLA hit rate, rework/defects, top delay reasons, handoff counts.\n  • Sources: CRM/ticketing/project tracker + any warehouse tables; if messy, start with a manual sample + lightweight logging.\n- Days 4–7: Build a v1 dashboard + taxonomy.\n  • KPIs: cycle time by stage, WIP/backlog aging, SLA %, rework %, stage conversion/drop-off, top blockers.\n  • Outputs: a single “weekly operating” dashboard + a daily/biweekly view for the team.\n- Week 2: Implement operating cadence + quick wins.\n  • Cadence: daily 15-min triage (prioritize/unstick), weekly 30–45 min metrics review (what moved, why, next experiments), and a clear escalation path.\n  • Quick wins: remove 1–2 obvious bottlenecks (e.g., definition-of-ready checklist, ownership assignment, WIP limits, automation of a repetitive step) and measure before/after weekly.\n\nIf this looks aligned, I’m ready to schedule the 10-minute calibration chat immediately—happy to work around your availability.",
