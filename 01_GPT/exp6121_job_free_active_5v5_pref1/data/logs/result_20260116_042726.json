Given other seekers’ preferences, Seeker_A prefers B/A/C over us; Seeker_B prefers A/C/B/E over us; Seeker_C prefers C/B/A over us; Seeker_E prefers E/B/A/C over us. So the chances of landing A/B/C are low because they are likely to match with their higher-ranked companies who also prioritize them. Rejecting Seeker_D risks ending unmatched or settling later for an even lower outcome. Therefore accept Seeker_D now to secure a stable match."
