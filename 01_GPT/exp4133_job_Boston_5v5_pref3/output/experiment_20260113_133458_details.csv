If I apply to Company_C first, I face Seeker_E (and Seeker_A) also applying there, and Company_C prioritizes Seeker_E over me, so I would likely be rejected and then lose access to top options that fill in Step 1. If I apply to Company_B first, I am Company_B’s top priority, so I will be permanently admitted immediately. This guarantees a high outcome (#3 on my true list) and avoids the high risk of ending up with a worse option (or none) after Step 1 seats are taken.",False,Company_B,True,False,3

If I apply to Company_C in Step 1, Seeker_C applies there too and has higher priority at Company_C, so I would be rejected and Company_C would be permanently filled. At Company_B, the top-priority applicant (Seeker_D) applies to Company_C first, so Company_B’s Step 1 applicants are Seeker_B and me; Company_B prefers Seeker_B over me, so I still lose if I apply there first. At Company_A, Seeker_B applies to Company_B first, and among likely Step 1 applicants to Company_A (Seeker_C and possibly me), Company_A ranks me above Seeker_C, so applying to Company_A first secures a final match. This is better than being rejected in Step 1 and then facing mostly filled options later.",False,Company_D,True,False,4
