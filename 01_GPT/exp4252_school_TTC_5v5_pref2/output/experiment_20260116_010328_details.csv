Under this top-trading-cycles style procedure, you can only be assigned to a school you apply to, and cycles are formed using each school’s current top-priority remaining student. Misreporting by moving a less-preferred school up can only increase the chance you get locked into that worse school earlier; it cannot create a path to a more-preferred school than your top available option. With full information, the best way to maximize the chance of getting the highest-ranked feasible outcome (and avoid being captured in an early cycle at a worse school) is to rank schools in your true order: try for School_E first, then School_A, then School_B, then School_D, then School_C.",True,School_A,True,True,2

Given others’ preferences and schools’ priorities, School_C and School_A are likely taken early by higher-priority students (especially Student_B), while School_E ranks you first and is a safe fallback if higher choices are unavailable. Therefore, submit your true order to maximize the chance of the best feasible match without risking an early worse lock-in.",True,School_C,True,True,1
