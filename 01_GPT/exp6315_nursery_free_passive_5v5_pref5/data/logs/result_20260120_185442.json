Where applicable, we also consider practical constraints like proximity/commute and any continuity considerations (e.g., existing connections to the community).\n\nTo strengthen your candidacy, it helps to share: your preferred start date, the exact weekly schedule you need, any relevant developmental/support needs we should plan for, and what you value most in early-years education. If you have a short note about your child’s interests and how you see them thriving in a play-based setting, that’s also very helpful.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your ideal schedule and start date, and any key needs/preferences—then I can confirm whether we’re a strong fit and what the next steps would be from our side.",
