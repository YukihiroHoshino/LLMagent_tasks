We’d be happy to share more.\n\nOur daily routine is structured but flexible: a warm drop-off and free-choice centers, a morning circle (songs, stories, planning the day), small-group activities (early literacy, math/play-based inquiry), lots of outdoor/gross-motor time, and a calm closing circle for reflection and transitions. Throughout the day we build in predictable cues (visual schedules, consistent routines) to help children feel secure and confident.\n\nFor social-emotional development, we focus on: (1) emotion labeling and regulation (breathing tools, calm-down corner, co-regulation with adults), (2) friendship skills (turn-taking, joining play, repairing after conflict), and (3) problem-solving language (e.g., “I don’t like that,” “Can I have a turn next?”). Teachers model and coach in-the-moment, and we use positive guidance rather than punitive approaches.\n\nOn priorities/factors this cycle: we look for a strong family-school partnership and alignment with our approach (consistent routines, collaborative communication), as well as readiness for group care (ability to separate with support, participate in routines, and engage safely with peers). We also consider fit with the classroom community and any relevant needs we can support well.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, where does Nursery_D sit among your top choices right now, and what are you hoping your child gains most this year (social confidence, language growth, independence, etc.)? That will help me respond more specifically.",

We keep structure predictable but flexible, following children’s interests while supporting key early skills (social development, communication, early numeracy/literacy through play).\n\nSettling-in: we use a gradual transition tailored to each child. Typically this starts with a parent/carer staying briefly, then short separations, building up as the child shows comfort. We assign a key person to support attachment, keep routines consistent, and communicate closely with families (what’s working, triggers, comfort items, sleep/food patterns).\n\nFit factors we prioritize are mostly about whether we can meet the child’s needs well: schedule/attendance pattern, any sleep or dietary needs, separation anxiety/temperament considerations, language needs, and any additional support needs. It also helps to know what routines at home are important to you and what a “good day” looks like for your child.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: your child’s age, start date flexibility, preferred schedule (days/hours), and anything that particularly helps them settle (comfort object, nap routine, transitions).
