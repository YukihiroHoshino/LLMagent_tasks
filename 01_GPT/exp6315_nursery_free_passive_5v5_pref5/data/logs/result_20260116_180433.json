Although I prefer Nursery_C or Nursery_D, I do not know if/when I will be paired with them, and competition exists (e.g., Parent_B is top priority at Nursery_C; Parent_D is top at Nursery_D). Given the round-based random pairing and single-message constraint, locking in Nursery_A now is a safe high-quality outcome."

Waiting to chase Nursery_A (where I’m ranked 4th) risks losing Nursery_B to another applicant. With no prior commitments and capacity 1, applying now maximizes my chance of a high-ranked match."

However, Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me 3rd (after Parent_D and Parent_A). Parent_D and Parent_A both rank Nursery_D last, so they are unlikely to apply early; this improves my acceptance chances. Applying now could secure a solid match while others chase B/C/A.

              "thought": "Parent_C is on our true priority list (3rd). With quota 1 and no existing match, accepting secures a reasonably high-priority parent. Waiting for Parent_D or Parent_A is risky because they rank Nursery_D last and are unlikely to apply. Parent_E may apply (ranks us 2nd) but is 4th on our list; Parent_B is last on our list.

Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A, so they may not apply to C early; Parent_C’s top choice is Nursery_B, so they may also not apply to C first.

With quota 1, we should consider holding out for Parent_B or Parent_C, who rank us 3rd and 2nd respectively, but they both prefer Nursery_B and may be taken by Nursery_B/Nursery_A.

Also, Nursery_E’s priority ranks me 1st, so if I apply now I likely secure a match, but that would forgo attempts at B/C/A where my priority is low (B: last; C: last; A: middle).

Teachers observe and document children’s interests and progress, then plan activities that build language, social-emotional skills, and early math/reading readiness through hands-on materials and conversation.\n\nHours/flexibility: We can discuss options depending on your needs (e.g., standard day and possible earlier drop-off/later pick-up where available). If you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up times and your preferred start date, I can tell you what would fit best.\n\nIf Nursery_E is a strong contender for you, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready—happy to answer any specific questions you have about your child’s needs as well (sleep/rest habits, allergies, temperament, etc.).",
