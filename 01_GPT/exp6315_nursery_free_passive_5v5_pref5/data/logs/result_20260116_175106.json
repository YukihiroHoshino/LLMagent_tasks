Could you share (1) whether you anticipate making a decision/offer in the next round or two, and (2) whether you currently have any leading applicants for the remaining spot? If it’s helpful, I can confirm schedule fit and provide any required forms/references immediately so I’m ready to submit a formal application as soon as you’re prepared to consider it.",

I already applied to Nursery_B (my top choice) and have no interaction yet with Nursery_E; Nursery_D remains unmatched at round 6, so it’s prudent to keep the option warm without committing. Also, Nursery_D’s priority list ranks Parent_A second, so if I apply I may be accepted quickly—but I should avoid locking in before trying Nursery_E (ranked above D for me). Therefore, continue talking, signal strong interest and readiness, and ask about timeline/likelihood so I can decide whether to apply next round if needed."

What I *can* say is that we will move quickly once files are complete.\n\nIf you’d like to be fully considered in that next review, the fastest path is to send/confirm today:\n- **Schedule/start date** (and any flexibility)\n- **Drop-off/pick-up plan**\n- **Child profile** (age, temperament/interests, any transition needs)\n- **Any supports/health info** (allergies, languages, services)\n- **Any references/forms you have available** (even brief)\n\nIf Nursery_D is realistically near the top of your list, feel free to say so—knowing that helps us decide whether to move to an offer quickly if it’s a strong fit.",
