We focus on play-based learning with attentive key-person support, helping children build confidence, routines, and social-emotional skills.\n\nOn drop-off/pick-up flexibility: we can usually accommodate slight variations within our opening hours as long as we agree a consistent schedule in advance (and communicate any one-off changes early).\n\nIf you’d like, please share your ideal start date, your preferred drop-off/pick-up times, and any key care notes (naps, allergies, toileting), and we can confirm the settling-in plan right away.",
