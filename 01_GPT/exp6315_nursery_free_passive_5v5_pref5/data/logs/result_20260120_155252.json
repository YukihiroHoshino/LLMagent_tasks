We communicate with families proactively so home/school routines stay aligned.\n\nCore hours & flexibility: our core day runs during standard school-day hours, and we typically can offer a reasonable drop-off/pick-up window around those times depending on staffing and your needs.

That includes:\n- Clear routines and simple, consistent classroom expectations\n- Coaching language for emotions (“I see you’re frustrated—let’s take a breath and try again”)\n- Helping children problem-solve conflicts (turn-taking, asking for space, using words)\n- Redirection and choices, with logical consequences when needed\n- Close communication with families if a pattern shows up, so we can stay consistent across school and home\n\n3) Drop-off/pick-up flexibility:\nWe can usually accommodate a reasonable arrival window and an extended pickup window depending on your schedule needs and staffing ratios that day. If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up times (and which days), I can confirm what we can support.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can be precise: (a) your child’s age, and (b) the days/hours you’re targeting.

Happy to share.\n\n1) Teacher-to-child ratio & staff continuity:\n- We keep ratios aligned with age-group guidelines and staffing requirements, and we aim to staff each classroom with a consistent lead teacher plus a consistent supporting teacher/assistant so children see the same familiar adults day to day.\n- Continuity across the year is a priority for us (we plan schedules to minimize mid-year changes). When changes are unavoidable (e.g., illness/leave), we use a small, consistent pool of known substitutes so children aren’t constantly meeting new faces.\n\n2) How we handle transitions (drop-off & between activities):\n- Drop-off: we use a predictable arrival routine (greeting at the door, a simple “goodbye ritual,” then a clear first activity such as a favorite center/table invitation). Teachers actively coach separation and help children settle with a calm, consistent handoff.\n- Between activities: we give children warnings (“5 minutes until clean-up”), use songs/visual cues, and keep transitions short and structured (clear jobs, clear next step). For children who find transitions harder, we use individualized supports (first/then language, a helper role, or a teacher walking with them) to reduce stress.\n\n3) Open-house/visit opportunities:\nYes— we can typically arrange a brief tour/visit window. If you share a couple of times/days that work for you next week, I’ll propose specific slots.\n\nOne quick question so I can guide you well: if you had to rank us today, are we in your top 1–2 choices, and would you be looking to apply soon if a spot is available?",
