We also communicate closely with families about comfort items, sleep needs, separation anxiety, and any strategies that work at home.\n\nTo help me share the most relevant details: **what is your child’s age/temperament**, and are there any specific needs (sleep schedule, allergies, language environment, or separation worries) you’d like us to plan for?\n\n[TALK]",

We use positive, respectful guidance—naming feelings, offering choices, and coaching problem-solving rather than punitive discipline.\n\nTo understand fit, could you share a bit about your child’s age/temperament and what you’re hoping for most in a nursery (e.g., outdoors time, structure vs flexibility, language environment)?
