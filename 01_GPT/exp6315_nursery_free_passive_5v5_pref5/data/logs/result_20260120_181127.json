With quota 1 and higher-priority parents (Parent_E, Parent_D) still unmatched, accepting Parent_A now could block a better match.

              "message": "Hello Parent_D—thank you for reaching out. I’m happy to share more.\n\n1) Daily routine & outdoor/play-based learning:\n- We run a predictable rhythm: arrival/free play and settling-in, morning circle (songs, stories, simple routines), extended child-led play with teacher-guided invitations (sensory, blocks, art, early literacy/numeracy through play), lunch, rest/quiet time, then afternoon play and pick-up.\n- Outdoors is a core part of the day whenever weather allows. We focus on active gross-motor play, nature exploration, and open-ended materials (sand/water, loose parts). Staff scaffold play with language, turn-taking, and problem-solving rather than directing every activity.\n\n2) Transitions & social-emotional support:\n- We use consistent visual/verbal cues (songs/timers) and small-group transitions where possible.\n- For new children, we build attachment and predictability first: a key-person approach, gradual separation plans when needed, and frequent check-ins with families.\n- We explicitly teach social skills in-the-moment—naming feelings, coaching simple scripts (“Can I have a turn?”), and supporting repair after conflict.\n\n3) Allocation factors when demand exceeds spots:\n- With one seat, we prioritize overall fit and readiness for our routine, the consistency of the schedule needed (and whether it matches our staffing/day structure), and strong family-school partnership/communication.\n- We also consider how quickly a family can confirm once we’re ready to make an offer, since we have to finalize promptly.\n\nVisits/open-house:\n- We can usually do a short visit/meet-and-greet (20–30 minutes) on weekday mornings. If you share a couple of windows that work for you, I’ll suggest specific times.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you accurately:\n- What start date are you aiming for, and what days/hours of care do you need?\n- Anything in particular your child benefits from during transitions (comfort items, routines, separation approach)?\n\nIf Nursery_E is a serious option for your family, I can also explain our application steps and typical decision timing once you confirm your schedule needs.",

Parent_D currently prefers Nursery_B/C/A/E/D, so Nursery_E is their 4th choice; they may not apply unless encouraged, but we should not over-promise given single seat and higher-priority candidates likely. Use TALK to answer questions, invite a visit, and ask for start date/schedule and what they value to assess fit and keep optionality."
