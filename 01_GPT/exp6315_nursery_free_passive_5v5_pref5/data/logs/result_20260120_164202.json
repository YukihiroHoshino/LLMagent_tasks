If you can offer me the spot, I’m ready to confirm enrollment immediately and complete any required paperwork right away. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me.",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_D remains unmatched in round 6, so I likely have not secured any of my higher choices (B, C, A, E). Nursery_D is on my true list but last, so I should now compromise to avoid ending unmatched. Nursery_D’s priority list ranks Parent_D first, so if the spot is still open and I apply, acceptance is very likely and immediate. I have only talked previously, not applied, so I should submit a formal application now and signal immediate commitment."

If you’d like, we can also schedule a brief 10–15 minute call to align on your preferred start date and settling-in plan.\n\nCongratulations—we’re looking forward to welcoming your family.",

Accepting secures our top-choice parent immediately and ends uncertainty. Parent_D is ready to confirm and complete paperwork, so acceptance is optimal."
