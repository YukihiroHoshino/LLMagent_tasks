I’m glad to share more about Nursery_D.\n\n(1) Educational approach & daily routine\nWe follow a play-based, child-centered approach with a calm, predictable rhythm. The day typically includes: warm arrival/settling-in play; a short group circle (songs/stories); extended child-led play with teacher-guided small-group activities (language, early literacy play, sensory/messy play, and process-focused art); outdoor time most days; lunch/rest; and a quieter afternoon with play, books, and small groups. We keep routines consistent so children feel secure, while adapting activities to their interests and developmental stage.\n\n(2) Social-emotional development & transitions\nWe focus on secure relationships and coaching children through feelings and peer conflicts (naming emotions, simple problem-solving, turn-taking support). For new starters, we use a gradual settling-in plan over several days: short visits with a parent/caregiver first, then gradually extending time as the child shows readiness. We assign a key educator to be the main attachment figure early on and keep communication very open so home and nursery can align on comfort strategies.\n\n(3) Visit or call\nYes—happy to arrange either. We can typically do a short phone/video call (15–20 min) or a brief visit outside the busiest parts of the day. If you share a couple of windows that work for you (e.g., two options on weekdays), I’ll propose specific times.\n\nTo help me advise you best: how old is your child, and what are your top priorities (outdoor time, structure vs flexibility, naps, language/arts)?

I’m happy to share details so you can gauge fit.\n\n1) Daily routine & teaching approach (play-based vs structured)\nWe’re primarily play-based with intentional adult guidance. That means children spend most learning time in rich play (role-play, construction, sensory, early mark-making), while educators scaffold language, early literacy, turn-taking, and problem-solving. We also include short, predictable group moments (story, songs, circle time) to build routine and listening skills—so it’s not “free play only,” but it isn’t a formal/worksheet style either.\n\n2) Outdoor time + lunch/nap\n• Outdoor: we go outside daily (weather permitting) for gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n• Lunch: calm, consistent routine with a focus on independence (self-feeding where appropriate) and positive social habits.\n• Rest/nap: we offer a quiet rest period after lunch; children who nap can do so, and non-nappers have calm activities (books, puzzles) so everyone’s needs are met.\n\n3) Hours & drop-off/pick-up flexibility\nWe operate on a set day schedule with defined drop-off/pick-up windows. If you tell me the hours you need (and whether you need early/late edges), I can confirm what’s possible for this intake and what flexibility we can offer.\n\n4) Settling-in process\nWe use a gradual, child-led settling-in plan:\n• Initial short visit with you present\n• Short separations building up over several days\n• A key-person approach so your child has a consistent primary educator\n• Regular check-ins (end of day plus a brief review after the first 1–2 weeks)\nWe adapt pace based on your child’s temperament and any prior childcare experience.\n\nOpen spot for this intake\nYes—at this moment we still have one place available for this intake.\n\nIf you’d like, share your child’s age, any allergies/additional needs, and the hours you’re aiming for, and I’ll confirm whether we can accommodate your schedule.
