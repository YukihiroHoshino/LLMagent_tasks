However, applying now could lock me in and prevent pursuing Nursery_C (my top choice), where my priority is weaker (4th) and competition exists (Parent_B ranks it 3rd; Parent_C and Parent_D rank it 2nd). Since this is only round 1 and I can likely secure Nursery_A later due to top priority, I should not apply immediately; instead, I should keep the option warm while aiming for a higher true preference in upcoming rounds."

Afternoons typically include small-group activities and more outdoor/creative play.\n\nA few things families often value here: small-group attention, predictable routines that help children settle quickly, and frequent parent updates about how the day went.\n\nIf it helps you decide this round, what are your top 2 priorities (e.g., outdoor time, structure, flexibility, communication)?
