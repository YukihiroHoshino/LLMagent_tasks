It is round 30 (final) and Parent_A is the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an acceptable candidate on our list. Parent_A has repeatedly expressed readiness to finalize immediately. Since Parent_A sent [TALK] (not [APPLY]), we cannot formally accept yet; we should clearly offer the place and instruct them to send [APPLY] immediately with required details, reiterating deposit and deadline as now/immediate due to final round."
