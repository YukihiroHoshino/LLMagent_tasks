Staff model calm co-regulation and help children practice independence in small, manageable steps.\n\nFor the **first-weeks transition**, we typically use a gradual settling-in plan: short initial visits, then progressively longer separations based on your child’s comfort. We keep drop-off consistent and communicate closely with you during the first couple of weeks so we can adjust pacing if needed.\n\nRegarding **hours/aftercare and family expectations**: we offer a structured core day with optional extended care depending on availability, and we ask families to support reliable drop-off/pick-up, keep us informed about changes at home that may affect a child’s day, and partner with us on consistent routines.\n\nThat said, we’re not able to move forward with an acceptance for this spot at this time. If your plans change or another opening arises, we’d be happy to reconnect.\n",

We can only make a formal offer once we have a confirmed opening and have reviewed current applicants under our priority order. Practically, that means offers can move **quickly when a spot opens**, but the exact timing depends on withdrawals/confirmations in the market.\n\nIf Nursery_E is a serious option for you, submitting an application **this round** ensures you’re considered as soon as we’re able to make an offer.
