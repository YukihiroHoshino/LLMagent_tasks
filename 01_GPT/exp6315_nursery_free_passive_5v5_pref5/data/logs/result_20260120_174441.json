Could you share (1) how you support children’s social-emotional development and transitions during the day, and (2) what you look for most when deciding among applicants? Also, if a family is a good fit, what are the next steps/timeline on your side? I appreciate any detail you can share.",

I should try for Nursery_B first if possible, but I’m currently paired with Nursery_E. Applying to E now could lock me into a worse outcome than potentially getting B. Also, Nursery_E’s priority list ranks me last, so an application is unlikely to be accepted if others apply. Best move is to keep E warm via TALK, signal interest without committing, and preserve flexibility to pursue B next."

This reduces anxiety and helps children anticipate what’s next.\n- **Emotion coaching:** Staff label feelings (“You look frustrated”) and teach concrete strategies (breathing, asking for help, taking space, using words). We reinforce repair skills—apologizing, trying again, and problem-solving with peers.\n- **Small-group work:** We intentionally use small groups to practice turn-taking, sharing materials, and cooperative play with close adult support.\n- **Transition supports:** We use songs/timers, “transition jobs” (line leader/helper), and individualized support for children who need extra time. If a child struggles, we focus on calm co-regulation first, then re-entry.\n- **Family partnership:** We align language and strategies with home when possible, and we flag patterns early (e.g., tough drop-offs, separation anxiety) so we can make a joint plan.\n\n**(2) What we look for most among applicants**\nWe prioritize families who:\n- **Align with our play-based, social-emotional focus** (and are comfortable with learning through play and routines)\n- **Communicate openly and collaboratively** (especially around transitions, sleep, allergies, or any support needs)\n- **Have schedules/start timing we can reliably support**\n\n**Next steps / timeline**\nIf you feel we’re a strong fit, the next step is a **formal application**. After receiving it, we typically:\n1) do a quick follow-up call to confirm schedule/start date and your child’s needs, and\n2) share a decision as soon as we can (often within a few rounds of the process), and if accepted, we move to enrollment paperwork and a settling-in plan.\n\nTo be sure we’re assessing fit accurately: how old is your child, and how do they typically handle transitions (drop-off, switching activities, waiting/turn-taking)? Also, what start date and weekly schedule are you aiming for?\n\n[TALK]",
