We’d be glad to share our placement priorities and the steps so you can decide whether to apply.\n\nTop placement priorities (what helps us confirm fit quickly):\n- Schedule fit (days/hours needed vs. our available slot) and consistency week to week.\n- Start-date alignment (we can be flexible within a reasonable window, but matching the opening matters).\n- Family partnership/communication style and comfort with our routines.\n- Practical logistics (drop-off/pick-up reliability). We don’t have sibling priority built into this market.\n\nSteps / timing:\n- If you decide to move forward, please send an [APPLY] message indicating your preferred schedule (days + drop-off/pick-up times) and ideal start date.\n- Once we confirm the schedule/start date fit, we can make a decision promptly.\n\nTo help you (and us) assess fit: what start date are you aiming for, and what weekly schedule/hours do you need? Any allergies, nap needs, or other supports we should plan for?",

Remaining unmatched parents are A, D, E; A is our top choice and has already engaged with us, so we should keep flexibility for Parent_A while still keeping Parent_E warm and informed to potentially apply if A doesn't. Parent_E currently only TALKs; we should respond with TALK, share priorities/steps, and ask for schedule/start details, without committing acceptance."
