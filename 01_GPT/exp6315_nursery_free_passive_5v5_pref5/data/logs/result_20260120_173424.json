Could you share (1) whether you’re currently holding or expecting applications from other families this round, and (2) what factors you weigh most when deciding whom to accept (e.g., schedule fit, sibling priority, alignment with your approach)? If a place is likely to remain available, I may be ready to submit an application very soon.",
              "thought": "Nursery_E is my last choice, but it is still acceptable. Remaining unmatched would be worse than taking E only if I cannot secure A/B/C/D. In round 3, unmatched nurseries are A, D, E, meaning B and C are likely already taken. I have decent priority at Nursery_E (3rd), but Nursery_E’s top choice is Parent_A, who also ranks E 4th and may apply if shut out of B/C/A. I have not applied anywhere yet; to keep flexibility and avoid locking into my last choice too early, I should continue talking and probe whether they are considering other applicants and how they view my fit, while signaling credible interest as a fallback."

I can’t share details about other families specifically, but with only **one spot**, we do move quickly when there’s a strong fit.\n\n2) **What we weigh most when deciding:**\n- **Alignment with our approach** (play-based, calm/consistent routines, collaborative communication with teachers)\n- **Schedule/attendance fit** (reliable attendance and routines that support the child’s settling-in)\n- **Child’s needs and how well we can support them** (temperament, any allergies/support needs, separation/transition needs)\n- **Family partnership** (responsiveness, consistency between home/school expectations)\n\nWe don’t have a formal sibling priority affecting this particular place.\n\nIf Nursery_E is genuinely near the top of your options, the best way to keep a realistic path here is to **apply as soon as you’re ready**—then we can evaluate promptly. If you share your child’s age, typical day schedule (drop-off/pick-up needs), and any support needs, I can also give you a very direct read on fit before you apply.",

We should keep B engaged and encourage applying soon, while not committing to holding the spot. Provide transparency: we can’t disclose specific other families, but can say we’re in active conversations and may receive applications. Emphasize key acceptance factors: alignment, schedule/attendance, communication, child needs, readiness; no sibling priority mentioned in data, so state none unless applicable. Goal: induce Parent_B to apply now while we still can, but maintain flexibility in case Parent_A applies."
