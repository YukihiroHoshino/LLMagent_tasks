Community/sibling ties can be a plus when they help continuity, but we mainly focus on fit and feasibility.\n\nOn timing: we don’t usually commit after a single chat—we aim to speak with several families, but we do move quickly once we feel confident about fit and logistics. If you’re interested, I’d encourage you to apply soon so we can keep you in active consideration.\n\nA couple quick questions: what start date and weekly schedule are you hoping for, and anything important you’d like us to know about your child’s temperament or support needs?",

Nursery_E has me ranked #1 in its priority list, so an application here is very likely to be accepted and would secure a match rather than risking ending unmatched.
