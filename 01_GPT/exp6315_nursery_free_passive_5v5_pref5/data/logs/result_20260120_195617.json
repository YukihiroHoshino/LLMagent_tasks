Teachers coach children in naming feelings, turn-taking, problem-solving, and repairing after conflict. We use consistent routines, positive guidance, and lots of modeling—helping children build independence while feeling safe and supported.\n\n**Hours/flexibility:** We aim to be as accommodating as possible within staffing ratios. We typically offer standard full-day hours with structured drop-off/pick-up windows; limited early/late options may be available depending on demand. If you share your ideal schedule, I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\n**What we value / who thrives here:** Families who communicate openly, partner with us on routines (sleep/toileting transitions, gentle boundaries), and value play, patience, and consistency. Children tend to thrive when they enjoy hands-on exploration, benefit from steady routines, and are ready to practice social skills in a group setting.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise on fit and availability: What’s your child’s age and start date, and what hours do you need? If things align, you’re welcome to submit an application as soon as you’re ready—spaces can move quickly.\n\n[TALK]",

We focus on language development, early problem-solving, and social-emotional skills (turn-taking, naming feelings, conflict repair) through routines, modeling, and guided play rather than worksheets.\n\n**Key policies (high level):**\n- Consistent routines and positive guidance/behavior support\n- Clear health/sick-day expectations to protect the group\n- Communication partnership with families (regular updates; quick alignment on transitions like toileting/sleep)\n- Drop-off/pick-up windows to maintain staffing ratios (we can discuss any schedule needs you have)\n\n**What we prioritize in applicants:**\n1) **Fit with our routine and approach** (play-based, collaborative family-school partnership)\n2) **Start date and schedule compatibility** with available staffing/ratio slots\n3) **Readiness for group care** (age-appropriate independence, comfort with transitions—totally normal to need support, we just want alignment)\n\n**Timeline for offers:** We review applications on a rolling basis and tend to make offers as soon as we can confirm fit and scheduling—often within a short window after receiving the application and having a brief follow-up.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be precise about availability and next steps: What’s your child’s age, ideal start date, and the hours/days you need?
