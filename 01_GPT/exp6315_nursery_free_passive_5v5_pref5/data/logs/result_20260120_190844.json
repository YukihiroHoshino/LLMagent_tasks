I’m happy to share more about Nursery_D.\n\n**Daily routine (typical day):**\n- **Arrival & free play:** calm drop-off, choice-based activities (blocks, art, books, sensory).\n- **Morning circle:** songs, stories, social-emotional check-in, simple routines.\n- **Outdoor time:** we aim for outdoor play daily (weather permitting), usually a longer morning block and/or a shorter afternoon one.\n- **Meals/snacks:** morning snack and lunch; we support a relaxed, supportive mealtime routine and can accommodate common dietary needs with advance notice.\n- **Nap/rest:** a consistent midday rest period; we support children who don’t sleep with quiet activities.\n- **Afternoon:** small-group activities (language, early numeracy through play), creative work, and another movement/outdoor window when possible.\n\n**Settling-in (transition for new children):**\nWe use a gradual, child-led approach. Typically:\n- Short initial visits with a caregiver, then brief separations.\n- We build a consistent “goodbye routine” and a predictable daily rhythm.\n- Key-person style support: one staff member focuses on helping your child feel safe and connected.\nWe adjust pace based on the child’s comfort and family schedule.\n\n**What we look for in families (admissions):**\n- Alignment on routines and communication (we value clear, respectful partnership).\n- Readiness to support consistent attendance and a predictable drop-off/pick-up plan.\n- Openness to our guidance during the settling-in period.\n- Any information that helps us support your child well (temperament, sleep/rest habits, allergies, languages spoken at home, etc.).\n\n**Timing / applying:**\nIt’s absolutely okay to follow up with an application after this conversation. That said, because we have **very limited capacity**, we do encourage families who feel we may be a strong fit to apply sooner rather than later so we can consider them in time.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share:\n1) your preferred start window, 2) needed days/hours, and 3) anything we should know about your child’s routines or support needs?\n\nIf Nursery_D is moving into your top set after this chat, you’re welcome to apply next round and we’ll respond promptly.",

Parent_A’s preference list ranks Nursery_D last, so they may not apply unless convinced; we should actively appeal and provide clear info, while encouraging an application soon. We previously rejected Parent_E (#4) and should keep flexibility for Parent_D (#1) if they appear, but securing Parent_A is still strong. Since Parent_A is in TALK mode, respond with details and nudge toward applying quickly, offering a short follow-up timeline and asking fit questions."
