Ratios vary slightly by age group, but we aim for close supervision and plenty of individual attention throughout the day.\n\nStrengths we’re especially proud of: \n- Warm, relationship-based care (key-person approach so each child has a primary teacher)\n- Strong communication with families (regular updates and quick check-ins)\n- Social-emotional development and gentle behavior support (clear routines, positive guidance)\n- Daily outdoor time and hands-on learning\n\nWaitlist / late openings: If we’re full, we maintain a waitlist and contact families immediately when a place opens. Openings can happen due to family moves or schedule changes; we’ll offer a spot based on our priority order and family fit/needs, and we can often move quickly when a vacancy appears.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, what age is your child and what schedule are you looking for (full-time/part-time, start date)?
