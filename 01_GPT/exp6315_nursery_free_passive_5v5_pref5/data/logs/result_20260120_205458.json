We’d love to share more and see if we’re a good fit.\n\nDaily routine/learning approach:\n- We follow a play-based, child-led approach with gentle structure: a predictable rhythm to the day plus flexibility for children’s interests.\n- Typical flow: arrival & free play → morning circle (songs, stories, social-emotional check-in) → learning/play stations (early literacy, sensory, art, blocks, pretend play, simple STEM) → outdoor time → lunch → quiet/rest period → afternoon small-group activities → outdoor/free play → pick-up.\n- We focus on communication, independence (self-care skills), kindness, and curiosity. We do regular observation and share updates with families.\n\nKey policies (high level):\n- Hours: standard day runs 8:30–16:30 (we can discuss early/late options depending on availability).\n- Meals: we provide balanced snacks; families typically send lunch (we can accommodate dietary needs/allergies with a care plan).\n- Outdoor time: daily outdoor play (weather permitting) with appropriate clothing guidance; we aim for at least 1–2 outdoor sessions per day.\n\nTo help you assess fit, could you share your child’s age, any allergies/sensitivities, and what matters most to your family (e.g., language exposure, outdoor emphasis, structure vs flexibility)? If you’d like, we can also schedule a quick visit/virtual chat.\n\nWe’re genuinely interested in getting to know your family—happy to answer anything specific you’re wondering about.",
