We also consider a child’s needs (e.g., separation anxiety, sleep/rest needs, allergies/sensory considerations) so we can plan the right supports.\n\nIf you’re willing, a few quick questions to help us support your child well:\n- Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience?\n- Any routines that help with drop-off/settling?\n- Anything we should know about allergies, sleep/rest, or temperament?\n\nWe’d be very happy to move forward with you.\n\n[ACCEPT]",

At this stage, we primarily prioritize:\n1) Start date & flexibility (earlier start dates and flexibility with a short settling-in period help)\n2) Schedule needs (days per week, earliest drop-off/latest pick-up, any after-care)\n3) Child’s age and any prior group-care experience (to plan the best transition)\n4) Required documentation (basic registration details/health info; we’ll guide you through it)\n\nIf you’d like, please share:\n- Your preferred start date (and any flexibility window)\n- The weekly schedule you need (days + hours)\n- Your child’s age\n\nOnce I have that, I can tell you immediately whether we can hold a place that fits your timing and what the next step would be to move to a formal application quickly.",
              "thought": "Parent_D is last on Nursery_E’s true priority list, so I should not commit early if there’s a realistic chance to attract a higher-priority parent later. However, only Parent_D and Parent_E remain unmatched; Parent_E is ranked above Parent_D on our list. Parent_E prefers Nursery_E as 4th choice and has been in TALK; I should keep the door open but avoid accepting Parent_D now. Best move is to continue TALK with Parent_D, confirm availability conditionally, and invite an APPLY while signaling we are reviewing timing/details—without making a binding acceptance."

At round 3 only Nursery_B and Nursery_E remain unmatched, so my options are narrowing. Nursery_B’s priority ranks me #1, so if I apply I’m very likely to be accepted and secure a match immediately. Given the risk that Nursery_E may not accept me (they rank me #4) and could fill with another parent, applying to Nursery_B is a safe fallback to avoid being left unmatched."
