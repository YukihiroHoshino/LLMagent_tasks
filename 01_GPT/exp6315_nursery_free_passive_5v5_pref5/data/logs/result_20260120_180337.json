We use positive guidance and consistent classroom expectations.\n\nWhen considering families, we prioritize: (1) alignment with our play-based approach and routines, (2) open communication and partnership, and (3) a child’s readiness to participate in a group setting (with support, of course).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines/needs) and what you’re hoping for in a nursery—then I can be more specific about fit.

Consistency between home and school helps children settle quickly.\n- Alignment with our play-based, routine-driven day: families who value social-emotional growth, independence, and learning through play (rather than a highly academic/worksheet approach).\n- Reliability around schedule & transitions: predictable drop-off/pick-up routines and a plan for who does pickup/backup pickup. We don’t require “perfect” schedules, but consistency matters.\n- Community ties/siblings: nice to have, not required. Fit and partnership come first.\n\n(2) Family situations/commitments that are often a strong fit\n- Families who can support a steady routine at home (sleep/meals) and reinforce independence skills (handwashing, dressing attempts, cleaning up).\n- Families comfortable with lots of outdoor time and a child-led, exploratory classroom.\n- Families who can commit to timely communication (e.g., letting us know about absences, changes in pickup, health updates) and who are receptive to regular check-ins during the settling-in period.\n\nIf you’d like, share:\n1) Your child’s age and current nap/rest needs,\n2) The schedule you need (days/hours) and any fixed constraints,\n3) What you’re hoping to see most in the classroom (outdoor time, gentle transitions, peer socialization, early literacy, etc.).\n\nWith that, I can give you an honest read on fit and what would make an application strongest for Nursery_D.",
