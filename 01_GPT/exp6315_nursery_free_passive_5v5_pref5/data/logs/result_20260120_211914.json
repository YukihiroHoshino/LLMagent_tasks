I can’t share other families’ details, but if you tell me your **child’s age**, **desired start date**, and **schedule needs**, I can confirm whether anything would be a barrier on the logistics/fit side.\n\n**(2) Waitlist**\nYes—if the place is offered to another family and they decline (or don’t confirm in time), we **re-offer** to the next family in line. So applying keeps you “in the running,” even if you’re not the first offer.\n\n**(3) Timeline + steps/documents**\n- **Step 1:** You submit **[APPLY]** when ready.\n- **Step 2:** We confirm a few basics (age/start date/schedule; any key support needs).\n- **Step 3:** If we can move forward, we’ll respond with either an offer or a waitlist position, and if offered, we’ll ask for a **prompt confirmation** (typically within a short window) so we can proceed fairly.\n\nIf you’d like, reply with: (a) your child’s age, (b) ideal start date, (c) days/hours needed, and (d) any key needs (nap, separation support, language environment).
