We support vocabulary through themed weeks and lots of conversation during play.\n\n• Arts & creativity: frequent open-ended art (painting, collage, clay) and music/movement; we focus on process over “perfect” products.\n\nTo help me understand fit: what matters most for your child right now—more outdoor time, language exposure, arts, or social-emotional support?

If a child doesn’t sleep, they can do quiet activities without disrupting others.\n• We follow individual sleep needs as much as possible, especially early on, and we’ll tell you how long they rested each day.\n• Meals: we keep meals unhurried and social, encourage independence (self-feeding, pouring with help), and are mindful about allergies/dietary restrictions. We never force eating; we encourage tasting and model routines.\n\n3) Daily communication\n• Daily summary at pick-up plus a written update (digital message) that typically includes mood/engagement, nap duration, what they ate, and a highlight from the day.\n• For the first couple of weeks, we can do extra check-ins (quick message after drop-off if that helps your peace of mind).\n• If anything notable comes up (tears that don’t settle, bumps, illness), we contact you promptly.\n\nA quick question to help me advise you well: does your child currently nap reliably, and what tends to help most at drop-off (a specific routine, a comfort item, a particular caregiver)?
