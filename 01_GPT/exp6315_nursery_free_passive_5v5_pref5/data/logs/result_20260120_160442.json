Since I haven’t applied to Nursery_D yet and it’s still available, I should apply now to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched if my higher choices don’t come through."

However, since I’m currently paired with Nursery_E and it remains available, keeping E warm as a fallback is prudent without committing yet. I’ve already had multiple TALK messages with E; I should ask for a clear decision timeline/likelihood and signal conditional willingness, but avoid applying until I’m sure B/D are not attainable."

Here’s where things stand:\n\n1) Availability: Yes, we still expect to have one place available this cycle, but it’s limited and we’re moving on a rolling basis.\n\n2) Offer timing: Once we receive a formal application (and, if you’d like, a brief fit-confirming call/tour), we can typically make a decision within a few days. If you apply promptly, we can review you right away.\n\n3) Serious consideration (offer vs. waitlist range): Based on our current position, if your start date/age and needs align with our remaining place, you would be in serious consideration for an offer rather than a “long-shot” waitlist. If there’s a mismatch on timing/requirements, we’d be transparent quickly and discuss waitlist only if it’s genuinely realistic.\n\nTo give you the most accurate read today, could you reply with:\n- your child’s age\n- desired start date and schedule (days/hours)\n- any key needs (nap/separation support, allergies/medical)\n\nIf you want a quick call/tour before applying, send 2–3 time windows and I’ll confirm a slot.
