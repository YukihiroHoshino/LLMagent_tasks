We focus on social-emotional development (emotion naming, turn-taking, conflict resolution, independence skills) alongside language and early numeracy through stories, songs, hands-on materials, and small-group projects—no worksheet-driven instruction.\n\n**Typical daily rhythm:**\n- Arrival + free-choice centers (blocks, pretend play, sensory, art)\n- Morning circle (songs, story, calendar/weather)\n- Small-group activities (literacy/art/STEM exploration)\n- Outdoor play (weather permitting)\n- Lunch + quiet/rest time\n- Afternoon centers + pickup\n\n**Key policies & logistics:**\n- **Hours:** Standard day is 8:30–15:30. Early drop-off / later pickup can sometimes be arranged depending on staffing and capacity—tell me the window you need and I’ll be candid about feasibility.\n- **Meals:** Families typically provide lunch; we support healthy options and accommodate allergies with clear plans.\n- **Outdoor time:** Daily outdoor play is a priority whenever conditions are safe.\n- **Family communication:** Regular updates (brief check-ins at pickup, plus periodic written/photo updates and scheduled conferences). We strongly value consistent, respectful two-way communication.\n\n**What we value most in families:**\nPartnership. Families who communicate openly, align with a play-based approach, support routines at home, and collaborate with us around behavior/social-emotional growth tend to thrive here.\n\nA few quick questions so I can advise on fit:\n1) How old is your child and when are you hoping to start?\n2) Any needs we should plan for (allergies, language support, toileting, separation anxiety, etc.)?\n3) What are your top 2–3 priorities (hours, outdoors, calmer setting, preparation for primary school, etc.)?\n\nIf what you’re looking for matches our approach, you’re welcome to schedule a short visit/tour as a next step—and if timing is important, you can also tell me whether you’d consider applying soon.\n\n[TALK]",
