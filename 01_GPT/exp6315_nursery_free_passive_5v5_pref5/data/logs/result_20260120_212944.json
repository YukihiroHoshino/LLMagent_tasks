We adjust pace based on the child—some need a slower build, others are ready sooner.\n- **Communication:** quick handover at drop-off/pick-up, plus **daily updates** on how the day went (mood/comfort, meals, rest, key activities, any concerns).

I’m glad Nursery_D is on your shortlist.\n\nOur daily routine is structured but play-centered: a calm arrival and free-choice play, a short morning meeting (songs, stories, social-emotional check-in), hands-on learning centers (early literacy, math through manipulatives, sensory, art), outdoor/gross-motor time, lunch, and a quiet rest period, then afternoon small-group activities and free play/pick-up. We use play-based learning with gentle structure—focusing on language development, independence/self-help skills, and positive peer interaction.\n\nFor family involvement, we value consistent communication and partnership: timely updates about routines (sleep, toileting, allergies), responsiveness to messages, and participation in occasional conferences/events when possible. We don’t require heavy volunteering, but we do look for families who collaborate respectfully and support consistent expectations between home and school.\n\nIn terms of what we prioritize in applications: families who are aligned with a warm, predictable routine; children who will benefit from and engage with a play-based setting; and clear communication around any support needs so we can plan well.\n\nIf this sounds like a fit, you’re welcome to apply promptly—happy to review your application as soon as it comes in. If you’d like, share your child’s age, any schedule needs, and anything you think we should know (e.g., allergies, language background, separation/transition needs).",
