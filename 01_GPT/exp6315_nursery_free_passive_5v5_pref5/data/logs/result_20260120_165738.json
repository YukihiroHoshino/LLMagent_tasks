We balance structure with flexibility so children can follow their interests while feeling secure.\n\nApproach to early learning/play: Play-based and language-rich. Staff set up inviting areas (blocks, pretend play, art/sensory, books, puzzles) and observe to extend learning with gentle prompts—supporting social skills, early communication, fine/gross motor development, and early numeracy/literacy through everyday activities.\n\nTransitions: We use consistent cues (songs/visual prompts), give advance warnings (“5 minutes left”), and support children who need extra time with a calm adult and step-by-step choices. For new starters, we plan a gradual settling-in with you and align on comfort items and routines.\n\nCommunication with families: Daily handovers plus regular updates on how your child is doing (mood, meals, sleep, key moments).

Nursery_D’s priority ranks me 1st, so if I apply I’m likely to be accepted and secure a match, but I should first try to preserve the option for B by not committing prematurely. Therefore, I will TALK to Nursery_D to signal interest and ask about timing, keeping flexibility for one more round."
