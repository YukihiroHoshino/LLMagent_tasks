We balance child-led play with gentle teacher-guided activities (language, early numeracy, art, music, and movement).\n\nSocial-emotional development: We focus on naming feelings, practicing turn-taking and conflict resolution, and building independence through consistent classroom expectations. Teachers coach children through peer challenges using calm, simple language and routines.\n\nTransitions for new children: We use a gradual settling-in plan when possible (short initial visits, a consistent key teacher, and a familiar routine). We also communicate closely with families during the first weeks to align on comfort items, separation strategies, and what’s working at home.\n\nHours & flexibility: Our standard day runs 8:30–16:30. We can typically accommodate a slightly earlier drop-off or later pick-up by arrangement, depending on staffing and the specific days needed.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and what kind of transition support has worked best in the past—then I can suggest a settling-in plan that fits.
