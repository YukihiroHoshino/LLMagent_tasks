We focus strongly on social-emotional learning—turn-taking, naming feelings, and problem-solving with peers.\n\nSupporting transitions for new children: We do a gradual settling-in plan when possible (short initial stays that lengthen), a consistent key adult who checks in frequently, and clear goodbye routines. We also partner closely with families—brief daily updates at drop-off/pickup and more detailed check-ins during the first weeks.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and what kind of transition support you think they’ll need (e.g., separation anxiety, nap routine, language needs), I can be more specific.

We also prioritize outdoor time each day (weather permitting), lunch, quiet/rest time, and an afternoon mix of play and small-group activities before pick-up.\n\nApproach to play/learning: we’re play-based and developmentally focused—supporting social-emotional skills, communication, independence, and curiosity. Staff observe children’s interests and plan activities that extend learning (e.g., storytelling, role-play, construction, early science exploration) while keeping routines predictable and supportive.\n\nFamily involvement: we value regular communication (brief daily updates plus periodic check-ins). We also invite families to occasional events (stay-and-play sessions, celebrations, and parent meetings). There’s no requirement for extensive volunteering, but engagement and consistent communication are strongly encouraged.\n\nAdmissions/priority factors: places are limited and we allocate according to our published priority order (e.g., criteria-based priority and then relative priority among applicants). We aim to be transparent: we cannot guarantee a place until we see the full pool of applicants in the process.\n\nIf Nursery_A becomes a serious option for you, I’d be glad to answer any follow-up questions (e.g., your child’s age, start date needs, and what you’re looking for day-to-day) and explain how our setting might fit.

When multiple families are interested, we offer the place to the highest-priority applicant who applies and is ready to proceed.\n\n3) Family commitments/expectations: \n- Hours: we ask families to be consistent with agreed drop-off/pick-up times and to communicate in advance about any changes.\n- Communication: brief daily handovers and responsiveness to messages; we also schedule occasional check-ins.\n- Volunteering: not required, but we do value participation in occasional events (e.g., stay-and-play / celebrations) when possible.\n\nIf Nursery_A is a realistic option for you, the best next step is to submit a formal application promptly so you can be fully considered while the place is still open.
