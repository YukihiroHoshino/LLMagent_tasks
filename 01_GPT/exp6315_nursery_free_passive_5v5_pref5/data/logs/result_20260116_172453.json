I can be flexible on start date and schedule if helpful, and I can submit any required materials immediately (forms, references, proof of address, etc.). If there’s a specific timeline or next step you need from me to finalize a decision, please let me know—I’m ready to proceed right away. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is my 2nd choice and still available. Given capacities are 1 each and several parents rank Nursery_C highly (Parent_E ranks it 1st; Parent_A/Parent_D rank it 2nd; Parent_B ranks it 3rd), competition is likely. However, Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me (Parent_C) 2nd, behind only Parent_B. If I apply now, I have a strong chance unless Parent_B also applies and is unmatched. Waiting risks losing the seat to Parent_E/Parent_D/Parent_A if Nursery_C accepts them before I act, even though I outrank them. I should apply immediately and signal readiness to complete materials quickly."

We’re happy to offer you our open seat this cycle.\n\nNext steps to finalize:\n1) Child’s date of birth/age\n2) Preferred start date (even a range is fine)\n3) Schedule needs (full-time/part-time, key days/hours)\n4) Any important notes (allergies, medical needs, support needs)\n\nOnce you send these, we’ll share the enrollment packet and timeline for completing forms (proof of address, emergency contacts, etc.). We’re looking forward to welcoming your family to Nursery_C.",

Remaining unmatched parents are A, C, D; Parent_B (our #1) is not available this round and may already be matched elsewhere. With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now secures a top-choice match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority parent later. Parent_C also ranks Nursery_C as a top choice, suggesting commitment and match stability."
