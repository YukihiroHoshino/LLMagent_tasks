Our approach is play-based but intentional: language, early numeracy, and self-help skills are built into routines and hands-on activities rather than long “desk-style” lessons.\n\n**Outdoor time:** We prioritize getting outside every day (typically a morning or midday block, plus a shorter second outing when feasible).

I’m glad to share details, and I’ll be candid about flexibility where we can.\n\n**Our approach & daily routine (play-based, structured, nurturing):**\nWe run a predictable rhythm that helps children feel secure while still giving lots of choice and exploration: calm arrival/settling-in → morning circle (songs, stories, sharing) → learning centers (language, early numeracy through games, fine-motor, art/sensory, role play) with a mix of child-led play and guided small groups → **outdoor time daily** (weather permitting) → lunch → quiet rest/reading → afternoon small-group activities and free play/pick-up. A big focus is social-emotional skills (independence, kindness, confidence) and positive guidance with clear routines.\n\n**Schedule options (full-time / part-time):**\nWe can sometimes offer **full-time** or a **set part-time pattern** (e.g., specific days). What’s feasible depends on which days you need, because consistency matters for staffing and for children’s routines. If you tell me your ideal days, I can confirm whether we can accommodate it.\n\n**Early drop-off / late pick-up:**\nWe do have defined drop-off and pick-up windows, and in some cases we can accommodate extended-care needs. If you share your target drop-off and pick-up times, I’ll tell you what’s possible right now.\n\n**Start-date flexibility:**\nWe can occasionally support a **staggered start** or a start within a range (especially if you’re open to a short transition period). If you let me know your preferred start month/date and any hard constraints, I can be specific about options.\n\nTo help me advise accurately, could you share:\n1) your child’s age, 2) the schedule you’re aiming for (days + times), and 3) your ideal start date range?\n\nAlso—since you’re actively comparing this round—what are your top two priorities (e.g., outdoor time, gentle transitions, structure, hours flexibility)? If Nursery_E is in your serious set, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel comfortable; we have limited availability and review applications promptly.",
