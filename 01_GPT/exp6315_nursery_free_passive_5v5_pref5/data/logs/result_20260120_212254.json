Children get both structured moments and plenty of guided free play.\n\nSocial-emotional approach: we focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking and conflict resolution, and build independence through consistent classroom routines. Teachers coach children through peer conflicts with simple language and clear boundaries, and we emphasize kindness, repair, and inclusion.\n\nCommunication with parents: we prioritize proactive, two-way communication—regular updates on how your child is settling in, quick notes on notable moments, and scheduled check-ins. We also welcome parent questions and aim to respond promptly.\n\nOur strengths: a calm, consistent environment; strong teacher-child relationships; and a balance of play-based learning with gentle structure. Families who thrive with us typically value routine, collaboration with teachers, and a warm but clear approach to behavior and social skills.\n\nTo help me understand fit on your side: what matters most to you this year (e.g., language development, social confidence, outdoor time, schedule needs), and does your child tend to do better with predictable routines or more flexible days?",

We emphasize repair and inclusion.\n- Strong communication: quick, practical updates as children settle in, regular check-ins, and responsive two-way communication when questions come up.\n\nWhat we value most in families:\n- Partnership and open communication (sharing what helps your child, and collaborating when challenges pop up).\n- Respect for routines and consistency (it really helps children feel secure).\n- A community mindset—kindness, patience, and support for all children’s growth.\n\nTo understand fit and make this easier for you: what are your top 2–3 priorities this year (e.g., language development, social confidence, outdoor time, schedule/extended care)?

Children who nap sleep on individual mats; those who don’t are supported with quiet activities (books, puzzles) so the room stays calm. We aim for a gentle transition and keep routines steady.\n\nOutdoor time: We plan at least one outdoor block daily (often two shorter blocks—morning and/or afternoon), weather permitting.
