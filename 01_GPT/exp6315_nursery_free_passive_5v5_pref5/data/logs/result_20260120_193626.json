Because our seats are limited, we encourage families who feel we’re a strong fit to apply sooner rather than later.\n\nTo help us understand fit, could you share your child’s age, any specific needs or goals you have for this year (e.g., language, routine, social confidence), and what kind of home–school communication style you prefer?",
