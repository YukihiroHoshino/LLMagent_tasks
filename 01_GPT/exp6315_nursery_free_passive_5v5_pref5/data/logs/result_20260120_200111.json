For children, we look for curiosity, willingness to engage with others, and readiness to practice routines—those can be developed with us over time.\n\nIf you share what you’re hoping for (e.g., play-based vs. more structured, your child’s temperament, any specific needs, and your ideal start date), I can be more specific about fit.
