Check likely competition: Parent_E ranks E 4th, Parent_B ranks E last, Parent_C ranks E 4th, Parent_D ranks E 4th. Nursery_E priority ranks me (Parent_A) 1st, so if I apply I should be accepted over any other applicant. Securing E now guarantees a match; waiting for A is risky because Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_E then Parent_D above me, so I could lose A if they apply. Best strategy: apply to E and commit immediately."
