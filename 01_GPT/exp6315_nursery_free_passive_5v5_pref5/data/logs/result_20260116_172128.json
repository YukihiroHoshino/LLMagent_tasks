Our outdoor space supports gross-motor play (climbing/balancing), ride-ons, balls, chalk, and nature exploration; we also rotate “loose parts” (cones, hoops, ramps) for open-ended play. On bad-weather days we use indoor movement/music-and-motor activities.\n\n(3) Drop-off/pick-up windows + flexibility\nTypical windows depend a bit on the schedule option, but generally:\n- Drop-off: a main window around 8:00–9:30\n- Pick-up: a standard window around 3:00–5:30\nWe can usually accommodate occasional early/late days with advance notice (staffing ratios permitting). If you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up times and how often you anticipate changes, I can tell you what we can reliably support.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise precisely: your child’s age, nap needs, and any allergies/IEP/support needs?

Each child is assigned a key person to ensure continuity and secure attachment.\n\n**Communication with parents:** In the first few weeks we provide frequent check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, plus short updates on how your child is settling. We’re always available for a scheduled chat if anything needs more time, and we share regular observations and photos/notes in line with our communication policy.\n\nIf Nursery_B could be a good fit for your family, I’d encourage you to **apply**—we’re actively considering families now.
