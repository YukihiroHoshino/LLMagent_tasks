If you share your ideal start date and the schedule you’re seeking (full-time vs. part-time, preferred hours), I can confirm fit right away and guide next steps.\n\nIf you’re ready, feel free to submit an application this round and we’ll respond immediately.",

Exact ratios depend on age group and day-of-week staffing, but we prioritize stable key-person relationships and low turnover so children have consistent caregivers.\n\n**Start-date flexibility:** We can often accommodate different start dates (including a phased/gradual start) depending on availability and what helps your child settle in smoothly.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and your ideal start window, I can be more specific about the classroom placement, typical group size, and what openings look like.
