If weather is poor, we do indoor gross-motor movement instead.\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time (with flexible quiet activities for children who don’t sleep)\n- Afternoon: small-group activities + free play\n- Pick-up\nWe aim for at least one substantial outdoor block daily; on good-weather days we often add a shorter second outdoor/movement period.\n\n2) Social-emotional development & transitions\n- Consistent routines + visual/verbal cues (“in 5 minutes we’ll tidy up…”) to reduce surprises\n- Small-group guidance: practicing turn-taking, asking for help, naming feelings\n- Positive behavior support: we coach skills (waiting, sharing, calming strategies) rather than using punitive approaches\n- Transition supports: choice within structure (e.g., “Do you want to hop or tiptoe to wash hands?”), and a calm ‘reset’ space if a child is overwhelmed\n- Close family partnership: we align on language/strategies so home and school feel consistent\n\n3) Hours / after-care flexibility\nWe offer standard full-day hours, and we can sometimes accommodate earlier drop-off or later pick-up depending on staffing and availability.

We typically can offer **extended care to 17:00** on weekdays, subject to staffing and advance sign-up (we’ll confirm specifics based on the days you need).\n\n2) **Daily routine / outdoor & play-based learning**: We follow a predictable, play-based routine—morning welcome and free play, a short circle time (songs/stories), child-led learning stations, and **outdoor time daily** (weather permitting). We emphasize social-emotional development, early language, and hands-on exploration; outdoor play is a consistent part of the day rather than an occasional add-on.\n\n3) **Decision timeline / openings**: We’re making offers on a **rolling basis**. If you submit a complete application, we can usually review it **within 24–48 hours** and respond in the next decision window.\n\nTo confirm fit quickly, could you share: **preferred start date**, **days needed**, and whether you need **after-care (until 17:00)**? If Nursery_E is a serious option for your family, you’re welcome to submit an **[APPLY]** and we can move promptly from there.",

Remaining unmatched parents are A, D, E; A is our top choice and also ranks Nursery_E 4th, so we should keep the seat available for A if possible. However, we should still engage D to keep them warm as a fallback if A doesn’t apply. Since Parent_D sent [TALK], we provide program details and timeline, and invite them to share schedule/start date while encouraging an application if Nursery_E is a top choice—without committing the spot."
