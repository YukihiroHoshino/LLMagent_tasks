We also adjust expectations at first—more comfort, more scaffolding around peer play, and gradual independence as the child feels safe.\n\nIf you’d like, share your preferred start date and any routines or sensitivities we should know (separation, nap, food), and we’ll plan the smoothest transition.\n\n[ACCEPT]",

We typically aim to make an offer once we feel there’s a strong fit and we’ve answered key questions (schedule, start timing, and any support needs). If an application comes in, we respond promptly, but we don’t require families to rush if they’re still comparing options.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share a bit about your child (age, temperament, any prior childcare), and what schedule you’re hoping for (days/hours, start date)?
