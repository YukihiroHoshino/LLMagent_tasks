Since this is round 1 and no one is matched yet, I should not lock into my 4th choice immediately.

We’d be very happy to share more.\n\n**What we prioritize when selecting families**\n- **Reliable, consistent schedule**: predictable drop-off/pick-up and clear communication when plans change.\n- **Strong parent–school partnership**: responsive communication, alignment on routines/behavior guidance, and openness to feedback.\n- **Child readiness and wellbeing**: we look for a good fit with our group setting (comfort with short separations, ability to engage in routines with support, and a family approach that matches our calm, nurturing structure). Temperament isn’t judged as “good/bad”—we focus on how we can support the child in a group environment.\n\n**Typical day (high level)**\n- **Arrival & settling-in**: warm welcome, free play/centers.\n- **Morning circle**: songs, stories, simple group activities.\n- **Learning through play**: small-group activities (early language, sensory play, fine motor, social skills).\n- **Outdoor time**: daily when weather allows (we aim for substantial outdoor play).\n- **Lunch** followed by **quiet time/nap** (with individualized support for children who need help settling).\n- **Afternoon play**: indoor/outdoor rotation, creative activities, then pick-up.\n\n**Meals, naps, and routines**\nWe maintain consistent routines and communicate any changes. We also work closely with families on transitions (toileting, naps, separation) with a supportive, step-by-step approach.\n\n**Must-have expectations / constraints**\n- **On-time pick-up** is important (staffing and child wellbeing). If delays happen, we expect prompt notice.\n- **Clear communication** about absences/illness, and respectful, timely responses to messages.\n- **Consistency**: children tend to thrive with stable attendance patterns.\n\nTo help us assess fit quickly: what schedule are you looking for (days/hours), and are there any non-negotiables for your family (nap needs, allergies, separation concerns, language support)? Also, if Nursery_D turns out to be your first choice, would you be ready to **apply and commit** promptly if we can offer a place?\n\nI’m happy to answer anything else you’d like to know.",
