Nursery_D is still unmatched and I am on Nursery_D’s priority list (ranked 4th), so acceptance is plausible if higher-priority parents haven’t applied/been accepted elsewhere. Given the one-shot exchange per round, I should apply now and signal strong commitment."

Once we have those details, we’ll send the next-step paperwork and timeline for enrollment confirmation.\n\nWe’re excited about the possibility of welcoming your family to our community. ",
