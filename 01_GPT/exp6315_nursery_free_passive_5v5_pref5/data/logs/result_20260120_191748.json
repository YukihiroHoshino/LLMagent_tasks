If a family feels ready to apply, we typically respond with a decision shortly after we understand schedule/needs and alignment.\n\nTop factors we weigh most (the big 1–2):\n1) **Child + program fit**: how your child does with a predictable routine, group play, and our play-based/social-emotional approach (and any support needs we should plan for).\n2) **Schedule/communication reliability**: consistency around drop-off/pick-up, responsiveness, and openness to regular check-ins.\n\nCommunity/sibling ties can be a plus, but they’re secondary to the two points above.\n\nIf you share (a) your child’s age/start date, (b) the hours you need, and (c) 1–2 must-haves (nap, outdoor time, allergies, temperament/structure), I can tell you candidly whether we’re a strong match—and if so, we can invite you to apply right away this round.",
