Here’s a clear overview:\n\n**(1) Ages served + transitions (separation, toileting, naps)**\n- **Ages:** We typically serve children in the early-years range (roughly toddler through preschool). Placement depends on age and space in the appropriate group.\n- **Separation/settling-in:** We use a gradual transition plan when possible (short initial visits, consistent drop-off routine, a key caregiver who becomes the child’s “safe base,” and frequent check-ins with you). We aim for predictable, calm handoffs.\n- **Toileting:** We partner closely with families—following the child’s readiness cues, keeping routines consistent, using positive encouragement (no shaming), and communicating daily progress so home/school stay aligned.\n- **Naps/rest:** We keep a consistent rest window after lunch. Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet activities so the room stays restful.\n\n**(2) Social-emotional learning & behavior guidance**\n- We focus on **co-regulation** first: helping children name feelings, feel safe, and return to calm.\n- Guidance is **positive and consistent**: clear expectations, redirection, offering choices, and teaching replacement skills (e.g., “hands are for helping,” asking for a turn).\n- For repeated challenges, we create a simple plan with you (triggers, strategies that work, consistent language) and track progress together.\n\n**(3) Daily schedule + outdoor time**\nA typical day looks like:\n- Arrival & free play / settling\n- Morning circle (songs, stories, sharing)\n- Learning-through-play centers / small groups\n- **Outdoor time** (weather/safety permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Snack\n- Outdoor or movement + small-group activities\nWe aim for **outdoor play daily**, often more than once when conditions allow.\n\n**What we prioritize when considering families**\nWe look for strong **home–school partnership**: consistent communication, alignment on routines/behavior guidance, and families who value a warm, play-based environment and will work collaboratively if any challenges come up.\n\nA couple quick questions to gauge fit and admissions timing:\n1) Your child’s **age** and any key transition needs right now (toileting, nap changes, separation)?\n2) What’s your **start date** target (and how firm is it)?\n3) If after this conversation it feels like a fit, are you considering **applying soon**, or are you still in an early exploration phase?\n\nI’m glad you’re considering us seriously—happy to tailor details once I know your child’s age and your priorities (hours, temperament, outdoor/structure balance).",

In the current unmatched set (A, D, E), I have relatively strong priority at Nursery_D (2nd after Parent_D), while at Nursery_A I am 3rd and at Nursery_E I am 1st. However, Parent_D is likely to target Nursery_B/C first and might not end up at D; Parent_E likely targets C/D/A and has higher priority than me at A and B, but not at D (they are 4th). Since we are directly paired with Nursery_D this round and I haven’t applied anywhere yet, it’s prudent to apply now to secure a safe match, given my good priority here and the limited remaining capacity."

Since I can only send one message this round and E is on my list, I’ll continue TALK with a light signal of seriousness and ask for their key admissions priorities + whether they see potential fit, to decide whether to APPLY next round if A doesn’t work out."

I can’t promise a place based on conversation alone, but from what you’ve shared so far, it sounds *potentially* workable pending age group and start-date details.\n\nTo give you the most accurate read on likelihood, could you share:\n1) your child’s **age** (and any key transition needs: toileting/naps/separation), and\n2) your **ideal start date** and weekly schedule?\n\nI’m happy to respond candidly once I have those two pieces.",
