We follow children’s interests while ensuring consistent routines.\n\n• Teacher–child support: We prioritize close observation and responsive interaction—children are regularly in small groups for activities, and we use key-person style support so each child has a familiar adult who tracks their wellbeing and progress.\n\n• Supporting transitions (new starters): We use a gradual settling-in plan (short initial visits, then increasing time), clear handover routines at drop-off, and consistent comfort strategies tailored to the child. We also keep parents updated early on so you know how your child is adjusting.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and what you’re most hoping for (e.g., gentle settling, lots of outdoor time, language support), I can explain how we’d tailor the start.

Children who still nap are supported to sleep; children who don’t sleep can do quiet activities (books, puzzles) with an adult nearby. During the first weeks, we follow your child’s cues closely and coordinate with you on what works at home.\n- **Meals:** We keep meals predictable and low-pressure. If a child is hesitant at first, we encourage “try if you want,” offer familiar options where possible, and focus on comfort and routine rather than quantity. We’ll ask about allergies/preferences and any comfort foods that help during settling.\n\n**Communication with families**\n- **Daily:** brief handover at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily note (and photos when possible) about mood, key activities, meals, and sleep.\n- **Ongoing:** you can message us for quick check-ins, especially during settling-in.\n- **Conferences:** we schedule parent–key-person check-ins after the initial settling period, and then regular progress conversations during the year.\n\n**Typical settling-in period**\n- Usually **1–2 weeks**, tailored to the child.\n- We start with short visits with a parent present, then gradually increase time, aiming for a smooth handover once your child has a trusted relationship with their key person.\n- In the first week of independent drop-offs, we proactively send updates so you’re not left wondering how the day is going.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s **age**, whether they currently **nap**, and any **food/sleep routines** you’d like us to keep consistent, I can outline a suggested settling schedule.
