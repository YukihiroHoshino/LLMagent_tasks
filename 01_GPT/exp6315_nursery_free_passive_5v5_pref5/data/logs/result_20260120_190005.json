Teachers use consistent language (e.g., “stop, say how you feel, ask for a turn / offer a trade”) and we partner with families so strategies are consistent between home and school. We also build independence through small responsibilities (clean-up jobs, self-help skills), which tends to reduce frustration and boost confidence.\n\nDaily communication: We do a combination of (1) brief daily updates (meals/rest/notes), (2) weekly highlights (photos/what we’re working on), and (3) quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when needed.

Practical logistics like **pickup/drop-off reliability** and commute also matter because they affect day-to-day stability for the child.\n\n(2) **How quickly we expect to fill / flexibility later:** we *can* fill quickly if a family that’s a strong fit applies, so there isn’t a guarantee we’ll still have space later. That said, if our top-fit applications don’t materialize immediately, we may still be open in later rounds—so timing depends heavily on who applies and when.\n\n**What helps an applicant stand out (even without a formal priority category):** being very clear that Nursery_E is a serious option, sharing a concrete schedule (days/hours), confirming you’re ready to commit if accepted, and demonstrating predictable routines (who does pickup, backup plan, etc.).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your ideal weekly schedule + start date and how flexible you are—then I can be more specific about whether you look like a strong fit on our side if you decide to apply.",
