Exact grouping can vary slightly year to year based on cohort size, but we keep ratios appropriate and do small-group activities within the room so children are met at their level.\n\n**Typical daily schedule (example)**\n- Arrival + settling-in / free-choice play\n- Morning circle (songs, stories, routines, social-emotional skills)\n- Learning centers (sensory, blocks, pretend play, early literacy/numeracy, fine-motor)\n- Outdoor play (daily when weather is safe)\n- Lunch\n- Nap/quiet rest (age-appropriate; quiet alternatives available for non-sleepers)\n- Afternoon small groups (art, music/movement, early science/nature, pre-writing/fine motor)\n- Snack\n- Outdoor/free play + pick-up and handover\n\n**Play-based vs. structured learning**\n- Our core is **play-based and child-led**, with educators setting up intentional environments and “provocations.”\n- We add **light structure** through predictable routines, short whole-group moments (circle/story), and **small-group** activities for early literacy, numeracy, and self-help skills.\n- We focus on language development, independence, and social skills—while still giving children long blocks of uninterrupted play.\n\n**Hours & calendar**\n- Our standard hours are weekday daytime; closures generally follow major public holidays plus a small number of staff training days. If you tell me what hours you need (drop-off/pick-up window) and your start date, I can confirm whether we match your schedule and share the specific closure list.\n\n**Key policies (high level)**\n- **Meals:** Families typically provide packed lunch/snacks unless otherwise arranged; we can accommodate common allergies with clear guidelines.\n- **Naps:** Daily rest time; we support individual sleep needs within a consistent routine.\n- **Outdoor time:** We aim for outdoor play every day (weather/air-quality permitting), so we encourage weather-appropriate clothing.\n- **Health/sick policy:** Standard exclusion guidance for fever, vomiting/diarrhea, and contagious conditions.\n- **Guidance/behavior:** Positive guidance, consistent boundaries, and close family partnership.\n- **Parent communication:** Daily brief handover at pick-up plus periodic updates; conferences available.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what is your child’s age, what hours do you need, and what are your top 2–3 priorities (e.g., outdoor time, nap flexibility, school-readiness, language support)?

If you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (and which days), I can confirm what’s feasible for your family.\n\n2) **Child-to-staff ratios (by age)**\n- We staff to age-appropriate ratios and keep groups small, with additional support during higher-need transition periods. Because exact room composition can shift with the cohort (and enrollment timing), the cleanest way to give you the precise ratios for your child’s age band is to confirm your child’s age and intended start date.\n\n3) **Settling-in / transition for new children**\n- We use a **phased settling-in** approach: typically a short initial visit, then gradually increasing time over several days (or longer if needed).\n- We can include a **brief parent stay-in** at the start if it helps your child, then we transition to short separations and build up.\n- We prioritize consistency (same key educator), predictable routines, and frequent check-ins with you during the first 2–3 weeks.\n\n4) **Waitlist pressure for this intake**\n- Interest is active and places can move quickly. We don’t want families to feel rushed, but if Nursery_E is a serious contender, submitting an **application** is the best way to be considered for the current intake and to keep options open while you compare.\n\nIf you reply with: **child’s age**, **start month**, and your **needed hours**, I’ll respond with the most specific details we can share for your situation (including what extended-care flexibility looks like and the applicable ratio band).",

The main factor that helps most is clarity that you can move forward promptly if we extend an offer.\n\nTo make sure we’re aligned before you apply: what are your top 1–2 priorities for your child (e.g., structure vs flexibility, social-emotional focus, schedule), and if offered, what timeline would you need to confirm?",
