We keep transitions consistent with visual/verbal cues and a “same order each day” structure so children know what to expect.\n\nTeacher-to-child approach: Our staff use a supportive, responsive style—observing first, then scaffolding (offering just enough help to extend play/skills). We emphasize social-emotional learning (naming feelings, coaching turn-taking, gentle boundary-setting) and strong home–school communication.\n\nTypical hours: Our standard day runs 8:30–15:30, with options for earlier drop-off and later pick-up depending on availability. If you share your needed schedule, I can confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nSupporting new children: We use a gradual-entry plan when possible (shorter first days, a consistent key teacher, and a simple goodbye routine). We also check in with families frequently during the first few weeks and adjust supports based on how your child is settling.\n\nFamily expectations: Consistent attendance when possible, timely drop-off/pick-up, and partnership with teachers (sharing any changes at home, developmental goals, and what helps your child regulate). We also encourage families to reinforce simple routines (independent dressing attempts, handwashing, etc.).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and any transition needs (e.g., separation anxiety, language background, nap routine).

After lunch we have a calm rest/quiet time, then afternoon activities and outdoor play, and a structured but relaxed pick-up window.\n\nSocial-emotional development: We focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking, and build independence through consistent routines. Teachers model and coach conflict-resolution (e.g., “stop/ask/help” language), use positive reinforcement, and do regular small-group work on empathy and friendship skills. We also communicate closely with families so strategies are consistent between home and school.\n\nHours/after-care: Our standard program runs on a full-day schedule with an optional after-care extension (subject to availability).
