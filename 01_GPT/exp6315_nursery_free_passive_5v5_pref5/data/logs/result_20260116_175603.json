If you share your child’s age and your preferred start month (and days/hours needed), I can tell you what’s realistic right now.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, could you share:\n- your child’s age and any prior childcare experience,\n- temperament (slow-to-warm vs. eager to jump in),\n- any nap needs/allergies or support needs,\n- ideal schedule (full-time/part-time) and start window?\nIf Nursery_E is still a strong contender after that, you’re welcome to submit an application so we can consider you formally as soon as we confirm fit and timing.",
