We prioritize outdoor time daily (weather permitting) with both gross-motor play and nature exploration. Language development is woven throughout the day—lots of conversation, vocabulary-building during play, and small-group story time.\n\nWhat we emphasize most:\n- Play-based learning with guided small groups\n- Social-emotional skills (sharing, self-regulation, kindness)\n- Daily outdoor time and movement\n- Strong communication/language routines (stories, songs, talk during play)\n\nTimeline: we expect to start finalizing offers as families submit applications over the next few rounds, and we typically confirm as soon as we find a strong fit and have capacity. If Nursery_E is a serious option for you, applying sooner helps us consider you while we still have an open seat.\n\nIf you don’t mind, what matters most to your family (outdoor time, language, schedule/extended care, temperament fit)?
