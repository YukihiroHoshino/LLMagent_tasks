Practically, that means we can review and respond within the next round or two once applications come in.\n\nOn capacity: we do still have the spot open right now, and we *can* consider your application in the next round or two. The only caveat is that if we receive an application from a family that is higher in our priority order and ready to commit, we may need to act quickly.\n\nIf you’re seriously considering Nursery_E, two quick questions will help me advise you honestly:\n1) Where do you expect to rank Nursery_E among your final choices (e.g., top 1–2 vs. backup)?\n2) What start date/schedule are you aiming for?\n\nIf Nursery_E is a top choice for you and you’re ready to proceed, applying in the next round would give you the best chance while the spot is still available.",

We should not commit early; instead, keep them engaged while signaling that our single spot may be allocated to higher-priority applicants if they apply.
