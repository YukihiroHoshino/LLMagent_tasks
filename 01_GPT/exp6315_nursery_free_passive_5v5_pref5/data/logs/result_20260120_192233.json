If you’re considering applying, submitting promptly is helpful so we can review you in the active pool.\n\n**What we prioritize in selection**\nWithin our admissions process, we generally prioritize:\n- **Best fit with our program** (alignment on play-based learning, daily routine, and family–school partnership)\n- **Child’s needs and how we can support them** (transitions, any learning/support needs, allergies/health considerations)\n- **Practical fit** (schedule/attendance needs and our ability to meet them consistently)\n\nIf you’d like, share a bit about your child (age, temperament, any routines/support needs) and your preferred schedule. If Nursery_E feels like a strong fit after that, you’re very welcome to submit a formal application promptly and we’ll review it as soon as it’s received.\n\n[TALK]",

Yes, we are able to make a final decision this round.\n\nThe only outstanding item is procedural: because your message is tagged **[TALK]**, I’m not permitted to issue a formal **[ACCEPT]**/**[REJECT]** in this step.\n\nPlease send a short message tagged **[APPLY]** (one line is fine). To finalize immediately upon receipt, please include (brief is OK):\n1) Child’s age/date of birth\n2) Preferred schedule (days/hours) + earliest start date\n3) Any allergies/medical needs\n4) Any learning/support or transition considerations\n\nAs soon as we receive your **[APPLY]** with the above, we will respond immediately this round with our final decision.",
              "thought": "Parent_D is on our true priority list but ranked lowest. It is round 30 and Parent_D is the only unmatched parent; leaving the spot unfilled is worse than matching with an included parent. However, the parent sent [TALK], so we cannot finalize with [ACCEPT]/[REJECT] this step; we must request an [APPLY] message and specify the exact outstanding item (procedural tag + essential details) to finalize immediately upon receipt."
