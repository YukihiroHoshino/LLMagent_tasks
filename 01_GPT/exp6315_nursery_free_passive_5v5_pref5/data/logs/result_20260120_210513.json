We encourage brief, confident goodbyes (not prolonged), then we redirect quickly into a preferred activity. We’ll also coordinate comfort items (small toy/photo) and can do a gradual start plan if needed (shorter initial days) when feasible.\n\nCommunication: we do a daily written summary (meals/naps/mood/activities), and we share photos a few times per week (more during special activities). For the first 1–2 weeks we can provide extra check-ins if a child is having a tough transition.\n\nIf helpful, tell me your child’s age and any nap routine or separation patterns you’ve seen—then I can suggest what the first week might look like.
