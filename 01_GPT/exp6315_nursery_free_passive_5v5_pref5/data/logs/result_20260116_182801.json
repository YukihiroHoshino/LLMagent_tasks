We focus on gross-motor play, nature exploration, and cooperative games\n- **Lunch & hygiene routines**\n- **Nap/quiet time:** consistent routine; children who don’t sleep have quiet activities\n- **Afternoon:** snack, outdoor/active play, and rotating projects (crafts, pretend play, building, language games)\n\n**Settling-in approach:**\n- We use a **gradual transition** when possible (shorter initial days, then building up).\n- A **key-person approach**: one primary staff member focuses on your child’s comfort and communication with you.\n- Consistent goodbye routine, comfort items allowed, and we coordinate closely on sleep/food/comfort cues.\n\nTo help us understand fit, could you share your child’s age and any routines (nap, separation experiences, allergies) we should know about?

We keep transitions calm and consistent so children know what to expect.\n\nTeacher–child ratio: We staff in line with (and typically better than) local requirements; most of the day your child is with a consistent lead teacher plus an assistant in the room to keep groups small and support individual attention. If you share your child’s age, I can give the exact ratio for that classroom.\n\nSettling-in approach: We use a gradual, child-led settling-in plan over the first 1–2 weeks. Typically this starts with short visits with a parent/caregiver present, then brief separations, building up to a full session as your child shows readiness. We also assign a key person who becomes the main point of comfort and communication, and we send frequent updates during the first days.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age, start date, and any routines or sensitivities (sleep, separation, allergies), I can outline a suggested settling-in schedule.

I’m glad Nursery_E is on your serious-consideration list, and I’m happy to share how we work.\n\nChild-led vs. structured: We use a balanced approach. Each day has a predictable structure (so children feel secure), with plenty of child-led choice within that structure. Typically we do short, teacher-guided moments (morning circle, small-group literacy/numeracy/sensory) and then longer blocks where children choose activities/centers and educators extend learning through observation, questions, and gentle scaffolding.\n\nFamily communication: We prioritize consistent, practical updates. Families receive daily notes on key moments (mood, activities, naps, meals), and we also share photos when permitted. In addition, we schedule regular check-ins/meetings (and of course can set up an extra meeting if something comes up). Quick messages at drop-off/pick-up are encouraged, and we’re responsive if you need to reach us during the day.\n\nSettling-in (transition support): We do a gradual settling-in plan tailored to the child—shorter initial stays, a consistent key educator, and predictable routines. We work with you on comfort items, separation strategies, and what helps your child regulate (songs, books, sensory tools). We also communicate more frequently during the first couple weeks so you know how the transition is going.\n\nTypical day (outdoor, naps, meals): We aim for outdoor time daily (weather permitting), usually a substantial block in the late morning and/or afternoon. After lunch we have a quiet rest/nap period with calming routines; children who don’t sleep can do quiet activities. Meals are structured and supervised, with attention to allergies and dietary needs—if you share your requirements, I can confirm how we’d accommodate them.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be specific about fit and availability: What is your child’s age, and what start month/schedule (full-time vs. part-time, days per week) are you aiming for?

We’d be very happy to offer your family our available place at Nursery_E.\n\nTo finalize, could you please confirm (1) your child’s age/date of birth, (2) your preferred start date, and (3) the schedule you’re seeking (full-time/part-time, days per week)? If there are any allergies or key care notes we should plan for, feel free to include those as well. Once I have that, we’ll send the enrollment/settling-in plan details and proposed first days.\n\nWe’re looking forward to welcoming you.",

Nursery_D’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Parent_D), which gives me a decent chance if Parent_D is not also applying here.
