I have top priority at Nursery_A, meaning an application is very likely to be accepted immediately and would secure a solid match. However, I may be able to obtain Nursery_C (my 1st choice) since Nursery_C prioritizes me 4th and several others (B,C,D) may apply there first; still, my top priority at Nursery_B and Nursery_A gives me safe fallbacks. In round 1 with random pairing, securing Nursery_A now avoids the risk of ending with a worse option later (Nursery_E or Nursery_B), and Nursery_A is still above those. Therefore, I should apply to lock in Nursery_A."

In round 1 it’s better not to lock in a lower choice immediately, especially since I have a decent priority position at my top options (I’m 4th at B, 3rd at C, 2nd at A). I should keep Nursery_E warm as a fallback without applying yet. Also, Nursery_E’s priority list ranks me last, so an early apply is unlikely to be accepted if they have interest from others; better to talk and signal continued interest while I pursue higher-ranked nurseries in future rounds."
