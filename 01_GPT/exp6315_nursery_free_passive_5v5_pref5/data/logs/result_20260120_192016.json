In the remaining market, A/D/E are unmatched; I have relatively strong priority at Nursery_A (#2) and Nursery_D (#1), but Nursery_E ranks me last, so an application to E is unlikely to be accepted if others apply. Since I haven’t spoken with Nursery_E yet and applying now could waste a round, I should first gather info and keep E as a fallback while preserving flexibility to apply to A (higher) soon."

Once we have a complete application (and enough detail to confirm fit), we can often make a decision within ~1–2 weeks, sometimes sooner.\n\nIn terms of whether it makes sense to apply now: if Nursery_E is a genuine option for you, applying this round is the best way to be considered in the current review flow. We do continue speaking with multiple families in parallel, so I can’t promise an immediate offer without seeing your details—but we won’t keep you waiting unnecessarily.\n\nIf you share your preferred start date, the hours you need, and anything important about your child’s temperament/routine (and any specific needs), I can give you a candid read on fit and likely timing from here.",
