We also plan staffing to keep the **same core team** with the group as much as possible (limited rotation, predictable coverage when someone is out).\n\n2) **Communication with families**\n- **Daily**: quick drop-off/pick-up handover plus a short written update (highlights, meals/rest, notable moments).\n- **As needed**: we’ll message/call promptly if anything comes up (health, big emotions, incidents, or a breakthrough we want you to know about).\n- **Regular touchpoints**: scheduled check-ins after the initial transition period, and **family conferences** at least once per year (more often if helpful). We aim for very open, collaborative communication.\n\n3) **Biggest strengths of Nursery_D**\n- **Warm, structured play-based learning**: a calm rhythm to the day with lots of hands-on play, language-building, and social learning.\n- **Transition support**: we’re proactive and flexible in the first weeks—gradual separation when needed, consistent routines, and frequent updates.\n- **Social-emotional focus**: we explicitly coach sharing, turn-taking, feelings language, and problem-solving in age-appropriate ways.\n\nIf you’re moving toward application decisions, it would help to know: (a) your ideal start date and schedule, and (b) what matters most for your child right now (e.g., outdoor time, gentle structure, language development, separation support). If Nursery_D is a top contender, I’m also happy to set up a brief call to talk through fit and timing so you can decide with confidence.\n\n[TALK]",
