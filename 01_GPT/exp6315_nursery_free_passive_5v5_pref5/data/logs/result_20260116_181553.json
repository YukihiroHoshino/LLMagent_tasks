              "message": "Hello Parent_C—thank you for reaching out. We’d be very happy to share more about Nursery_E.\n\nDaily routine: We keep a predictable rhythm (welcome/settling, play-based learning blocks, small-group activities, outdoor time, lunch, rest/quiet time, and an afternoon choice/play period). We balance structure with flexibility so children feel secure while still following their interests.\n\nTeacher-to-child approach: We use a warm, responsive approach—teachers observe closely, narrate and extend children’s play, and scaffold social/emotional skills (turn-taking, emotion naming, problem-solving). We also use small-group moments for early language, pre-literacy and numeracy foundations in a developmentally appropriate way.\n\nTransitions/settling-in: We run a gradual settling-in plan tailored to each child (short initial stays, consistent key-person contact, and clear handover routines). We focus on building trust first—familiar routines, comfort items if helpful, and frequent communication with parents during the first weeks.\n\nStrengths for a child starting this year: (1) strong emotional support and consistency through a key-person style of care, (2) lots of language-rich interaction, and (3) a calm, well-structured day with plenty of play and outdoor movement.\n\nTo make this more specific: what is your child’s age and temperament (e.g., slow-to-warm vs. very outgoing), and are there any particular needs you’d like us to support (sleep, separation anxiety, language, social confidence)?",

Since this is round 1 and I’m directly paired with Nursery_A, applying now could secure a solid match without risking losing out later, while still leaving B/C uncertain.

Waiting for Parent_E is risky because Parent_E ranks Nursery_A third and may match with Nursery_C or Nursery_D; Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_E relatively high and Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C.
