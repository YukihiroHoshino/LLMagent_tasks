Family involvement is appreciated (reading updates, occasional events), but **it’s secondary** to schedule fit and day-to-day partnership.\n\n**Competitiveness**\nYes—this last place is **likely to be competitive**, including from families we already know are a strong fit for our program. If Nursery_E is a real option for you, I’d recommend applying sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you share (a) your child’s age, (b) days/hours needed, and (c) ideal start date, I can tell you quickly whether we’re likely to be a strong match on our side—and if so, we can move fast once you submit an application.",
