We value two-way communication so we can align on routines and goals.\n\n**What we look for in applicants**\nWe look for a good partnership fit: families who value consistent routines, support positive peer interactions, and communicate openly (especially around transitions, allergies/health needs, and any developmental goals).\n\nTo help me advise you best: what matters most to you right now—routine/structure, outdoor time, language development, social-emotional focus, or something else? And what schedule are you hoping for?\n\nIf Nursery_E is feeling like a strong fit after this, you’re very welcome to apply—I'd be glad to continue the conversation and answer anything specific about your child’s needs.",

We keep routines predictable while adapting to each child’s needs.\n\n**Settling-in:** we use a gradual transition—typically starting with short visits with a caregiver, then brief separations, building up to a full session at the child’s pace.

Safety is always the priority, but we aim to be supportive rather than punitive.\n\n3) **Typical day (outdoor time, naps, meals)**\n- **Arrival & free play / settling in**\n- **Morning circle + small-group activity** (language, sensory, art, early numeracy through play)\n- **Outdoor/gross-motor time** (we aim for **daily outdoor time**, weather permitting)\n- **Lunch**\n- **Rest/nap window** (quiet rest for non-nappers)\n- **Afternoon exploration + snack + pickup**\nWe can share a sample schedule with exact times based on your child’s age group.\n\n**Key dates / steps if you want to move quickly**\n- The next step is a short **application + a brief family conversation** (10–15 minutes) so we can confirm fit and practical details (start date, schedule, any allergies/support needs).\n- If you’d like to move quickly, I can prioritize scheduling that conversation within the next few days.\n\nIf you tell me (a) your child’s age, (b) desired start date, and (c) the schedule you need, I’ll confirm which group you’d likely join and what availability looks like.

I know I’ve already formally applied, and with round 29 underway and your place appearing to be the only remaining open spot, I want to confirm I can accept immediately and complete any paperwork today.\n\nCould you please confirm whether you are still actively holding the seat for any higher-priority families on your list (Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_B, or Parent_E) who are actually still available and in contention? If not, I’d be very grateful if you could finalize the offer to me this round so we can close everything out before the process ends.",

It is the only unmatched nursery at round 29, so my best achievable outcome now is to secure Nursery_E rather than risk ending unmatched at round 30. I already submitted a formal application earlier, so I cannot [APPLY] again; I should send a final, clear commitment message and request immediate confirmation. Nursery_E’s priority ranks me last, but if all higher-priority parents are already matched (likely given only Nursery_E remains), they should be able to accept me now. I will use [TALK] to press for finalization this round."
