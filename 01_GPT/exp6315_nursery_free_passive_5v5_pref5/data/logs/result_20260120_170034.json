We use consistent classroom expectations and positive reinforcement, and we communicate with families about goals and progress.\n\nSchedules: we typically offer a standard full-day schedule, and we can sometimes accommodate staggered drop-off/pick-up windows depending on staffing and the child’s adjustment plan. If you share the schedule flexibility you need (days/hours, any constraints), I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nA couple quick questions so we can confirm fit: what’s Parent_A’s age and start date you’re aiming for, and do you prefer full-day or a specific pickup time?
