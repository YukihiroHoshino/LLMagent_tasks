We also do daily check-ins with families (how the day went, eating/resting, comfort strategies) and adjust pacing based on the child’s cues.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and any specific needs (sleep, separation anxiety, language, allergies), I can explain exactly how we’d tailor the transition.
