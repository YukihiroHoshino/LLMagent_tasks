We keep transitions calm and predictable.\n\nApproach to learning/play: play-based and relationship-centered. We focus on curiosity, communication, and confidence—staff observe children’s interests and scaffold learning through open-ended materials, routine-based independence, and lots of outdoor time.\n\nHours/flexibility: we offer standard full-day places, and we can sometimes accommodate slightly staggered drop-off/pick-up depending on the family’s schedule. If you share your ideal hours, I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nWhat we value in families: consistent communication, alignment with a play-based approach, and a partnership mindset (sharing routines, any support needs, and being responsive if we flag something).\n\nAvailability: we currently have limited availability for one place, and we’re prioritizing families who feel Nursery_E is a strong fit.

Also, Nursery_E ranks me #1 in their priority list, so an application should be accepted and secure a match immediately."
