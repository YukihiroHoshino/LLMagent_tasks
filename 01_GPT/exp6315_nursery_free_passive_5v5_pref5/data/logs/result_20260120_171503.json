If you share the days per week you need and your ideal start/end times, I can confirm what we can accommodate right now.\n\n**Transition support (the first weeks):** We take transitions very seriously and tailor them to the child. Common supports include:\n- A **gradual start** (shorter initial days if helpful)\n- A consistent key staff member helping your child settle\n- Clear, predictable goodbye routines (we’ll coach you on what works)\n- Frequent updates in the early days (so you’re not left guessing)\n- Comfort items allowed when appropriate, and we work gently on separation anxiety\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn a bit about your child (age, temperament—slow-to-warm vs. eager to jump in, any prior childcare experience) and the schedule you need.

I have not applied to Nursery_D yet. Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me 4th, but acceptance depends on whether higher-priority parents are already matched elsewhere; given we are late in the process, they may be.
