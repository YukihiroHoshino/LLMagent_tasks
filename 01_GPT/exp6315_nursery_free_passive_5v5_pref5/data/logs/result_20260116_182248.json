We emphasize play-based early learning—language through stories and conversation, early numeracy through games and routines, and social-emotional skills through guided peer interaction and consistent classroom expectations.\n\nSettling-in support (first weeks): We use a gradual transition when possible—short initial days, a consistent key-person approach, and close communication with families. We keep routines very consistent early on, offer comfort objects, and share brief daily updates so you know how your child is adjusting.\n\nHours & flexibility: Our typical hours are 8:30–17:30. We can usually accommodate a slightly earlier drop-off or later pick-up by arrangement, depending on staffing and the specific days needed.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and any particular needs (sleep, separation anxiety, allergies, languages at home), and what hours you’d ideally use.

We emphasize routines that build independence (handwashing, tidying, turn-taking) and lots of guided peer interaction.\n\n**Social-emotional approach:** We explicitly teach emotion labeling, conflict-resolution scripts (“I feel… I need…”), and gentle boundary-setting. Staff use consistent, calm coaching and reinforce pro-social behaviors through modeling and small-group practice.\n\n**Communication with parents:** Daily quick updates at pickup plus regular written updates (highlights/what we practiced), and we’re responsive to messages for anything time-sensitive.

Also, competition for Nursery_D seems limited: Parent_E prefers D second but may aim for C first; Parent_C has D third; Parent_B has D fourth.
