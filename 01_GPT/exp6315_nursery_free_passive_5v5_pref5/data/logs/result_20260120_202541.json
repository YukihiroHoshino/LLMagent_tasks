We’d be happy to move forward with you.\n\nDaily routine & balance (play vs. structure):\n- We use a play-based approach with gentle, predictable structure. Children have substantial time in learning-through-play centers (sensory, blocks, art, early literacy/numeracy) alongside short, educator-led moments like morning circle, small-group activities, and routines that help the day feel secure.\n\nSupporting social-emotional development:\n- We explicitly teach skills like turn-taking, naming feelings, gentle boundaries, and problem-solving with peers.\n- Key-person/caregiver approach where possible, consistent routines, and lots of positive reinforcement.\n- Daily communication with families so strategies are consistent between home and nursery.\n\nStandout strengths:\n- Outdoor time is built in daily (weather permitting), with active play and nature-based exploration.\n- Strong arts & creative materials (process-focused art, music/movement).\n- Language-rich environment (stories, songs, conversation, vocabulary-building during play).\n\nNext steps / timeline:\n1) We’ll confirm basic details (child’s age, preferred start date, schedule, any allergies/support needs).\n2) If possible, we’ll schedule a short visit/meet-and-greet.\n3) We’ll then finalize enrollment paperwork and confirm the start plan (including a settling-in schedule).\n\nTo finalize, could you share: your child’s age, your ideal start date, and the days/hours you need?

Current unmatched parents are Parent_A and Parent_E; Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th and may or may not apply. With quota 1 and no current match, accepting Parent_E now secures a match but risks missing Parent_A if they apply later. Given limited remaining pool and uncertainty, accept Parent_E to avoid ending unmatched by round limit."

(2) how do you handle the settling-in period for new children (e.g., phased entry, parent stay-and-play)?

I’m happy to clarify.\n\n1) **Typical hours + routine + outdoor time**\n- **Hours:** We typically run **8:30am–3:30pm** (with **early drop-off from 8:00am** and **late pick-up to 4:30pm** depending on your schedule needs).\n- **Daily flow:** arrival/free play & check-in → morning circle (stories/songs/language) → play-based learning stations (sensory, early literacy/numeracy through games, art, construction, role play) → **outdoor play** → lunch → rest/quiet time → small-group activities + free play → pick-up.\n- **Outdoor time:** Children usually go outside **every day**, typically **45–90 minutes total** (often split into two shorter sessions), weather permitting.\n\n2) **Settling-in (phased entry / parent stay-and-play)**\n- We use a **gradual settling-in plan over ~1–2 weeks** (tailored to the child).\n- It usually starts with a **short stay-and-play with a parent/carer**, then brief independent stays, building up to the full session.\n- Each child has a **key person** to keep routines consistent and help them feel secure.\n- We keep communication close during the first days (quick updates at drop-off/pick-up, and we can agree on check-ins if helpful).\n\n3) **Documents + deadlines**\n- **To apply/enroll:** basic application form, child details, emergency contacts, and any **medical/allergy information**.\n- If offered a place, we’ll ask for: proof of identity/contact details, immunisation/health info as applicable, and consent forms (pick-up permissions, photos, outings, etc.).\n- **Deadlines:** We don’t have a single fixed deadline; places are confirmed once we align on a start date and schedule. That said, if you’re considering starting soon, it’s best to apply as early as possible so we can reserve a slot and plan settling-in.\n\nIf you tell me **your child’s age**, **preferred start date**, and **days/hours needed**, I can confirm what availability looks like and suggest an ideal settling-in plan. If Nursery_D is near the top of your list, I’d also be very happy to arrange a short visit this week so you can see the room and meet the team.",
