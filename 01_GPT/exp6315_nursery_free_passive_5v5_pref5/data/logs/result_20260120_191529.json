After lunch we have rest/quiet time, then an afternoon project/enrichment block (art, music/movement, seasonal themes) before pick-up.\n\nSocial-emotional development: We explicitly teach and coach skills like turn-taking, naming feelings, problem-solving, and gentle conflict resolution. Teachers use consistent routines, positive guidance, and small-group activities to practice friendship skills.

Nursery_A is a top option for our family, and if offered a place we’re prepared to confirm promptly and work with your preferred start date/transition plan. If helpful for your decision, I’m happy to share any additional details about our child’s routine and needs, or arrange a quick call/visit at your earliest convenience.",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is my 3rd choice (after B and C). By round 3, only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched, implying B/C/D likely filled. If I delay, I risk being forced to settle for Nursery_E (my 4th) or potentially unmatched. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 3rd (behind Parent_E and Parent_D). Parent_E prefers C>D>A and may have been rejected elsewhere, so could compete for A; Parent_D prefers B>C>A and could also fall back to A. Given the risk and that A is still acceptable and higher than E, I should apply now and signal commitment while being flexible on start date, to increase acceptance likelihood."

We’d be very happy to offer you our available place.\n\nTo make the transition as smooth as possible, could you please share (briefly is fine):\n- your child’s age and any key routines (sleep/nap, comfort items)\n- any allergies/medical needs\n- preferred start window and weekly attendance pattern\n\nIf you’d like, we can also arrange a quick visit/call to align on the settling-in plan and first-week schedule.

I should secure a match rather than risk ending up with Nursery_A (my last choice). Nursery_E’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_A). Parent_A prefers B then C then A; since A is still unmatched, Parent_A is likely to take Nursery_A, leaving me as the top remaining candidate for Nursery_E.
