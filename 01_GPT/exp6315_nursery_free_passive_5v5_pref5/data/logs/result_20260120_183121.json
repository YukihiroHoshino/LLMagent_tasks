Children who don’t sleep are supported with **quiet rest/quiet activities** after a reasonable attempt to settle, and we coordinate with families on sleep needs.\n\nIf you’re open to it, two quick questions so I can be more specific: **your child’s age** and whether they’re currently **napping daily**.
