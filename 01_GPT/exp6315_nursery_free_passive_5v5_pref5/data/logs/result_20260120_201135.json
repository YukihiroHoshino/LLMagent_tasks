Children spend a lot of time in purposeful play (centers, role play, sensory, blocks, art), and teachers weave in early literacy/numeracy through songs, stories, games, and small-group moments. We focus heavily on social-emotional learning, independence skills, and positive peer interactions.\n\nOutdoor time: Outdoor play is a core part of our day whenever weather is safe—typically at least once daily, often twice (a longer block in the morning and/or afternoon), plus movement breaks.\n\nTypical schedule (example):\n- Arrival & welcome / free play\n- Morning circle (songs, story, planning the day)\n- Learning centers + small-group activities\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon centers / story or music\n- Outdoor or movement / pickup\n\nTransitions for new children: We use a gradual settling-in plan where possible (short initial days, consistent caregiver handoff routine), a key-person approach for attachment and check-ins, and predictable visual/verbal routines. We also coordinate with families on comfort items, separation strategies, and any triggers/support needs.\n\nKey policies (hours/late pickup): We operate on set drop-off/pick-up windows to keep the day predictable for children. Late pickup is discouraged; if it happens, we apply late fees and we’ll work with families early to prevent a pattern. If you share the hours you typically need, I can tell you how well that aligns with our daily flow.\n\nIf you’re open to it, a few quick questions so I can be specific about fit and availability: your child’s age, any allergies/support needs, your ideal start date, and the hours you’d need (earliest drop-off/latest pickup).
