Parent_B prefers Nursery_A first and is ahead of me at Nursery_C, so I may still have a strong shot at Nursery_C.

              "thought": "Nursery_D is my 2nd choice (very high). Remaining unmatched nurseries are D and E; I already applied to C in round 1 (likely rejected/filled since still unmatched list excludes C) and only talked to E. I should apply now to D to secure a strong outcome. Check competitiveness: Nursery_D priority ranks me 4th (after D, A, C). Other parents’ preferences: A and D rank D last; B ranks D 4th; C ranks D 3rd; so likely fewer competitors for D. Applying with commitment may help if they have discretion; at minimum it’s optimal to try now rather than delay to E (4th choice)."

With quota 1 and only Parent_B and Parent_E unmatched, compare: Parent_B is last on Nursery_D’s list, so Parent_E is preferred. Risk of waiting: Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 2nd (after Nursery_C) and could match elsewhere if we reject; accepting now secures a better outcome than holding out for Parent_B. Therefore accept."
