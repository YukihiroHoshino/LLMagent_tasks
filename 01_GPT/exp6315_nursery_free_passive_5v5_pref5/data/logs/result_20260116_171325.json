We balance structure with flexibility based on children’s needs.\n\n**Learning approach:** Play-based and developmentally appropriate, with intentional small-group work to build communication, self-regulation, independence, and early foundational skills. We focus on social-emotional development and routines that help children feel secure and confident.\n\n**Communication with parents:** Regular updates on how your child is doing (highlights, routines, any concerns), quick day-to-day check-ins at drop-off/pick-up, and more detailed touchpoints as needed. We aim for transparent, two-way communication.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re looking for, I’d encourage you to **apply to Nursery_C in an upcoming round**—we have limited capacity and would be glad to consider you promptly.\n\nTo make sure we’re a strong fit, could you share: (1) your child’s age and desired start date, (2) the hours/days you need, and (3) any allergies or support needs we should plan for?",

In practice, classrooms are staffed so children have consistent, familiar adults (rather than rotating coverage).\n- We prioritize continuity: we aim to keep a core team with the group, and we plan schedules so the same key teachers handle arrivals, the main learning/play block, and pickup whenever possible.\n\n2) Transitions & separation support\n- We use a gradual-entry approach tailored to the child (and family). Typically this starts with short visits, then a short drop-off, and builds toward a full session as the child shows readiness.\n- We assign a consistent “primary” teacher for the first weeks so your child has a predictable go-to adult.\n- We use clear routines (arrival ritual, visual cues, a comfort item if helpful) and we’ll coordinate with you on a simple, consistent goodbye plan—warm, confident, and not drawn out.\n\n3) Communication with parents\n- Daily: brief updates at drop-off/pickup plus a short summary of how the day went (mood, play interests, meals/rest highlights, anything we’re working on).\n- Ongoing: we reach out proactively if we notice patterns (sleep/separation/peer dynamics) and we’re happy to problem-solve together.\n- Conferences: we schedule periodic check-ins (and can add one early on after the first few weeks to ensure the transition is going smoothly).\n\nStart date flexibility\n- We can usually be flexible within a reasonable window depending on staffing and the group’s dynamics (for example, aligning a start to the beginning of a week and allowing a gradual-entry plan). If you share your ideal start range, I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what start window are you aiming for, and has Parent_A had prior group-care experience (or would this be a first separation setting)?

Nursery_C remains our first choice, and with the process nearing the end (round 29), I wanted to ask for a definitive update on the remaining place.\n\nIf you are able to offer it to us, we will accept immediately and can complete all enrollment steps today (paperwork + any required documents like proof of address, immunization/medical forms, emergency contacts, references, and a short child profile). I’m also available for a quick call/visit today if that helps finalize.\n\nCould you please confirm whether you can offer us the place, and if a decision is still pending, what exact remaining step you need from us and the specific time by which you will communicate the final decision?",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is my top choice. Only Nursery_C remains unmatched in round 29, so securing this last spot is critical. I already applied earlier, so I should not send another [APPLY]. Given Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me 4th, they may be waiting on higher-priority parents, but with the market nearly over, I should make a clear final, time-bound appeal, emphasize immediate readiness to complete enrollment, and request a definitive decision deadline."
