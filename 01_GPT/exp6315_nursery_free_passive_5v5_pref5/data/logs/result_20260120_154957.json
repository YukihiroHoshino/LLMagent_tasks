We balance child-led play with gentle structure so children feel secure while still exploring.\n\nApproach to learning/play: play-based and language-rich. We use hands-on activities (blocks, sensory play, art, pretend play) to build early literacy/numeracy, social-emotional skills, and independence. Teachers observe and scaffold—stepping in with prompts and extensions when a child is ready.\n\nStart-date flexibility: we can usually accommodate a range of start dates, including phased/gradual starts, depending on enrollment timing. If you share your ideal window, I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nTo help us see if we’re a strong fit: what matters most to your family right now (e.g., outdoor time, structure vs. flexibility, language support, nap schedule, hours)?

Yes, we are actively considering applications for our remaining place, and you’re very much the kind of family we’d like to speak with.\n\nProgram overview: we’re play-based with gentle structure—free play and warm arrival, morning circle/story/songs, small-group activities (early language, pre-math through hands-on play), daily outdoor time, lunch/rest, then afternoon choice centers/projects. We focus a lot on social-emotional development, independence, and a language-rich environment.\n\nDecision timeline: we can move quickly. If you decide Nursery_D is a real option, you can submit an [APPLY] this round and—once we confirm a few basics—we can give a final decision promptly.\n\nWhat matters most in selection: we follow our standing priority order when multiple families are interested, and we also confirm practical fit (start date window, days/hours needed, and any supports that help your child thrive).\n\nTo make this easy, could you share:\n1) your ideal start date window,\n2) the days/hours you need,\n3) anything important we should know about your child’s routines/support needs?\n\nIf you’re ready, feel free to apply this round and we’ll prioritize turning it around quickly.",

Nursery_D ranks me 2nd (after Parent_D), so I have a relatively strong position there as a fallback. I already spoke with D once but have not applied; given limited rounds and risk of ending unmatched, I should apply now to secure a safety option while I likely won’t win B. E is also available and ranks me 1st, but I’m not paired with E this round. Applying to D now may lock me in if accepted; however, securing any match is better than risking none, and D is on my list."
