If weather is truly unsafe, we replace it with indoor movement/gross-motor activities.\n\n2) Social-emotional development + transitions\n- Predictable routines + consistent language (children know what’s coming next)\n- Co-regulation first: teachers help children calm their bodies before problem-solving\n- Explicit coaching: naming feelings, turn-taking, “stop/please” scripts, repairing after conflict\n- Transition supports: 5- and 2-minute warnings, songs/visual cues, “helper jobs,” and small groups when needed\n- Gentle boundaries: clear expectations, choices when possible, and follow-through without shame\n\n3) Parent communication\n- Daily: brief handoff at drop-off/pick-up + quick notes on mood, eating, sleep, and any highlights\n- Weekly: a summary of themes/skills we worked on + photos/short updates\n- Conferences: scheduled check-ins (and additional meetings as needed)\n- Messaging: we’re responsive for practical questions/updates and will proactively reach out if anything significant comes up\n\nIf it helps you decide quickly: what age is your child, and are there any specific needs around transitions (separation at drop-off, nap, sensory sensitivities, etc.)?
