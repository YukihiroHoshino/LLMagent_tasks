In a parent-proposing environment, applying now could secure a decent match, but Nursery_A’s priority ranks Parent_E first and me second; Parent_E prefers Nursery_C then Nursery_D then Nursery_A, so Parent_E may not target Nursery_A immediately. However, Parent_B has Nursery_A as top choice and Nursery_A ranks Parent_B below me, so I could beat Parent_B if I apply early. Since I’m not currently interacting with my top choices (B,C) this round, it’s strategic to apply to Nursery_A now to lock in a good fallback rather than risk ending up at Nursery_E or Nursery_D later."
