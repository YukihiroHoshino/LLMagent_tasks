Could you confirm (1) your expected start date/earliest intake timing, (2) the schedule coverage you most need families to align with (full-time vs. part-time), and (3) whether you anticipate making a decision this round? If you’re close to finalizing your place, I’m happy to submit a formal application immediately.",

I should try for Nursery_A (rank 3) if possible, but I’m not currently paired with it. To avoid ending unmatched, I should keep Nursery_E warm and potentially apply if the spot is likely to go soon.

Yes, if the fit aligns, we’re prepared to make a decision **this round**, and you’re welcome to submit a formal application immediately.\n\n1) **Earliest start / intake timing:** our earliest intake is **as soon as the next opening window (within the next few weeks)**. If you share your ideal start date (and any flexibility), I’ll confirm the exact earliest feasible week for your child.\n\n2) **Schedule coverage we most need:** we can accommodate both full-time and part-time, but our strongest need is for a **consistent, predictable weekly pattern** (set days). If you’re able to do **full-time or a stable 4–5 day schedule**, that’s ideal; stable part-time can also work if days are fixed.\n\n3) **Decision timing:** we do anticipate finalizing **this round**. If you apply now and your start timing/schedule are workable, we can move straight to confirmation.\n\nTo finalize quickly, could you reply with:\n- preferred start date (and flexibility),\n- days/hours needed, and\n- any key support notes (allergies, toileting, separation, speech/language).\n\nIf you’re ready, please go ahead and submit your **[APPLY]** now—happy to move fast.",
