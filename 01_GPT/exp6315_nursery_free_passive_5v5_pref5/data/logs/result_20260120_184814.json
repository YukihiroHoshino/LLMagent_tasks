We balance child-led exploration with teacher-guided small groups.\n\nCommunication with parents: We prioritize frequent, practical updates. Families receive regular check-ins (brief daily notes/at-pickup highlights as needed), periodic classroom updates, and we schedule conferences to discuss development goals and progress. We’re also available for ad hoc conversations if anything comes up—our approach is collaborative and proactive.\n\nIf you confirm your child’s age and preferred start date/schedule, we’ll align you with the right classroom and send next-step enrollment details right away.",
