Since I haven’t applied yet and we’re in round 3, it’s worth applying now to signal strong commitment and flexibility, which might help if others don’t apply or decline.

If Nursery_E is a realistic option for you, applying earlier is the safest way to stay in contention.\n\n2) What we prioritize when choosing among interested families:\nOffers are made primarily according to our admissions priority order. When coordinating timing across families, clear commitment (e.g., Nursery_E being a top choice) and prompt completion of the application/visit steps can help us move quickly.\n\n3) Next steps if you apply later this week:\n- Submit the short application form (basic family details + start date preference).\n- Send any required documents (ID/contact info; any relevant notes you’d like us to consider).\n- We schedule a brief visit/meeting (virtual or in-person) as soon as possible.\n- After that, we finalize the offer when we reach your position in our process and have capacity.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: where does Nursery_E sit on your list right now (top choice / top 2–3 / fallback), and if offered, would you be able to confirm quickly? That helps us advise you realistically on timing.",

Parent_B is only exploring and likely ranks Nursery_E last, so acceptance now is impossible anyway since they are not applying; best move is to encourage a prompt application, clarify that offers follow priority order, and elicit their ranking/commitment to gauge whether to reserve attention or pivot toward Parent_A if contacted."
