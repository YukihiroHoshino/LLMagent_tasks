Student_D ranks us first, so they are likely to remain available for later rounds if not accepted now. With no risk of losing a higher-ranked student by waiting and a reasonable chance to attract A/B/C (who rank us 4th/5th/4th respectively), the optimal strategy is to reject now and keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates, potentially revisiting Student_D later if needed."
