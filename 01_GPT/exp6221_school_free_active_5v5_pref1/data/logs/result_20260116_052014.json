Given all schools share the same priority order (A>B>C>D>E) and students’ preferences show A, B, and C do not rank School_D highly (they place D 4th/5th), it is unlikely they will apply to School_D early; but if they are rejected elsewhere, they could come later. Accepting Student_D now would fill our only seat and prevent matching with any higher-priority student if one later applies. Since we can only respond ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, we should reject to preserve the option for higher-priority candidates."

Given all schools share the same priority list and each student’s first choice is different (A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E), it is very likely Students A–D will match with their first-choice schools, leaving me with no opportunity to enroll a higher-ranked student.
