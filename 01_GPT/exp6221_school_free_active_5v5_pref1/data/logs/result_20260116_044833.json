Student_B prefers School_A first, then School_C, so could apply later if not accepted by School_A. Waiting for a higher-priority applicant risks ending unmatched if they never come, while Student_C is an acceptable mid-ranked candidate who is strongly committed.

Given the market is still active (round 27 of 30) and my stated policy has been to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates until market close, the optimal strategy to maximize my outcome on the true priority list is to continue rejecting Student_E’s apply attempts while keeping the seat open for higher-ranked students.
