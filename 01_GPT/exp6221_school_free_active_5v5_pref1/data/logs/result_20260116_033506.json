Given full information: Student_A prefers E last; Student_B ranks E 4th; Student_C ranks E last; Student_D ranks E last. Demand for School_E is therefore likely low, meaning I may end up unmatched if I reject now, but accepting Student_E would lock in my lowest-ranked option and prevent any chance (however small) of matching with a higher-priority student.
