Also, Student_E is the only student who ranks School_E as #1; higher-priority students (A–D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply. With quota 1 and no other applicants this round, accepting Student_E now secures a filled seat but sacrifices the slim chance of a higher-priority student applying later. Given the environment allows up to 30 rounds, it is rational to wait at least a bit to see if any higher-priority student unexpectedly applies; rejection now may lose Student_E, but they strongly prefer School_E and may re-apply. I will reject this round to preserve the option value of a higher-priority match."

Waiting risks losing my seat if higher-priority students never apply to School_C (they each have higher-ranked schools: A prefers B>A>C, B prefers A>C, so only B might come later; A is less likely).
