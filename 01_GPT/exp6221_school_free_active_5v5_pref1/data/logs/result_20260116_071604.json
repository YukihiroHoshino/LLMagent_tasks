I’m submitting a formal [APPLY] again this round.\n\nSchool_E remains my first choice, and if you extend an offer at any point I will accept immediately and commit to enrolling. I understand you must follow your priority order and are holding the seat in case a higher-priority student (A–D) applies.\n\nIf it helps your process, I’m happy to be treated as a standing/ready candidate: if the seat is still open at a later checkpoint with no A–D in active contention, I would be grateful to receive the offer right away. Is there a specific round or point in the process when you would stop holding the seat and finalize with the highest-priority available applicant? Thank you again for considering me.",
              "thought": "Only School_E remains unmatched, and it is my top true preference. Rejections so far are due to School_E holding the seat for higher-priority students A–D who might apply later. The best move is to continue applying to keep myself in active contention and to emphasize immediate commitment plus willingness to accept a conditional/late-stage offer if no A–D apply. I will also ask for any concrete checkpoint (e.g., a round) when they would stop holding the seat, to reduce uncertainty while staying respectful of their priority policy."

Student_E is applying and would commit, but accepting now would block any chance of matching with a higher-priority student if they later apply. Given other students generally rank School_E last except Student_E, the probability of higher-priority applicants is low but not zero; still, my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list rather than fill early. With no other applicants in the inbox this round and ample rounds remaining (round 8/30), the optimal strategy is to continue holding the seat and reject Student_E for now, while giving a clear checkpoint for when we would finalize if no A–D appear."

However, higher-priority students A–D have not applied yet; given their preferences, they rank School_E last, so probability they apply is low but nonzero (they could be rejected elsewhere in later rounds). Accepting E now would forfeit any chance to match with A–D, which is strictly better on our priority list. With many rounds remaining (current round 9 of 30), it is rational to continue holding the seat for potential higher-priority applicants. Therefore reject E again, while clarifying we cannot disclose other students' communications and restating the condition for later acceptance."

Student_E is repeatedly applying and credibly commits immediately, so accepting now secures a match and avoids leaving capacity unused, with minimal expected opportunity cost given A–D’s weak interest in School_E."
