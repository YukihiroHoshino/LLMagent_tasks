We still have an unfilled seat (quota 1) and no higher-priority applicants (Students A–D) have applied to us in this round or any prior rounds in the provided history. However, accepting Student_E now could prevent us from admitting a higher-priority student if one applies in a later round. Given the market preferences, Students A–D all rank School_E last, so the likelihood they will apply is extremely low unless all other options reject them. With round 10 ongoing and repeated applications from Student_E, the expected value of holding the seat for a higher-priority applicant is low, and leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with Student_E (who is still on our acceptable list). Therefore, accept to fill the quota with the best available applicant who is willing to commit immediately."
