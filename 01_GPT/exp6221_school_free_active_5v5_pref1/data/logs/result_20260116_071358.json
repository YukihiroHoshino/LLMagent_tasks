Rejecting Student_B now risks ending up unmatched or with a lower-priority student later. Accepting Student_B secures a high-priority match within quota and is consistent with their stated first-choice commitment."

However, Student_A/B/C all rank School_D low (4th/5th/4th), so they are unlikely to apply to us early; Student_D ranks us 1st, making them the most likely secure match. Holding out risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply. Therefore accept Student_D now to fill quota with a committed applicant."

With identical priority lists at every school (A highest to E lowest), my acceptance chances are best at a school that other higher-priority students are less likely to rank first. Student_A targets School_B first, Student_B targets School_A first, Student_C targets School_C first, and Student_D targets School_D first, so School_E is likely uncontested in round 1.

Given Student_E lists School_E as first choice, they are likely to commit if accepted. Waiting for higher-priority students (A-D) is risky because all of them rank School_E last and are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. To avoid ending unmatched, it is optimal to accept Student_E now."
