Our chance to land A/B/C is low, and rejecting D risks ending unmatched. Since D is on our acceptable list and is offering immediate commitment, accept to secure a filled seat."

Rejecting to wait for Student_A is risky because Student_A’s first choice is School_B and may never apply to School_A. Given complete information, Student_A will likely pursue School_B first; with identical priorities across schools, Student_A is highly likely to be accepted by School_B, leaving School_A without Student_A.

Since my objective is to match with the highest possible student on my priority list, accepting Student_E now would lock in my lowest-ranked option and eliminate any chance to upgrade within my quota.
