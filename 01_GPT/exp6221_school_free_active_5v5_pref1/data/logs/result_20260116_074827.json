Since I can reject now and keep the seat open, and Student_E has strong outside options (School_B, School_A, School_C, School_D) ahead of their last choice School_D, rejecting does not risk leaving them without options.

However, given full information: Student_A ranks School_E last; Student_B ranks School_E 4th; Student_C ranks School_E last; Student_D ranks School_E last. Thus, only Student_B has any realistic chance of turning to School_E if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now would create a binding match and foreclose the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_B later. With rounds remaining (16/30), it is still rational to hold the seat for potential Student_B application. Therefore reject Student_E again to preserve option value for higher-priority candidates."

Since the objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list, and there are still many rounds remaining (17/30), the optimal strategy is to continue holding the seat for higher-priority candidates and reject E for now, reassessing only very late in the process if still unmatched."
