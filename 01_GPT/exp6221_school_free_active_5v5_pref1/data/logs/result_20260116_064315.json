I am formally applying again this round; if offered the remaining seat, I will accept immediately and commit to enrolling.\n\nGiven we are now in round 18 and School_C is the only school still unmatched, if your higher-priority candidates have already secured placements elsewhere (or you now have enough clarity that the seat can be finalized), I respectfully ask that you reconsider and extend the offer to me this round. I can confirm acceptance right away.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_C",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains available and it is my top true preference. Rejections have consistently cited holding the seat for higher-priority students, but with the market at round 18 and only this school unmatched, it is optimal to continue submitting a clear, immediate-commitment application and request reconsideration if higher-priority candidates have already matched elsewhere or are no longer expected to apply."

Given the current stage of the process and our remaining capacity, we are able to extend you an offer for our remaining seat.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_C.

              "thought": "School_C’s true priority ranks Student_C below Student_A and Student_B. However, by round 18 School_C is the only unmatched school, and Student_C is repeatedly applying with a credible immediate-commitment signal. Given the long history with no contact from higher-priority students and the risk of ending unmatched if we continue holding the seat indefinitely, it is now optimal to fill the quota with the best available applicant who is actively applying—Student_C—rather than remain unfilled waiting for unlikely late applications from higher-priority students."
