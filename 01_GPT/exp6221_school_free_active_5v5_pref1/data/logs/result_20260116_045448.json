Our current plan remains: if we reach roughly rounds 10–12 without receiving an [APPLY] from any higher-priority candidate, we will be in a position to seriously consider filling the seat at that point.

Given students’ preferences: A ranks C third, B ranks C second, D ranks C third; any of them could still turn to School_C if rejected elsewhere. In round 7, it remains plausible that A/B/D are still negotiating and may apply later. Accepting E now would foreclose the chance to match with a higher-priority student, which is my objective. Student_E is only [TALK] this round, so I should respond with [TALK], maintain the checkpoint guidance (rounds 10–12), and avoid promising private signals about other candidates while being transparent that no commitments have been made."

Student_A and Student_B both rank School_C as 3rd/2nd and likely have stronger options (A prefers B then A; B prefers A then C) and may already be matched; Student_D ranks C as 3rd and likely targets D/A first. With only 20 rounds left, continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched, which is strictly worse than accepting a listed student (we only prefer unfilled vs non-listed; E is listed). Student_E credibly commits to accept immediately. Therefore accept now to secure a match rather than gamble for a higher-priority applicant who has not appeared by the agreed checkpoint."
