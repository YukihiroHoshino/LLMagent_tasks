With only one current applicant (Student_B) and no guarantee of receiving Student_A, accepting Student_B secures a strong outcome (2nd on our list) rather than risking an unfilled seat or a lower-ranked student later."

We would place the device only in approved common/classroom locations with staff permission, avoid collecting any personal data, and post a clear note describing what is being measured and why. Data would be logged at set intervals and stored in a shared spreadsheet/dashboard for analysis (trends by time of day, ventilation changes, etc.). We would validate readings with basic calibration checks and document limitations. Final deliverables would be (a) a short report with charts and recommendations, and (b) a brief presentation/poster to share findings with the school community.\n\n2) Welcome/mentor program outline (4–6 sentences):\nMentors would be recruited via Student Council announcements, teacher nominations, and a short sign-up form emphasizing reliability and inclusivity, followed by a brief orientation on expectations and confidentiality. Incoming students would be paired based on shared interests (clubs/subjects) and availability. The first month would include a weekly 10–15 minute check-in (in person or supervised setting), plus one optional group meet-up focused on navigating school routines and exploring clubs. We would provide mentors with a simple checklist of topics (schedule, support resources, joining activities) to keep support consistent.
