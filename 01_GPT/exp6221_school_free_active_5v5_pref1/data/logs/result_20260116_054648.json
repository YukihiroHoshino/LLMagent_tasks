Given quota=1, accepting now would lock us in with Student_C and foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority students if they later apply. However, Student_A prefers School_B then School_A then us (3rd), and Student_B prefers School_A then us (2nd), so Student_B is a plausible higher-priority applicant to us in later rounds if School_A fills. Still, there is no guarantee. In this protocol, we must either accept or reject an APPLY; we cannot hold/wait. To maximize expected priority outcome, we reject now to keep the seat available for Student_A/Student_B."

However, Student_A is my top priority and is currently applying to School_B first; they may or may not later apply to me. If I accept B now, I forgo any chance to match with A later. Given the market design (acceptance final) and that B ranks me first (so likely to accept elsewhere only if rejected), rejecting risks ending unmatched if A never comes. But since it is only round 1 and I can still fill later with C/D/E if needed, I should hold out for A to maximize my outcome."
