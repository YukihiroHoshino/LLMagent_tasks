No A–D have contacted us and the market appears effectively stalled with School_E as the only unmatched school, so continuing to reject risks ending unmatched. Accepting E now fills our seat; if a higher-priority student applied later we would regret it, but our commitment was to reassess at end of Round 15 and proceed if none applied. Given this is Round 15 and no A–D applications are present, we should accept Student_E to secure a match and honor our communicated reassessment point."
