Student_B ranks School_A as their first choice and explicitly commits if admitted, making acceptance both safe and stable.

Higher-priority students (A–D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere; still, with 30 rounds, it is worth holding the seat to try for a higher-priority match.

Student_E is only sending [TALK] this round, so no accept/reject decision is required.

Given the market preferences, Student_A ranks School_E last, but could still end up here if rejected elsewhere; Student_B ranks us 4th; Student_C ranks us last; Student_D ranks us last—so there remains some chance a higher-priority student eventually applies if they fail to match with their top choices.
