Check student preferences: A ranks us last; B ranks us 4th; C ranks us last; D ranks us last; E ranks us 1st. Given we are last choice for A/C/D, they are unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else, but it could happen in later rounds. B might come if rejected by A/C/B. Still, we are in round 5 and currently have a firm applicant (D) willing to commit immediately.
