Given the common priority order across schools, higher-ranked students (A–D) may still apply later if they are rejected by their top choices. Accepting Student_E now would lock my only seat and prevent me from matching with any higher-priority student. Since I prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking a lower-priority student when higher-priority outcomes remain possible, I should reject Student_E again."
