Since we can only respond once and an [ACCEPT] would finalize the match immediately, accepting Student_B now would foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority Student_A. With no other applicants in the inbox this round, the optimal move to maximize our true priority match is to reject now and keep the seat open for a potential higher-priority applicant in subsequent rounds."

Waiting could potentially yield Student_A (#1), but Student_A’s preferences are B > A > C, so they are unlikely to apply to us unless rejected by B and A; with only 30 rounds and uncertainty, accepting Student_B secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched or with a lower-priority student.

Per our stated policy, we are now entering reassessment, and given that we have had no [TALK] or [APPLY] from Students A–D through Round 15, we are prepared to move forward.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_A. We appreciate your continued interest and your commitment to enroll.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_A Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and remain unmatched at Round 15. Our true priority list ranks A–D above E, but none of A–D have contacted us by the reassessment trigger we stated (Round 15 with no engagement). Student_E is on our acceptable list and has repeatedly affirmed immediate commitment. Holding longer risks ending unmatched with no benefit, while accepting E secures a fill now. Therefore accept Student_E."
