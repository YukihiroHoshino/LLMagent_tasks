Student_E has applied twice and was rejected because E is lowest priority; keeping the seat open for higher-priority students (A/B/C) is valuable. Check likelihood of higher-priority students approaching School_E: Student_A ranks School_E last; Student_B ranks School_E 4th; Student_C ranks School_E last. So only Student_B is a plausible higher-priority candidate who might come later if rejected elsewhere. However, we are already in round 4, and there is no indication Student_B is currently targeting School_E. Accepting Student_D now secures a match with a mid-ranked acceptable student rather than risking ending unmatched while waiting for a low-probability Student_B approach. Therefore accept Student_D."

Since there is no deadline pressure stated and rounds remain, the optimal strategy to maximize my match on the true priority list is to reject Student_E at this time and keep capacity open."

Only Student_E is currently applying, but accepting E now would lock the seat and prevent matching with any of A/B/C should they apply later. Given all schools share the same priority order, Student_A is top everywhere and may be matched quickly, but there is still a chance A/B/C could reach out to School_D in later rounds (e.g., if rejected elsewhere). Since School_D prefers higher-ranked students and can wait up to round 30, it is strategically better to keep the seat open rather than accept the lowest-ranked acceptable candidate at round 5. History: School_D already rejected Student_E once and has no new information changing priority. Therefore reject again to preserve option value for higher-priority students."
