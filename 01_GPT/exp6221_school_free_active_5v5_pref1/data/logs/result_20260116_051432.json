Our true priority ranks Student_E last, and higher-priority students (A-D) could still apply in later rounds since School_E is generally low on their preference lists but not impossible if they are rejected elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now would block us from matching with any higher-priority student later, which is against our objective. No other applicants are in the inbox this round, but we should continue to hold the seat given the early round (5/30) and the possibility of higher-priority applicants emerging. Therefore reject Student_E again while encouraging them to keep monitoring and reapply later if still unmatched."

However, we are still holding that seat for the possibility that higher-priority students (per our published priority order) may approach School_E in upcoming rounds—sometimes this happens later if they do not secure a place at schools they ranked above us.\n\nBecause we do not have visibility into other schools’ negotiations in real time, we can’t confirm whether higher-priority students have been “active” with us elsewhere or promise that the risk is decreasing in a specific round. What I can say is: if we reach a point where it appears no higher-priority students remain in play for our seat and we are still unfilled, we will be able to reconsider you.\n\nIf you remain unmatched in later rounds, you are welcome to send another [APPLY]. At that time we will reassess based on who is still unmatched and whether any higher-priority applicants are still a realistic possibility for our remaining capacity.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_E Admissions",
              "thought": "We have 1 seat and our true priority is A > B > C > D > E. Student_E is lowest on our list. Student_E is repeatedly applying/talking, but accepting now would forgo the possibility of matching with any higher-priority student if they later apply. Given other students’ preferences, A ranks School_E last, B ranks it 4th, C ranks it last, D ranks it last—so the chance of higher-priority applicants coming to us is low but not zero, especially if they are rejected elsewhere in later rounds. With no evidence that A-D are matched yet, it is still rational to hold the seat. Student_E sent [TALK], so respond with [TALK], provide general info without committing, and invite them to apply again later if still open."

Holding the seat longer risks ending unmatched, which is worse than filling with an acceptable student on our list. Student_E is on our list and is committed, so accepting now secures a match and avoids vacancy risk."
