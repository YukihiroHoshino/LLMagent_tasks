In a student-proposing process, Student_A will likely be accepted by School_B (their first choice) and not reach me; Student_B will likely be accepted by School_A (their first choice) and not reach me; Student_C will likely be accepted by School_C (their first choice) and not reach me. That makes the probability of receiving a higher-priority applicant later low. Student_E ranks School_D last and is unlikely to apply.

No higher-priority students (A–D) have applied through Round 7, and Student_E followed our instruction to re-apply in Round 8 with a credible commitment to accept immediately. Given the long wait already and the risk of ending unmatched if we continue holding out, accepting Student_E now secures a match. Since our priorities are identical across schools and Student_E ranks us first, this is stable for us and prevents losing them to another school later."
