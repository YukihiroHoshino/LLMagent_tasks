Student_A prefers School_B first, Student_B prefers School_A first, and Student_C prefers School_C first, so School_D is relatively unlikely to be targeted in round 1 by those higher-priority students.

Given the market, higher-priority students (A/B/C) all rank School_D as 4th choice and are likely to apply elsewhere first, so waiting risks ending unmatched. With quota 1 and a credible immediate-commit application in hand, accepting Student_D maximizes certainty while still staying within the acceptable priority list."
