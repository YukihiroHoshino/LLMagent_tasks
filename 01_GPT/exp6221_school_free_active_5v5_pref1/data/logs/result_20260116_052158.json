Given all schools share identical priorities, Student_A and Student_B are highly sought and may still be negotiating with their top choices; however, they could later turn to School_C (Student_B ranks School_C 2nd; Student_A ranks it 3rd). With round 12 and still no higher-priority applicant in our inbox, the temptation is to accept C to secure a match, but our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and we are permitted to remain unfilled. Therefore, continue to hold the seat and reject Student_C this round while answering the yes/no question: we have not received any communication of intent from higher-priority students."

However, we have repeatedly held the seat through round 13 with no higher-priority applications or signals of intent. Student_C is our #3 and highly committed; continuing to hold indefinitely risks ending unmatched by round 30. With 17 rounds remaining, the optimal strategy is still to hold a bit longer for A/B, but we can credibly commit to a conditional next-round offer to keep C engaged while preserving the option if A/B appear this round.
