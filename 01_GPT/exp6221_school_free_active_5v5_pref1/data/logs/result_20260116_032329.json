Given full market info: Student_A ranks School_E last; Student_B ranks E 4th; Student_C ranks E last; Student_D ranks E last; Student_E ranks E 1st. Other schools share the same priority ordering, so higher-ranked students (A/B) are likely to be absorbed by their higher-preference schools, but there remains a possibility—especially if instability/late movement occurs—that a higher-ranked student could become available to me later. Since Student_E is only [TALK] this round (not an [APPLY]), I should not lock in; I should keep them warm while preserving flexibility to accept a higher-ranked student if they approach. Continue with [TALK], reiterate no change in capacity, and confirm what identifiers are needed; avoid promising anything."
