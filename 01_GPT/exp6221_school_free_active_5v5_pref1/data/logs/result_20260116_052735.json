With quota 1 and no other current applicants, accepting Student_C now secures a solid match with a student who strongly prefers us, avoiding the risk of ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply."

Only Student_D has School_D as first choice, but A/B/C all rank School_D as 4th choice, making it plausible they may not reach us unless rejected elsewhere.

Since all schools share the same priority ordering and students generally prefer other schools over School_E (A-D list us last; B lists us 4th; C last; D last), it is likely that higher-priority students (especially Student_A or Student_B) will be unmatched with their top choices and may later apply to School_E as a fallback.
