Given the market, Student_A’s top choice is School_B (School_C is 3rd) and Student_B’s top choice is School_A (School_C is 2nd), so there is a meaningful chance neither applies to School_C in round 1, but they could apply later if rejected elsewhere. With only one seat, accepting Student_C now risks missing a higher-priority Student_A or Student_B if they become available in subsequent rounds. Since it is only round 1 and no other applicants are currently in our inbox, the optimal strategy to maximize priority is to reject now and preserve capacity for higher-ranked candidates who may apply later."

Given all schools share the same priority order and Student_A is universally top, A is likely to be accepted by their top choice (School_B) and may never reach me; similarly B and C have higher-ranked options and may not apply here.

              "thought": "School_C’s true priority ranks Student_A highest, then Student_B, then Student_C. However, in round 29 there are no other applicants in the inbox, and only one round remains after this. Given the long history of rejections, holding the seat further risks ending unmatched, which is strictly worse than matching with an acceptable student on our list. Student_C is on our priority list and has credibly committed to enroll. With quota 1 and no competing candidates this round, accept to secure a match rather than risk an empty seat at the end of the simulation."
