All schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), so I am 4th everywhere; delaying risks losing School_D to Students A/B/C if they apply there.

              "thought": "Student_D applied this round and we have quota 1. Our true priority ranks Student_D 4th (behind A, B, C). However, Student_D lists School_D as their first choice, making acceptance highly likely to lock in a match immediately. Waiting for higher-ranked students is risky because Student_A ranks us 4th, Student_B ranks us last, and Student_C ranks us 4th; they are likely to apply elsewhere first and may never reach us within the limited rounds. With only one applicant now and strong commitment signal, accepting Student_D maximizes certainty of filling our seat with an acceptable student rather than risking ending unmatched."

              "thought": "Apply to my top choice (School_E) immediately. With identical school priorities (A>B>C>D>E) and one seat each, I have lowest priority everywhere, so I likely won’t win contested schools. Still, I should shoot for my true top first in case others don’t apply there in round 1; if rejected, I can pivot quickly to other options next rounds."

              "thought": "Student_E is applying now and is my lowest-ranked option on my true priority list. Given the market, higher-ranked students (A-D) all rank School_E last, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. With only one round so far and no other applicants in my inbox, I could wait to see if any higher-ranked student applies in later rounds, but that risks ending unmatched if they never come. Since Student_E ranks us first and is offering a sure match within my acceptable set, accepting secures a filled seat and avoids the downside risk of holding out for unlikely applicants."

Given the market, Student_A prefers School_B then School_A, and Student_B prefers School_A then School_C; both might become available to School_C later if rejected elsewhere.

Our true priority ranks Student_A above Student_B, but Student_A has School_B as first choice and may not apply to us in early rounds; Student_B explicitly states School_A is their first choice and has applied now. Accepting Student_B secures a high-ranked candidate immediately and avoids the risk of remaining unfilled if Student_A never applies. Since all schools share the same priority order, Student_A will likely be absorbed by their top choice if they apply there, further reducing our chance to land Student_A. Therefore, accept Student_B now."

However, in this round my inbox only contains Student_C, and I currently have no match. Waiting for Student_A or Student_B could improve my outcome, but there is no guarantee they will ever apply to School_C (their preferences place School_C 3rd and 2nd respectively), and rejecting again risks ending unmatched or being forced later to accept an even lower-priority student. Given Student_C ranks School_C first and will immediately accept, accepting now secures a reasonably high-ranked student (3rd) within my quota and avoids vacancy risk."
