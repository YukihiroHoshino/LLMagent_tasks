Our true priority ranks Student_A and Student_B above Student_C, so in principle we would like to hold the seat for a higher-ranked applicant if we expect them to apply soon. However, in Round 1 we have only received an application from Student_C. Student_A’s top choice is School_B (we are 3rd), Student_B’s top choice is School_A (we are 2nd), Student_D’s top is School_D (we are 3rd), Student_E’s top is School_E (we are 4th). This makes it uncertain that a higher-priority student will apply to School_C, and accepting Student_C now secures a solid match within quota rather than risking ending unmatched. Therefore, accept Student_C."

With identical priority orders at every school (A highest, E lowest), I have the weakest priority and will likely be rejected at popular schools if higher-priority students apply.

However, School_E's true priority ranks Student_E last (A>B>C>D>E). Given all schools share the same priority order and most students rank School_E last, higher-priority students (A-D) are very unlikely to apply to School_E early, but could apply later if rejected elsewhere. With only one seat, holding out could in theory yield a higher-priority student, but the probability seems low; still, accepting now locks in the lowest-ranked acceptable student. Since Student_E is on the acceptable list and offers to commit, and there is no other applicant this round, accept to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."
