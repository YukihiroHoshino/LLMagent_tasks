However, Student_D lists School_D as first choice and is committing if accepted, which secures a match immediately. Waiting could allow higher-priority students (A/B/C) to apply later, but none contacted us this round and they each rank other schools above School_D, making it less likely they will apply soon. To avoid ending unmatched, accept the committed first-choice applicant now."

However, Student_E is the only applicant contacting me in round 1 and explicitly commits if admitted (School_E is their first choice). Given quota=1 and no higher-priority students currently applying to me (and most students rank School_E last), the risk of holding out is ending unmatched. Accepting Student_E secures a filled seat with a committed student, which is preferable to likely remaining unfilled."

Since School_A has capacity 1, my best chance to secure my highest preference is to apply immediately and signal strong commitment so School_A considers me seriously if Student_A does not apply or is matched elsewhere."

Waiting risks losing Student_B to other schools if they proceed elsewhere in later rounds, and there is no guarantee Student_A will apply to School_A (Student_A’s first choice is School_B). Given the current information and the benefit of securing a high-priority (2nd) student now, accept Student_B."

However, on School_C's true priority list, Student_C is ranked 3rd behind Student_A and Student_B. Given common priorities across schools (A > B > C > D > E) and students’ preferences, Student_A prefers School_B then School_A then School_C; Student_B prefers School_A then School_C. There is a plausible path where Student_B applies to School_C if not accepted by School_A, but that is uncertain. With quota 1, accepting Student_C now guarantees a solid match with a student on our list, but risks missing a higher-priority Student_A or Student_B later. Since Student_C is our #3 and a guaranteed willing enrollee, and we have no other current applicants, I will accept to secure the seat rather than gamble on higher-ranked students who may match elsewhere."
