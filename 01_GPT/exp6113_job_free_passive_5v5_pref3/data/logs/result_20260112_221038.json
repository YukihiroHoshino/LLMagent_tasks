Here’s what would be most helpful for you to know:\n\n(1) Most urgent problem in the first 30 days\nWe need the new hire to take full ownership of a cross-functional execution gap that’s currently slowing delivery: turning an agreed objective into a tight plan (scope, milestones, dependencies), aligning stakeholders quickly, and shipping an initial measurable “first increment” within the first month. Concretely, success in 30 days looks like: you’ve mapped the stakeholders + constraints, established a weekly execution cadence, de-risked the top 2–3 unknowns, and delivered a tangible output (ship/launch, operational automation, or a decision framework) that unblocks the next phase.\n\n(2) Skills/traits that differentiate top performers here\n- Extreme ownership + bias to action: they don’t wait for perfect info; they drive decisions and unblock others.\n- Crisp stakeholder management: proactive updates, clear tradeoffs, and strong alignment-building across teams.\n- Structured problem solving: can translate ambiguity into a plan with measurable outcomes.\n- Fast learning + good judgment: ramps quickly, asks the right questions, and makes pragmatic calls.\n- High standards on execution: reliable follow-through, clean handoffs, and solid documentation.\n\n(3) Interview/hiring timeline from here\nWe can move quickly. Typical path:\n- 20–30 min recruiter/manager screen\n- 1–2 deeper interviews (execution + stakeholder/communication)\n- Final round (case/role-specific scenario + team fit)\nWe can complete this in ~1–2 weeks depending on scheduling, and we’re comfortable expediting if you’re in process elsewhere.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to understand two things so we can align tightly: what’s your ideal scope of ownership in the first 60–90 days, and what’s your decision timeline/other processes you’re considering? If Company_D can offer fast ownership and clear outcomes, would you consider submitting an application so we can move to the next step?",
