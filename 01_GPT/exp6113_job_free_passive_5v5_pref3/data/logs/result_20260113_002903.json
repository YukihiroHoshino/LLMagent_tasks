We’d be excited to move forward—please share 1–2 concrete examples of projects you drove end-to-end under tight timelines (scope, stakeholders, what you shipped, and the measurable outcome). We’ll use that to align you quickly to our highest-priority work in your first 30–60 days. [ACCEPT]",

However, we have no guarantee C will apply/accept Company_E since Company_E is last on C’s preference list. If we reject B now, we risk ending unmatched. Given quota=1 and round=3, accepting a solid in-list candidate is prudent to secure a match."
