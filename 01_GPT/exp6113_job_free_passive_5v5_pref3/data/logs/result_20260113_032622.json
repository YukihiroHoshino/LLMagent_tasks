Typically: 1) a 20–30 min recruiter/manager screen, 2) a focused technical/role interview loop, 3) final decision within a few days after the loop (often 48–72 hours).\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of role are you targeting (scope, domain), and what’s the most important factor for you in choosing a company?
