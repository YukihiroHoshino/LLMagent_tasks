Do quick system/domain mapping, identify root causes, write a short plan with tradeoffs.\n- **Weeks 3–6:** **Ship an MVP improvement** (instrumentation + first fix/feature) and get it into users’ hands or into production ops.\n- **Weeks 6–8:** Iterate based on data/feedback, harden reliability (tests/alerts/runbooks), and hand off clear docs so the gains stick.\n\nIf helpful, we can share a couple real examples from recent hires (performance/reliability vs. workflow automation vs. product surface area) and pick the closest match to your strengths.\n\n**(2) Background/strengths we’re specifically hoping for**\nWe’re optimizing for **execution + ownership in ambiguous, cross-functional work** more than narrow domain tenure.
