We have quota 1 and other remaining seekers include Seeker_A (#1 for us) and Seeker_E (#4). Since Seeker_A prefers us last as well and may not apply, securing Seeker_C is valuable. Provide clear priorities, “easy yes” criteria, and signal we are open but moving quickly; invite them to apply this round."

Company_D ranks me 2/5, which is relatively strong, and Company_D is still unmatched this round, so applying now could lock in a decent outcome versus risking ending up with Company_E or unemployed if the market closes.
