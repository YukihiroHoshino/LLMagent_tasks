You can absolutely contribute quickly here, and we’re moving fast.\n\nTop 1–2 priorities for the first 60–90 days:\n1) Own and ship an end-to-end product/workflow improvement: align scope with PM/design, implement, launch, and measure adoption/impact.\n2) Reduce operational drag in a recurring area: tighten metrics/alerts, improve reliability/performance, and establish a clear ownership/on-call loop (so issues are caught early and resolved cleanly).\n\nDecision timeline:\n- Once you apply, we aim to schedule an initial screen within ~1 week, then run a focused loop shortly after. We’re prepared to make a decision quickly for the right fit.\n\nIf you share a concise plan for how you’d deliver in the first 60–90 days (what you’d do in weeks 1–2, what you’d ship by week 4–6, and how you’d measure impact), plus 2–3 time windows over the next 7–10 days, I’ll prioritize getting you into next steps. If you’re ready, I’d encourage you to submit the formal application immediately so we can move fast.",

Seeker_C ranks Company_E last, so we must persuade and move them to apply quickly. We cannot accept without an [APPLY] tag. Provide clear 60–90 day priorities and a fast decision timeline, then ask for their concise plan and availability, encouraging immediate application to secure the slot."

I can contribute quickly with reliable execution, clear stakeholder coordination, and delivering outcomes under ambiguity. If helpful, I can share a concise 60–90 day plan aligned to your top priorities. I’m ready to proceed whenever you are.",

Company_E is on my preference list (lowest), and I have only TALKed so far—no formal application.

If you can, please send:\n1) 2–3 time windows over the next 7–10 days, and\n2) a concise 60–90 day plan (bullet points are perfect: weeks 1–2, by weeks 4–6, and how you’ll measure impact).\n\nWe’re excited to proceed.",
