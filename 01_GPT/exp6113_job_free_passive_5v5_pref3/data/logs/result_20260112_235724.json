Company_B’s priority list ranks me #2 (after Seeker_D), which gives me a strong acceptance chance if I apply now. Seeker_D is highly prioritized by multiple firms and may take B if they approach; securing B now is a reasonable compromise while still acceptable to me."

Accepting secures a strong candidate aligned to our priorities and avoids ending unmatched if Seeker_D never comes to us. Therefore accept and move fast to lock in."
