Company_C’s priority ranks me 4th (behind Seeker_C, Seeker_B, Seeker_D), but those seekers are likely matched elsewhere by now; if any are still available, I need to differentiate with immediate commitment and fit. Best move: [TALK] with a concise, high-commitment pitch, offer to answer any final questions, and explicitly ask if they can extend an offer this round."
