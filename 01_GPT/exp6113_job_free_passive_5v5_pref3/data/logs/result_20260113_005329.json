              "thought": "Seeker_E is on our true priority list (4th of 5). Only Seeker_A and Seeker_E remain unmatched; Seeker_A is our top choice but they rank us last, so probability of landing Seeker_A is low. With quota 1, accepting Seeker_E secures a preferred (listed) candidate and avoids risk of ending unmatched. Therefore accept and reinforce fit with clear early outcomes and decision criteria."
