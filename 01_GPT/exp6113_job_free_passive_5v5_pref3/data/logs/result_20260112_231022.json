Here’s a clear view of what success looks like:\n\n1) Top priorities in the first 60–90 days\n- By ~30 days: deliver a measurable “quick win” (e.g., remove a recurring bottleneck, improve a key workflow, or lift a metric via a targeted change) while building trust with core stakeholders.\n- By ~60–90 days: own and ship an end-to-end initiative with clear success metrics—problem framing, stakeholder alignment, execution, and crisp written updates—ideally something cross-functional that has visible impact.\n\n2) Day-to-day ownership\nYou’d be the DRI on 1–2 active workstreams at a time. Day-to-day is a mix of: (a) independent problem-solving and drafting a plan/decision docs, (b) stakeholder syncs to unblock decisions, and (c) execution tracking against milestones/metrics. We keep collaboration high but ownership very explicit.\n\n3) Profiles that succeed here\nPeople who (a) take initiative in ambiguity, (b) communicate clearly and proactively (especially in writing), (c) are analytically grounded and metric-oriented, and (d) are low-ego and dependable—strong follow-through matters a lot.\n\nIf you’re open to moving fast, two quick questions to confirm fit: \n- What type of problems/role scope are you prioritizing right now (0→1 building, scaling/optimization, stakeholder-heavy ops, etc.)?\n- Share one example where you delivered a concrete result in your first ~60 days on a new team.\n\nIf those align, I’d encourage you to apply this round and we can proceed immediately.",
