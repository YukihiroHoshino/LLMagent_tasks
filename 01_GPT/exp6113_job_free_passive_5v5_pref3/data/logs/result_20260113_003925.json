In practical terms, that means:\n- Diagnose the bottleneck end-to-end (data + stakeholder interviews) within ~2 weeks\n- Propose a scoped plan with clear success metrics and owners\n- Ship at least one meaningful change within 30–60 days (process + tooling/automation + handoffs), and stand up a lightweight dashboard so we can track impact weekly\n\n2) What makes someone a clear “yes”\n- You can turn ambiguity into a crisp plan fast (problem statement → options → decision → execution)\n- You demonstrate strong prioritization and stakeholder management (you can align people who don’t naturally align)\n- You have a track record of shipping measurable outcomes (even if the metric varies—cycle time, quality, conversion, cost, reliability)\n- Communication is tight: clear updates, risks surfaced early, decisions documented\n\n3) Decision timeline from here\nWe can move quickly. If you’re still interested, our ideal path is:\n- You share a brief outline of how you’d approach the first project (even 6–10 bullets is great)\n- Then we schedule a focused conversation to pressure-test it (and discuss scope/expectations)\n- We aim to make a decision within ~7–10 days from receiving your outline, faster if calendars allow\n\nAnd yes—please send that brief approach outline.
