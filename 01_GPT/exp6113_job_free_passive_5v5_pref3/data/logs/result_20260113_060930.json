I already applied to D earlier; D’s priority ranks me last, so my acceptance odds there are low. Company_B’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Seeker_D), so I have a decent chance if I apply now, especially since other seekers (notably Seeker_B) rank B as their top choice and may compete. To avoid ending up with only E or unemployment, it’s strategically sound to apply to B this round and signal commitment/value while keeping it concise."
