Your focus on reliable execution under deadlines and cross-stakeholder coordination is exactly what we value. We’d be happy to move forward and confirm the match. If you can, please share one example of a deadline-driven project you led (scope, stakeholders, what you delivered, and the outcome) so we can align you with the right team once onboard.",

Although Seeker_D and Seeker_E are higher on our list, we have no guarantee we will meet them soon, and they do not rank Company_D first (Seeker_D ranks us last; Seeker_E ranks us 4th). Accepting Seeker_C now is a good outcome within quota 1 and reduces risk of ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked candidate."
