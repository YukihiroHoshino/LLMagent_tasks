Given Company_E ranks Seeker_A first, an [APPLY] is likely to be accepted and would secure a match, but it would foreclose chances at higher-ranked Company_D (3rd) or Company_B (4th). Since I still have acceptable higher options remaining and no evidence they are unattainable yet, I should first [TALK] with Company_E to keep the option warm while I potentially pursue D/B in subsequent rounds. One-message exchange per round suggests I should also lightly signal strong fit to encourage them to hold capacity for me without formally applying."
