Those seekers’ top choices are Company_C (both D and E), so they may not target Company_D first; however, if they get rejected or Company_C fills, they could pivot to Company_D. Since Company_D is still unmatched in round 3, applying immediately maximizes my chance to secure my top outcome before competition shifts. Even if I’m not their top priority, an early, clear commitment can help if higher-priority seekers don’t apply or accept elsewhere."

If you think there’s a realistic path to an offer in the next round, I can prioritize you and move fast.",
