Here’s what we’re optimizing for:\n\n1) **Top 2–3 capabilities**\n- **End-to-end execution in ambiguity:** scoping → plan → delivery → rollout, with clear milestones and risk management.\n- **Metrics/measurement rigor:** defining success metrics, establishing baselines, and instrumenting dashboards/alerts so outcomes are provable.\n- **Stakeholder alignment with low overhead:** crisp written updates, expectation-setting, and unblocking across 1–2 partner teams.\n\n2) **Success in the first 60–90 days**\n- **By ~60 days:** you’ve identified the highest-leverage workflow bottleneck, shipped an initial improvement, and stood up/standardized the core KPI definitions + instrumentation so we trust the numbers.\n- **By ~90 days:** the workflow improvement is broadly rolled out with clear before/after impact (cycle time, failure rate, or reliability), and the measurement layer is being used in a regular operating cadence (dashboards + alerts + review).\n\n3) **Decision timeline**\nWe’re aiming to fill this single opening **quickly—over the next ~1–2 rounds** of conversations (i.e., very soon). If there’s strong mutual fit, we can move fast.\n\nIf you’re ready to map your experience: can you share 1–2 examples with (a) baseline metric, (b) what you changed, and (c) quantified outcome? Also, what’s your timeline/other processes so we can coordinate. If it lines up, you can submit a formal application immediately and we’ll prioritize review.\n\n[TALK]",

Here’s the clearest view I can give you:\n\n1) Offer decision timeline\nIf you apply right away and we can schedule quickly, we can typically complete the process in ~7–10 days end-to-end (sometimes faster). After the final interview, we aim to make a decision within ~3–5 business days.\n\n2) Top must-have skills/experiences (1–2)\n- Demonstrated end-to-end ownership of a meaningful project/workstream (from ambiguous problem → plan → execution → measurable outcome).\n- Strong cross-functional stakeholder management and communication (driving alignment, decisions, and a steady operating cadence).\n\n3) Potential gaps / fit risks (based on what I know so far)\nI don’t have enough detail on your background from our chat to flag specific gaps yet. The main things that could be blockers are: (a) limited examples of owning outcomes (not just contributing), (b) minimal experience influencing across teams without direct authority, or (c) not being comfortable using metrics to run/iterate on the work.\n\nIf you want, send 2–3 bullets on (i) your most relevant project (scope, your role, measurable result), (ii) the cross-functional partners involved, and (iii) your earliest start date.
