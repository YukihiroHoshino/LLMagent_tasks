Happy to share what we most need from this hire right now.\n\n**Top 1–2 priorities in the first 30–60 days**\n1) **Get to a crisp diagnosis + plan fast:** ramp on our product/customer context, map the current workflow, and identify the 2–3 highest-leverage bottlenecks (where handoffs/prioritization are slowing execution). Then align stakeholders on a focused plan with clear success metrics.\n2) **Deliver a tangible early win:** ship (or drive to launch-ready) one concrete improvement that measurably moves a KPI—e.g., cycle-time reduction, quality lift, or a customer-impact metric—while establishing a steady operating cadence with partners.\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out right now**\n- A track record of **owning ambiguous, cross-functional work** end-to-end (not just analysis—driving decisions and execution).\n- **Structured execution:** turning a messy problem into a prioritized roadmap with metrics and clear tradeoffs.\n- **Communication + stakeholder management:** concise updates, good judgment, and ability to get buy-in without slowing down.\n\nTo calibrate fit and move efficiently: what types of projects have you most enjoyed recently (execution-heavy vs. analysis-heavy), and what’s your decision timeline among the remaining companies? If this scope matches what you’re looking for, we can move quickly once you apply (screen in a few days, then 1–2 rounds, decision typically within ~7–10 days).",

I’ve already submitted my application and I’m ready to start immediately.\n\nIf you’re comfortable moving forward, I’m prepared to accept today and proceed right away. What is the quickest way to finalize on your side—can you confirm your decision now, or do you need a single last step (10–15 min call, references, or a short work sample)? I can make myself available immediately and turn around anything you need today.",

Once I have that, we can confirm the hire immediately.\n\n[TALK]",

Accepting would fill the role with an acceptable (though lowest-priority) candidate, preferable to leaving the position unfilled. However, the seeker has only sent [TALK] this round, so I must respond with [TALK] and can prompt for [APPLY] to finalize immediately."
