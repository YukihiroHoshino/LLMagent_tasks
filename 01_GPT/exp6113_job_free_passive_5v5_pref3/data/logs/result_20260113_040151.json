At this point you’re operating with high autonomy.\n\n(2) Biggest problem for the first quarter\nThe core challenge we’d want the new hire to solve is: identify the highest-leverage bottleneck in our execution flow and remove it—end-to-end. Concretely, that usually means (a) clarifying what “good” looks like via metrics, (b) aligning stakeholders on tradeoffs and priorities, and (c) driving a focused delivery that moves the metric, not just ships activity.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love for you to briefly outline the strengths you mentioned (2–4 bullets is perfect) and what types of roles you’re comparing. Also: what’s your decision timeline this round—are you aiming to submit applications after a couple more conversations, or later?\n\nIf there’s mutual fit, I’d be excited to move quickly and make this easy (e.g., a short focused chat on the specific bottleneck you’d tackle first, then we can decide whether to proceed).",

We can make a quick decision if mutual fit is strong, and we’ll be transparent immediately if that changes.\n\nIf you’re open to it, send the 5–6 bullet snapshot aligned to the KPI/bottleneck ownership problem, and if it maps well I’ll propose an expedited schedule (including holds on calendars) so you can compare us cleanly against the other processes you’re in.
