After an initial conversation, we aim to complete the process within ~1–2 weeks (often faster if schedules align), and we’ll communicate next steps within a couple business days after each stage.\n\nIf you’re open to it, what are your top 2 criteria in your search (e.g., scope/ownership, tech stack or domain, team size, growth, location/remote, compensation), and what kind of role are you targeting?

With quota=1 and remaining seekers B,C,E, my top remaining choice would be Seeker_E (#2) but they have not applied; Seeker_C is applying now and ranks Company_D as their #1, making acceptance likely to secure a strong match immediately. Risk of waiting: Seeker_E may match with Company_C (their #1) or Company_B (their #2) and never apply; Seeker_B prefers Company_B first and may not be attainable. Accept Seeker_C to lock in a high-quality, high-likelihood match rather than gamble for Seeker_E."
