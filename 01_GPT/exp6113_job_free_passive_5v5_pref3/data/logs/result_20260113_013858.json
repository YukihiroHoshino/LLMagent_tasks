If there’s mutual interest, the next step is: **you apply this round**, and we’ll prioritize a fast process (quick screen → deeper discussion → final decision) with tight turnaround.\n\nIf you’re open to it, reply with (a) what you’re optimizing for in your next role (scope/mentorship/pace), and (b) one example of something you owned end-to-end with a measurable outcome—then I can tell you directly how well it maps and we can move quickly.",
