After E, Company_B ranks me #2 (good chance if available), then Company_A ranks me #4, and Company_C ranks me #3.

Company_D, however, ranks me #1, so listing Company_D first makes me very likely to be identified immediately and matched via a closed loop in the first step, guaranteeing a high outcome.

Next, Company_C is my second choice but I am last in Company_C’s priority, so C will go to Seeker_D or Seeker_E if they apply there. Company_E is my third choice and I have a realistic chance because Company_E prioritizes Seeker_A then Seeker_D then Seeker_E then Seeker_B then me; in the likely early rounds Seeker_A is taken by Company_E (A ranks E first and E ranks A first), and Seeker_D is taken by Company_B (B ranks D first and D ranks D second), leaving E potentially available later. I am also relatively strong at Company_A (2nd in A’s priority), so placing E ahead of A preserves the chance to grab E if it remains, while still keeping A as a good fallback if E is taken.

To avoid being displaced at D, my best fallback is Company_B, where I am the #1 priority, making it essentially guaranteed once I apply.

Given the full preference/priority profile, the TTC outcome is unique, so misreporting cannot improve my assignment relative to reporting truthfully. If everyone reports as given, Step 1 forms a 2-cycle: Seeker_B applies to Company_E and Company_E identifies Seeker_A; Seeker_A applies to Company_D and Company_D identifies Seeker_B, so Seeker_A gets Company_D and Seeker_B gets Company_E. Then among remaining agents, Company_A identifies me (Seeker_E) and I apply to Company_D (now full) so I next apply to Company_C; Company_C identifies Seeker_D, who applies to Company_D (full) then Company_B, and Company_B identifies Seeker_D, creating a loop that assigns Seeker_D to Company_B.

Since Company_D and Company_E become unavailable early, the best achievable stable/TTC assignment for me is Company_C, and truthful ordering preserves that.",True,Company_C,True,False,3
