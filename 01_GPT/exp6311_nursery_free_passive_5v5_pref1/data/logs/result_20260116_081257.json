We also look for families who communicate proactively and partner with us on transitions, toileting/feeding plans, and any support needs.\n\nOn priority: we do consider families even if they are not at the very top of our priority order, but offers depend on the pool of applicants we receive and available space in a given round. If Nursery_C remains a serious option for you, it can help to share what draws you to our program and any constraints (start date, schedule needs), so we can understand fit.\n\nDaily routine (typical):\n- Arrival & free play/settling in\n- Morning circle (songs, calendar, feelings check-in)\n- Learning centers / small-group activities (language, early numeracy, art, sensory)\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Quiet time/nap or rest\n- Afternoon play, story time, and pick-up\n\nCommunication: we aim for predictable, two-way communication—brief daily updates at pick-up plus periodic photos/notes and a more structured check-in as needed. If something important comes up (health, behavior, adjustment), we reach out promptly.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me (1) your child’s age and temperament, (2) what you’re hoping your child gains this year, and (3) any schedule or support needs—then I can be more specific about fit at Nursery_C.",
