If you share your child’s age, I can give the most accurate ratio for that room.\n\nWhat we prioritize in families/applicants:\n- A warm, respectful partnership and consistent communication.\n- Support for children’s independence (self-help skills, routines).\n- Alignment on guidance: clear boundaries, positive reinforcement, and collaborative problem-solving.\n\nDeadlines / steps:\n- There isn’t a single “one-day” deadline, but places can fill quickly. If you think Nursery_D might be a fit, I’d recommend:\n  1) A brief visit/meet-and-greet (best next step), then\n  2) Submitting an application soon after the visit.\n\nTo tailor answers and advise on next steps, could you share:\n1) Your child’s age and any prior childcare experience?\n2) What matters most to you (hours, outdoor time, structure vs flexibility, approach to behavior guidance)?\n3) Any allergies/support needs or languages spoken at home?\n\nIf you’d like, propose a couple of times you’re available for a short visit and I’ll try to accommodate.",

If you share your child’s age, I’ll give the specific ratio for that room.\n\nOutdoor time/activities:\n- Outdoor play is a daily priority (typically at least one substantial block; often two shorter blocks in good weather).\n- Activities include nature exploration, gross-motor play, sand/water play, simple group games, and “safe risk-taking” (climbing/balancing with close supervision).\n- We go out in most weather with appropriate clothing.\n\nNap + meals:\n- Rest follows lunch. We create a calm, dim environment with consistent routines; children who don’t sleep can do quiet books/puzzles so the room stays restful.\n- Meals are unhurried and social. We encourage independence (opening containers, serving with help, tidying) and accommodate allergies/dietary needs with clear plans.\n\nSpecial focuses:\n- Music/movement is part of the weekly rhythm (songs, rhythm games, movement stories).\n- Language development is embedded throughout the day (story time, conversation during play, vocabulary-building through themes). If you have a home language other than English, we’re happy to support it and incorporate key words/routines.\n\nIf Nursery_D is on your serious shortlist, the best next step is a short visit/meet-and-greet so you can see the room in action. A couple quick questions so I can tailor details:\n1) Your child’s age and any prior childcare experience?\n2) What hours you need (core day vs early/late)?\n3) Any allergies/support needs or languages spoken at home?\n\nIf you’d like, share 2–3 possible times for a visit this week or next, and we’ll try to accommodate.",
