We assign a consistent key educator, use predictable goodbye routines (short, confident, consistent), and offer a calming “anchor” (comfort item, photo, or a familiar book). We’ll communicate with you daily during the first weeks and adjust pace if needed.\n\n2) Naps and outdoor time: We follow an age-appropriate rest routine after lunch. Children who nap are supported with a consistent space and soothing routine; children who don’t sleep are offered quiet activities (books, puzzles) so they can still recharge without disrupting others. Outdoor play happens every day when weather permits—usually a longer block in the morning and/or afternoon. We’re flexible about layering/clothing and will work with you on any sensitivities.\n\n3) Key dates/steps to move forward quickly: If Nursery_B becomes your top choice, the fastest path is to submit an [APPLY] as soon as you’re ready. After an application, we confirm availability, share enrollment paperwork (basic child info, emergency contacts, health/immunization requirements), and schedule a short onboarding call plus a settling-in plan.\n\nIf you’re open to it, what’s your child’s age and current nap pattern (reliable nap / dropping naps / needs support)?

We can usually discuss:\n- A start window (e.g., starting at the beginning of a week, or a staged/gradual settling-in)\n- Part-time vs full-time options (and whether fixed days are needed)\nIf you tell me your ideal start date and the attendance pattern you’re considering (days per week and preferred days), I can confirm what we can accommodate.\n\nIf Nursery_D is moving into your top choices, you’re very welcome to submit an application—then we can move from “exploring” to actually holding a place and planning a smooth start.",
