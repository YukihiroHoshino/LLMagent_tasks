We balance structure with plenty of child-led exploration.\n\nApproach to early learning & play: Our focus is play-based learning with intentional adult support—language-rich interactions, hands-on materials (blocks, art, sensory play), and small-group activities that build early literacy/numeracy through games, storytelling, and everyday routines. We emphasize social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, naming feelings) and independence (self-help skills like tidying up, dressing, handwashing).\n\nSupporting transitions for new children: We use a gentle, individualized settling-in plan. Typically this includes a short initial visit with the parent, then gradually increasing time (depending on the child). We assign a consistent key educator to build trust, keep routines predictable, and use comfort strategies (a familiar item from home, visual cues, and clear goodbye rituals). We also provide frequent updates early on so you know how your child is adjusting.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and any needs/preferences (sleep routine, separation worries, allergies, language background), I can describe what settling-in would look like specifically for your family and answer any practical questions (hours, meals, outdoor time, communication).",

If you tell me your ideal drop-off and pick-up times (and whether you need occasional early/late days), I can confirm what we can support.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor this better:\n1) How old is your child, and have they been in a group setting before?\n2) What matters most for your family (outdoor time, gentle settling-in, early language, social-emotional focus, etc.)?\n\nIf Nursery_D feels like a strong fit after this, you’re very welcome to apply—happy to guide you through next steps.",

Nothing is “locked in” yet because we only confirm once we’ve received an application and reviewed fit against our priorities and start-date needs.\n\n(2) Decision timing: We expect to make a final decision as soon as we have a clear applicant we can confidently offer the place to—typically within the next couple of rounds rather than waiting until the very end.\n\n(3) What we prioritize for fit: With one spot, the practical factors matter a lot—start date alignment/urgency, the hours needed (and whether they match what we can accommodate), and how smoothly we anticipate the transition will be for the child (e.g., any key support needs we should plan for). Proximity can help with consistency, but it’s usually secondary to schedule/start-date fit.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: your child’s age, desired start date, and the hours/days you need, I can tell you candidly whether your request looks feasible on our side.

If we extend an offer, we typically ask families to confirm within a short window so we can plan staffing and transitions.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can be more specific about fit and timing:\n- What age is your child, and are you looking for a start date this term or later?\n- What matters most for your family (e.g., gentle settling-in, outdoor time, early language, longer hours)?\n\nI’m glad to answer anything else you’re weighing as you explore options.",
