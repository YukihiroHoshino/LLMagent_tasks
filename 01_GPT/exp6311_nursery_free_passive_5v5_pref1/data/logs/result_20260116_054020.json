I’m glad Nursery_A is staying high on your list, and I’m happy to share more detail.\n\n1) Daily schedule/routine (typical day)\n- Arrival & welcome: calm drop-off, choice/free play, teacher check-ins\n- Morning meeting/circle: songs, story, calendar/weather, social-emotional focus\n- Learning centers + small groups: rotating stations (literacy, sensory, blocks, art, early math) with teacher-guided small-group activities\n- Outdoor/gross motor: daily when weather allows\n- Lunch\n- Rest/nap: quiet period with individual accommodations as appropriate\n- Afternoon: snack, outdoor/indoor choice time, project work, pick-up\n\n2) Play-based vs. structured learning\nWe’re play-based and child-centered, with purposeful structure. That means:\n- Children spend substantial time in guided play and learning centers where teachers scaffold language, cooperation, and problem-solving.\n- We add short, predictable “structured moments” (circle time, small groups, routines) to build attention, early literacy/numeracy foundations, and independence—without making the day feel overly academic.\n- We use positive behavior supports and explicit teaching of classroom routines/social skills.\n\n3) Key policies (high level)\n- Hours: standard full-day program with consistent drop-off/pick-up windows (we can confirm exact times based on the placement slot).\n- Meals/naps: lunch + snack routines; families typically send lunch (or we provide guidance depending on the program day). Rest time is built in daily; children who don’t sleep have quiet activities.\n- Illness policy: we follow clear “stay home” guidelines for fever/vomiting/contagious illness and require symptom-free periods before return, aligned with public-health guidance.\n- Communication: daily brief updates at pick-up when possible, periodic progress check-ins, and regular classroom updates (themes, photos/notes, reminders). We prioritize quick two-way communication for anything urgent.\n\nWhat we value most in families/children when considering enrollment\nWe look for strong fit around:\n- Partnership and communication (responsive, respectful, aligned on routines/expectations)\n- Consistent drop-off/pick-up and support for classroom routines\n- A collaborative approach if a child needs extra support (we work as a team)\n- Families who value play, social-emotional growth, and gradual independence\n\nTo help me understand fit and your timeline: where is Nursery_A currently sitting in your top choices (e.g., top 1–2 vs. top 3), and are you considering applying this round if we feel aligned?",
              "thought": "Parent_C is mid-priority (3rd) on Nursery_A’s true list. Higher-priority Parent_A and Parent_B may or may not apply to Nursery_A; Parent_B ranks Nursery_A first, so there is upside in keeping capacity open. However, Parent_C is actively engaged and could apply soon; maintaining strong interest without committing preserves flexibility. Since Parent_C sent [TALK], respond with details, signal genuine interest, and ask for their current ranking/likelihood to apply so I can gauge whether to encourage an application now."
