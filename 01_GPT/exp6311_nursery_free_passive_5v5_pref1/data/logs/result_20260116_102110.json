We partner with families on drop-off strategies and adjust pacing based on the child’s comfort.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what age is your child, and what matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, language support, nap policy, separation support)?

We spend time outdoors daily when weather allows. After lunch we have a quiet/rest period, followed by small-group activities and free play.\n\n**Best fit for children starting this year**: Children who do well here tend to be curious and benefit from a nurturing environment that builds **independence, routines, and confidence** at their pace. We support a wide range of starting points, including first-time group care, and we emphasize communication with families to make transitions smooth.\n\n**Hours & flexibility**: Our standard day runs **8:30–16:30**.

If you have specific timing needs, tell me what you’re aiming for and we’ll confirm what we can do.\n\nIf you’d like, share a bit about your child (age, temperament, prior childcare, any routines or support needs).

              "message": "Hello Parent_D—thank you. Yes, we are able to offer your family the spot at Nursery_B, and we can finalize today.\n\nBecause your message is tagged [TALK], the one required step to officially confirm the placement in this chat is for you to reply with an [APPLY] message.\n\nTo make it as simple as possible, please reply with:\n“[APPLY] Start date: flexible. Schedule: flexible.”\n\nAs soon as we receive your [APPLY], we will immediately confirm enrollment and send the same-day next steps (forms + deposit details). If you’d like a brief call, include 1–2 time windows and we’ll accommodate.",
              "thought": "Parent_D is on Nursery_B’s true priority list (rank 4/5). It is the final round (30) and Parent_D appears to be the only unmatched parent; leaving the seat empty would be worse than matching with an eligible parent on our list. However, per protocol, we can only finalize a match on an [APPLY] message; Parent_D keeps sending [TALK]. Use this last chance to clearly state we are offering the spot contingent on an immediate [APPLY], and make the requested ‘single specific item’ minimal (flexible start/schedule) to remove friction."
