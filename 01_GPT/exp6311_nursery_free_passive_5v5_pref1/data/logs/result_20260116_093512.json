We look for a good fit where a child can feel secure, curious, and supported.\n2) **Consistent, proactive communication**: We value clear, two-way communication with families. You can expect regular updates on your child’s week, quick check-ins as needed, and scheduled conferences.\n3) **Partnership with families**: We appreciate families who collaborate with us—sharing what works at home, goals for their child, and any needs early so we can support smoothly.\n4) **Schedule and transitions**: We try to be flexible where possible, and we prioritize predictable routines for children. If you share your ideal schedule and any constraints, I can tell you how well we can accommodate it.\n\n**Steps & timing**\n- At this stage, the key next step is to **submit an application when you’re ready** (and/or request a brief visit if you’d like, depending on availability).\n- We encourage families who are strongly interested to apply sooner rather than later, as we have limited capacity.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you accurately:\n1) What start date are you aiming for, and what schedule (days/hours) do you need?\n2) Any priorities for your child (e.g., temperament, support needs, language environment) that you’d like us to be aware of?\n\nHappy to answer anything else you’re considering as you compare options.",
