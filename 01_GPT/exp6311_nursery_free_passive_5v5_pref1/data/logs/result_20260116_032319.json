We keep close communication with families and focus on smooth transitions and social-emotional development.\n\nOn availability: we do have one place overall, but in early rounds we’re still speaking with multiple families, so I can’t promise a spot will remain later. That said, it can happen that families choose other options, and we do revisit availability as decisions come in.\n\nIf Nursery_D could become a realistic option for you, it would help to know (1) your child’s age/start date needs, and (2) what matters most to you (hours, outdoor time, language support, etc.). I’m glad to stay in touch this round and next.",
