For separation anxiety, we:\n- Do a gradual settling-in plan when needed (short initial days, then build)\n- Keep drop-offs calm and consistent (a clear goodbye routine; we’ll coach you on what works)\n- Assign a key educator as the main “safe base” early on\n- Offer comfort objects when appropriate and use co-regulation strategies (quiet corner, breathing, sensory tools)\n- Communicate quickly after drop-off if a child is upset, and follow up once they’re settled\n\n4) Family communication (week-to-week)\n- Regular photos/updates and notes on key moments (meals, naps/rest, activities)\n- Quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up as needed\n- Periodic developmental check-ins/conferences (and additional meetings anytime concerns come up)\n- Clear, proactive messaging about routines, upcoming themes/events, and any classroom-wide notes\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor this precisely: your child’s age and your desired start date?
