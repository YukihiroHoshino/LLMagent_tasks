Educators observe interests and tailor small-group activities accordingly.\n\n**Transitions support:** For new starters, we plan a gradual transition (short initial visits if possible), assign a consistent key caregiver, and use familiar routines/comfort items to help children feel secure. We also prepare children for room/activity changes with advance warnings and simple “next/then” prompts.\n\n**Communication with parents:** We prioritize regular, two-way communication—brief daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up, and periodic check-ins to discuss progress and any concerns.

Could you please confirm now whether you can extend the offer to us this round? If not, please clearly let us know so we can finalize our plans. Thank you.",
