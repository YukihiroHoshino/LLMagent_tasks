We value the outcomes/ownership mindset you mentioned, and your interest in proceeding immediately is a strong signal.\n\nNext step: we’ll schedule a fast hiring loop (role-focused interview + execution/ownership discussion) within the next 1–2 rounds. If you can, please share (1) your most relevant recent project with measurable impact and (2) your availability over the next few days so we can lock times.\n\nWe’re looking forward to it.",
