We’re especially looking for a warm, structured environment with consistent communication and plenty of outdoor/play-based learning. If accepted, we’re ready to confirm promptly and partner closely with your teachers. Thank you for considering our application.",

Given uniform nursery priorities (A>B>C>D>E) and that Parent_A/B/C are higher priority everywhere, they likely already matched; applying immediately maximizes my chance to lock in my first choice rather than risk ending up at Nursery_E."

Based on what you shared (warm, structured care, consistent communication, and plenty of outdoor/play-based learning), we believe Nursery_D would be a strong fit for your family.\n\nWe’re happy to offer you our available place. If you’re ready to confirm promptly as noted, please reply with your confirmation and any key details we should prepare for (your child’s age, start date preference, any allergies/medical needs, and nap/rest needs). We’ll then share the next steps for enrollment and schedule a brief welcome chat with your child’s lead educator.\n\nWe look forward to partnering with you.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_D Admissions",
              "thought": "Parent_D is on our true priority list but ranked 4/5. However, we have remaining quota 1 and only Parent_D and Parent_E are unmatched. Parent_E ranks even lower (5th). Parent_D states Nursery_D is first choice and can confirm promptly, reducing risk of ending unmatched. Accepting Parent_D secures a match and is preferable to waiting for higher-ranked parents who are already matched or not in this round."
