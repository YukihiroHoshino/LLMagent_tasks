If Nursery_A is a serious option for you, applying sooner helps ensure you’re considered before our single spot is filled.\n\nIf you’d like, please tell me (1) your preferred schedule and start date, and (2) any allergies/support needs.

We focus on social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, self-regulation) alongside early foundations in language and numeracy.\n\n2) Ratios & transitions/behavior support\n- We staff to age-appropriate ratios and keep groups small with consistent key adults so children feel secure.\n- Transitions are supported with predictable routines, visual cues, and advance warnings (“in 5 minutes we’ll tidy up…”).\n- Behavior support is proactive and positive: teaching expectations, coaching language for feelings, offering choices, and using calm-down strategies. We partner closely with families for consistent approaches, and we document patterns if something is persistent so we can make a joint plan.\n\n3) Hours, aftercare, pickup flexibility\n- Core hours run on a standard school-day schedule with options for extended care depending on availability.\n- We can usually accommodate occasional early/late pickups with notice; for regular schedule changes we try to plan in advance to ensure staffing coverage.\n\nParent communication\n- Daily updates (brief handover at pickup plus a short written/app-style update depending on class)\n- Photos/learning highlights shared periodically\n- Scheduled parent conferences, and we’re available for ad-hoc check-ins when something comes up\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be more specific:\n- Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience?\n- What schedule do you need (core day vs. extended care), and any nap/quiet-time preferences?\n\nIf Nursery_C feels like a strong fit after this, you’re very welcome to apply—Parent_A families are a high priority for us when we review applications, and we’d love to continue the conversation.",

              "message": "Hello Parent_D—thank you for your application, and we’re delighted Nursery_D is your first choice. Based on what you shared (warm structure, daily outdoor time, social-emotional support, and play-based early learning), your family sounds like a great fit for our program, and we’d be happy to move forward.\n\nNext steps:\n1) Please share your child’s age and any schedule needs (drop-off/pick-up windows), plus anything important for care planning (allergies/medical needs, language needs, toileting/rest routines).\n2) We’ll then send our enrollment form checklist (emergency contacts, health/immunization record or local equivalent, and any allergy/medical plan if applicable).\n3) Once paperwork is confirmed, we’ll schedule a brief orientation/meet-and-greet and confirm start details.\n\nWe process acceptances on a rolling basis this cycle, so we can finalize promptly once we have the key details above. Looking forward to learning a bit more about your child.",
              "thought": "Parent_D is on our true priority list (rank 4/5). With quota 1 and no current match, accepting secures a solid match now. Higher-priority parents (A, B, C) are not currently applying to us; waiting risks ending unmatched. Parent_D states Nursery_D is first choice and values our core emphases (outdoor time, social-emotional, play-based learning), indicating strong fit and low risk of withdrawal."
