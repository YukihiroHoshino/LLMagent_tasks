You’ll shadow key stakeholders (product/engineering/ops depending on role) and ship a small “starter” deliverable to learn our standards.\n- **Weeks 3–8 (Ownership Ramp):** You take ownership of a well-scoped project with measurable outcomes (e.g., improving a workflow, delivering a feature/module, or operationalizing a process). You’ll have a dedicated mentor plus weekly 1:1s with your manager; we do lightweight design/plan reviews before execution.\n- **Months 3–6 (Primary Owner):** You become the primary owner for a larger initiative or a recurring area (roadmap slice, system/component, or business process). Expect to write the plan, align stakeholders, execute, and report results. By month 6, we expect you to be operating with high autonomy in your area.\n\n**Mentorship + Support**\n- Assigned mentor (peer-level) for day-to-day questions.\n- Weekly manager 1:1 focused on priorities, unblockers, and growth.\n- Regular feedback cycles (we prefer frequent, actionable feedback over surprise reviews).\n\n**Evaluation criteria (how we measure success)**\n- **Impact:** Did you deliver outcomes that matter (quality, speed, measurable improvement)?\n- **Ownership:** Do you drive clarity, make decisions, and follow through?\n- **Collaboration:** Do stakeholders trust you; do you communicate proactively?\n- **Craft/Execution:** Sound judgment, strong fundamentals, and reliability.\n\n**Profiles that do best here**\n- People who like **clear ownership** and are comfortable making progress amid ambiguity.\n- Strong communicators who can align stakeholders and keep projects moving.\n- Pragmatic builders: bias to shipping, measuring, iterating.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can be more concrete:\n1) What function/role are you targeting (e.g., product, engineering, analytics, ops)?\n2) When you say “growth,” do you mean scope/leadership growth, technical depth, or both?\n3) Which 1–2 factors will decide your top choice this round (compensation, mentorship, autonomy, domain, team)?\n\nIf you share that, I can map a realistic first project and success metrics to your background.",

I’m ready to move forward immediately and would love to contribute from day one. If helpful, I can share a quick 30-60-90 day plan tailored to your needs.

If you’re willing, please send that brief 30/60/90 plan (even bullet points) after this—especially what you’d prioritize in the first 2–3 weeks and how you’d measure impact by day 60. We’ll use it to align your onboarding and first project ownership.\n\nWelcome aboard—looking forward to working together.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only two seekers remain unmatched: Seeker_C and Seeker_E. Our true priority list ranks Seeker_E last, but still acceptable. Seeker_E states we are their top choice and is applying now; accepting secures a match this round. Seeker_C has repeatedly signaled Company_E is lower on their list and has not applied, so waiting risks ending unmatched. Given market uncertainty and our preference to fill with anyone on our list over leaving unfilled, accept Seeker_E now."
