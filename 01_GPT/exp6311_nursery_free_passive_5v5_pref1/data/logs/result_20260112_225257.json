Given Seeker_E ranks us first, they may be hard to retain if we reject, but our objective is to match as high as possible on our list; early rejection preserves flexibility to pursue Seeker_A/Seeker_B/Seeker_C/Seeker_D who all rank us last, meaning we may still end up unmatched later. However, with all companies sharing identical priorities, top seekers will likely go to their top-choice companies, leaving us with lower-ranked options; still, we should not lock in the lowest-ranked option immediately.
