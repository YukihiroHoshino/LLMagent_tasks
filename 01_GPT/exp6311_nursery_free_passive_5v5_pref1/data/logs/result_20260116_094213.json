Children who don’t nap can do calm activities (books, puzzles) so nappers can rest.\n\n4) Application review timeline\n- If you apply, we usually acknowledge receipt quickly and then review on a rolling basis.

We tailor this to the child’s temperament and your schedule.\n- **Primary-point educator:** We try to ensure a consistent key adult is especially attentive during arrival, helping your child build a secure relationship quickly.\n- **Predictable goodbye routine:** We coach families on a calm, consistent drop-off (clear goodbye, reassure, then handoff). We’ll support you through the first days—most children settle faster with consistency.\n- **Comfort + regulation supports:** Comfort objects are welcome; we use gentle co-regulation strategies (quiet corner, sensory tools, books, breathing/movement) and keep expectations developmentally appropriate.\n- **Ongoing check-ins:** If separation is hard, we’ll agree on a plan (e.g., we send a quick update after 15–30 minutes once they’re engaged).\n\n**(2) Day-to-day communication with families**\n- **Daily handoff notes:** Quick in-person check-in at drop-off/pick-up whenever possible (sleep, mood, anything to know).\n- **Regular updates:** We share short updates about the day (highlights, meals/rest, notable moments). If a child is having a tough transition day, we proactively reach out rather than waiting until pickup.\n- **Deeper touchpoints:** We offer scheduled check-ins/conferences periodically and are available for ad-hoc meetings if something comes up (sleep changes, behavior questions, developmental milestones).\n- **Partnership approach:** We aim for “no surprises”—if there’s an ongoing concern, we discuss it early and collaborate on a consistent plan between home and school.\n\n**Qualities we value most in a family partnership**\n- **Open, respectful communication** (sharing context from home; asking questions early).\n- **Consistency with routines** (especially around arrival/pick-up and sleep/toileting transitions).\n- **Collaborative mindset** (we problem-solve together; we’re on the same team).\n- **Trust and follow-through** (if we agree on a strategy, we try it consistently long enough to evaluate).\n\nTo tailor this to your child: how old are they, and how do they typically do with new caregivers/separation?
