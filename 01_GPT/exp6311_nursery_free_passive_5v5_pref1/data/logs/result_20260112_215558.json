I’m still interested, but before I decide whether to submit a formal application, could you share (1) your top 2–3 must-have criteria for this opening, (2) what would make someone an immediate strong fit in the first 30–60 days, and (3) whether you expect to make a decision this round or can wait another round? If it’s a strong match and timing is tight, I’m prepared to move quickly.",

Since I haven’t received any concrete info from Company_D yet and applying now could lock me into my worst acceptable match, I will continue talking to gauge fit and timeline while keeping flexibility to pursue Company_E."

Seeker_D ranks us #1, while Seeker_E ranks us #5 and is likely to prefer other companies if available—however those companies may already be matched. Since Seeker_E is engaging and may move quickly, keep them warm but avoid committing; try to elicit an [APPLY] only if they can commit quickly, while leaving room to accept Seeker_D if they apply. In this turn they sent [TALK], so respond with [TALK], clarify must-haves and timeline, and ask for a concrete signal/commitment and brief evidence of fit."
