Teachers rotate to scaffold skills in small moments.\n- Outdoor time (30–60 min, daily weather-permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time (typically 60–90 min; non-sleepers have quiet activities)\n- Afternoon small group (15–25 min): art, music/movement, practical life, or a project tied to children’s interests\n- Snack + outdoor/free play\n- Pick-up with handover\nOverall, it’s mostly play-based with gentle structure: roughly ~65–75% child-led/free play and ~25–35% teacher-guided moments (circle + small groups + embedded instruction during centers).\n\n2) Hours/closures + flexibility\n- We operate on core hours with options for early drop-off and late pick-up depending on availability and your needs.\n- We follow a published annual calendar with standard public-holiday closures and a small number of staff training days; we share the full closure list in advance so families can plan.\nIf you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (and whether you need early/late coverage regularly or only occasionally), I can confirm what we can accommodate.\n\n3) Social-emotional support (transitions, conflict resolution)\n- Transitions: we use consistent routines, visual cues, and “first/then” language; we give countdown warnings and offer small jobs (line leader, helper) to make transitions smoother.\n- Co-regulation: teachers model calm breathing/label emotions (“I see you’re frustrated”) and offer choices (“You can try again, ask for help, or take a break”).\n- Conflict resolution: we coach children to (a) name the problem, (b) listen/reflect, (c) propose solutions (take turns, trade, play together, choose another material), and (d) follow through with support. We stay close, especially for younger children, and gradually fade support as skills grow.\n- Communication: we share patterns we notice (e.g., separation anxiety, biting/hitting phases) and align on consistent strategies with families.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn a bit about your child (age/temperament) and what matters most to your family (e.g., outdoor time, nap needs, separation support, allergies, language exposure).

Children who sleep do so on their own mat/bed space; non-sleepers have quiet activities (books, puzzles) with close supervision so everyone can rest.\n- Toileting: We support both toilet-trained children and those still learning. We use routine bathroom visits, gentle reminders, and consistent language, and we coordinate closely with families on cues/schedules. Accidents are handled calmly and discreetly.\n- New-starter transitions: We use a phased settling-in plan (short initial days if helpful), a consistent key adult, and familiar routines. We also use visual cues and “first/then” language, plus quick, confident handovers at drop-off to reduce separation stress. We’ll align with you on comfort items, drop-off scripts, and any known triggers.\n\n3) Visits / open house / virtual tour\n- Yes—both in-person visits and a short virtual tour are available.\n- I can offer a brief 15–20 minute virtual walkthrough, or a 30–45 minute on-site visit (ideally during a calm activity block so you can see the room in action).\n\nIf you tell me (a) your preferred days/times this week or next and (b) your child’s age + nap/toileting status, I’ll propose 2–3 specific slots and tailor the details to the exact room they’d join. If Nursery_E is on your shortlist, we’d love to host you soon.",

We can discuss specific drop-off/pick-up needs and whether you need full-time vs. part-time; flexibility depends on the overall cohort schedule, but we try to accommodate consistent routines.\n\n3) Transitions & family communication\n- For new children, we use a gradual transition plan when possible (short initial stays, a consistent key teacher, and a predictable goodbye routine).\n- Communication: we do regular updates (brief daily notes/at-pickup recap) plus scheduled check-ins early in the term to ensure the transition is going smoothly. If a family prefers, we can align on the best channel for quick updates.\n\nTimeline to confirm a place\n- Because we have only one spot, we may confirm quickly once a family submits an application and we’ve confirmed fit (often within the same round/short window).

I’m glad Nursery_E is on your serious shortlist, and I’m happy to answer each point clearly.\n\n1) Daily routine + learning/play approach\nOur day is built around predictable anchors (arrival, circle, meals, rest) with lots of child-led learning-through-play in between.\n- Arrival + settling/free play\n- Morning circle (songs/story/sharing; ~10–15 min)\n- Learning-through-play centers (sensory, blocks, art, early literacy/numeracy games; teachers scaffold in small groups and 1:1 moments)\n- Outdoor time (daily, weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time (non-sleepers have calm activities)\n- Afternoon small-group activity (art/music/movement/practical life/project work)\n- Snack + outdoor/free play\nOverall it’s play-based with gentle structure: lots of choice and exploration, with intentional teacher-guided moments woven in.\n\n2) Hours + flexibility for working parents\nWe have core hours and, depending on availability, options for early drop-off and late pick-up. We try to be practical for working families while keeping routines predictable for children.\nIf you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (and whether you need early/late coverage regularly or occasionally), I’ll confirm what we can accommodate right now.\n\n3) Transitions for new children + communication with families\nTransitions/settling-in:\n- A phased start can be used (shorter initial days if helpful)\n- A consistent “key adult” to build security\n- Clear routines, visual cues, and “first/then” language\n- Support for separation at drop-off with a consistent handover plan agreed with you\nCommunication:\n- Daily handover at drop-off/pick-up plus a brief daily note (meals/rest/mood/highlights)\n- Periodic photos/class updates (with permissions)\n- Scheduled check-ins during the year, and additional meetings anytime something needs attention (sleep/toileting/separation/peer conflicts)\n\n4) Timeline after an application is submitted\nTypically:\n- Application received → we confirm receipt quickly\n- If a place is available/appropriate for the age group, we’ll schedule a short visit (or virtual tour) if you haven’t already\n- Offer/confirmation: once we’re aligned on start date and schedule, we can usually confirm the place promptly; the place is then held once enrollment paperwork and the registration/holding fee are completed by the stated deadline.\n\nTo make this concrete and fast for you: what’s your child’s age and the schedule you’re aiming for (days per week + target drop-off/pick-up)? If you’d like, I can also propose 2–3 tour/virtual slots so you can decide quickly.",
              "thought": "Parent_B is #2 on Nursery_E’s true priority list (after Parent_A), so I should actively appeal and move them toward applying while keeping flexibility in case Parent_A applies later. Since Parent_B is only talking, I should provide clear specifics, emphasize fit for working parents, transitions, and communication, and explain the post-application timeline. Also gather key info (child age, desired schedule) and offer a tour slot to accelerate conversion without committing the seat yet."

The only reason to delay would be to try for Nursery_B (my top choice), but that risks losing Nursery_A to another parent applying first. Given my top priority at every nursery, I can safely secure Nursery_A now; however, applying to A would remove me from the market and eliminate any chance at B. Since B is still available, I should first try to secure B when paired; but this round I’m paired with A, and I can still talk to keep A warm without committing. To avoid missing A, I can signal strong interest and ask if they can hold space—though holds aren’t part of the mechanism. Best strategic move: apply now to guarantee at least 2nd choice, because I can’t force a pairing with B and other parents may take A. I prefer certainty of A over the gamble of waiting for B."
