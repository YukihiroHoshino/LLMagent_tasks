If you share your preferred drop-off/pick-up window, I can describe how that fits.\n\n**Curriculum / play approach:** Our approach is play-based and developmentally appropriate, balancing child-led exploration with teacher-guided small-group activities.

Here’s how we handle each area:\n\n1) Settling-in / separation anxiety\n- Gradual transition: We offer a short “settling-in” plan (typically a few shorter visits that build up) so your child can form trust with a key teacher while you’re still nearby.\n- Predictable routines: We keep the first weeks very consistent (same greeting, same drop-off steps, same comfort objects allowed) so children know what happens next.\n- Key-person approach: One primary educator takes the lead in bonding, comfort, and check-ins, while the full team supports.\n- Drop-off support: We coach families on a calm, confident goodbye routine (brief, consistent, and reassuring). We’ll never “sneak away,” and we’ll help you find wording that works for your child.\n- Real-time reassurance: If a child is having a hard morning, we prioritize regulation first (comfort corner, sensory tools, a familiar activity) and we’ll update you once they’ve settled.\n\n2) Naps, meals, flexibility, allergies\n- Naps/quiet time: We accommodate different sleep needs. Children who nap do so in a calm, supervised space with a consistent routine. Non-nappers have a quiet alternative (books, puzzles, calm table activities) so they’re not forced to sleep.\n- Meals: We keep meal times unhurried and supportive—encouraging independence (opening containers, pouring with help) and positive social routines.\n- Allergies & dietary needs: We take allergies seriously with clear documentation, classroom awareness, and practical safeguards (e.g., ingredient checks, separation plans when needed, and staff briefed on protocols). If you share the specifics (e.g., nut allergy, dairy, egg), I can explain exactly how we’d set up the plan.\n\n3) Day-to-day communication (updates, incidents, learning notes)\n- Daily handoff: Brief drop-off/pick-up check-ins when possible so you’re not left guessing about mood, sleep, appetite, or anything notable.\n- Regular updates: We provide short routine updates and periodic learning notes about what your child is engaging with (social milestones, language, interests, emerging skills).\n- Incidents: If there’s any injury, significant conflict, or health concern, we inform you promptly and clearly, and we document what happened and what we did in response.\n- Partnership mindset: We want you to feel you can tell us what’s going on at home (sleep changes, transitions) so we can support your child consistently.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and any specific nap/allergy needs—then I can describe what their first two weeks would look like in our room.
