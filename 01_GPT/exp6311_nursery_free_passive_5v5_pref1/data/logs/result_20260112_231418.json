Given all companies share the same priority order, top seekers (A/B/C) are likely to be contested and may match elsewhere quickly; rejecting Seeker_D risks ending up with an even lower-ranked candidate or no match within our single quota. With no prior commitments and a strong, immediate-fit applicant who prefers us most, accepting secures a stable match this round."

Since this is round 1 and I have higher true preferences (Company_C, then B, then A) that I should pursue first, I should not apply to E yet. However, maintaining optionality is useful, so I will initiate a light conversation to gauge fit and keep the door open without committing."

Also, are you currently in active processes with other companies, and what timeline are you aiming for?",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is mid-tier (3rd) on our true priority list. In seekers' preferences, Company_E is last for Seeker_C, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere.

Preserve option to accept later if higher-priority seekers don't materialize."

If I delay, Seeker_C may secure Company_C, and I may be pushed to my 3rd choice (Company_B) or worse.
