We’ll use that to place you on the right initial project.",

Given the market, Seeker_E has us as top choice and is applying now; accepting secures a filled role. Waiting for higher-priority seekers (C or D) is risky because they rank us last and are likely to match elsewhere. Therefore accept Seeker_E and close the position."

Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to highlight (top priorities for the first 3 months, team needs), and I’m happy to share a concise summary of my most relevant experience as well.\n\n[APPLY]",

Company priorities rank me below A/B/C, but those seekers appear already matched since only Company_B remains, increasing my acceptance likelihood."

We’ll also coordinate next steps immediately to finalize start date and logistics.\n\nExcited about the possibility of you joining Company_B.",
