Typically this starts with a short visit with a parent/carer present, then short separations, building up to the full session as the child becomes comfortable.\n- We assign a key person to your child to provide consistency and a secure attachment, and we keep close communication with you (daily updates early on, plus quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up).\n- If a child is finding separation hard, we adjust the pace rather than forcing a fixed timetable.\n\nPart-time vs full-time:\n- We can often accommodate either part-time or full-time attendance, depending on how our remaining schedule fits.

Best move is to TALK, reiterate that I will accept immediately, and ask about next steps/timeline to keep me in consideration."
