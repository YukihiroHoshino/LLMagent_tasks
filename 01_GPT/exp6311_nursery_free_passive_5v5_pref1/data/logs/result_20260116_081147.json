When relevant, we also take into account practical considerations like proximity/commute reliability and sibling connections.\n\nInfo sessions: we run short meet-and-greet visits on a rolling basis. If you share a few times that work for you next week, we can propose a slot.\n\nDeadlines: we accept applications on a rolling basis, and earlier applications are helpful for planning. If Nursery_D remains on your shortlist, you’re welcome to apply after a visit (or sooner if you already feel ready).\n\nTo help us advise you best, could you tell me your preferred start date and the schedule you’re looking for (days/hours), plus anything important about your child’s needs or interests?",

If multiple families apply at the same time, we use that priority order to decide.\n\nA couple quick questions to help me advise you well:\n1) What age group are you applying for and what start date are you hoping for?\n2) What matters most to your family (hours, outdoor time, language environment, proximity, etc.)?\n\nIf Nursery_C feels like a strong fit after this, you’re welcome to apply this round or a future round—either is fine.",
