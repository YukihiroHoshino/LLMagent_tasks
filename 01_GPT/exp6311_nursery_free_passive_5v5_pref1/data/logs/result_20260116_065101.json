We value families who are aligned with our routines (drop-off/pick-up consistency), support children’s independence (self-care, trying tasks before asking for help), and are open to collaborating if a child needs extra support.\n\n**Typical day / program focus:** our day is structured but play-based—children get a predictable routine (arrival/settling in, circle time, learning centers, outdoor/gross-motor play, meals/snack, rest/quiet time, and small-group activities). We emphasize social-emotional development, language/early literacy through stories and conversation, and hands-on exploration (art, sensory play, simple science activities).\n\nTo help me understand fit, could you share your child’s age, any supports/allergies we should know about, and what you’re hoping your child gains most this year?

I’m still very interested in finding the best fit and wanted to ask a couple quick practical questions: (1) Do you offer any phased/shorter days for the first 1–2 weeks to support settling in? (2) What’s your caregiver-to-child ratio and how do you handle key-person assignment/communication with families? (3) If offered a place, what is the expected response/commitment timeline? Appreciate any details you can share.",
              "thought": "Nursery_D is last on my true preference list, so I should avoid committing unless necessary. Only Nursery_A and Nursery_D remain unmatched; given universal nursery priorities (A>B>C>D>E by parent order) and Parent_A being top priority everywhere, Parent_A is likely to take Nursery_A, leaving Nursery_D as my likely remaining option if I want to be matched. Since I have only talked with Nursery_D before and not applied, I should continue talking and signal interest without applying yet, to preserve flexibility in case Nursery_A becomes available."

              "message": "Hello Parent_B—happy to clarify, and we’d be very pleased to consider your family.\n\n1) Phased/shorter days (first 1–2 weeks): Yes. We can offer a gradual settling-in plan (e.g., shorter mornings for a few days, then extending to lunch, then full days), tailored to your child’s comfort and your schedule. We’ll agree the plan in advance and adjust if we see your child needs a slower/faster transition.\n\n2) Ratio + key-person/communication: We staff to maintain close supervision and strong relationship-building, with a designated key person assigned at/just before start. The key person is your main point of contact for day-to-day settling, routines (drop-off, naps/rest, meals), and developmental updates, and we also ensure another familiar staff member can step in for continuity. We do regular check-ins during the first 1–2 weeks and ongoing updates thereafter.\n\n3) Offer/response timeline: If we extend an offer, we typically ask for confirmation within a short window (usually a few days) so we can finalize staffing and the transition plan. If you need a bit more time due to coordinating with work/other schools, tell us upfront and we’ll try to accommodate where possible.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing your child’s age, desired start window, and the days/hours you need, I can confirm whether we can align a phased start with your schedule—and if Nursery_D is moving to the top of your list, you’re welcome to submit an application and we can move quickly from there.",

Parent_D (also on our list but ranked lower) remains unmatched; securing Parent_B would be preferable if they are willing to apply soon. Parent_B currently has Nursery_A as top choice and Nursery_D as last, so they may be shopping; we should answer clearly, reduce friction, and invite an application while signaling we can move quickly with a short response window."

If helpful for your decision: we’re reliable with drop-off/pick-up, value close home–school communication, and we’re committed to partnering with teachers to support routines and behavior consistently. Please let me know if there’s any specific information you’d like from us to complete your assessment.",
