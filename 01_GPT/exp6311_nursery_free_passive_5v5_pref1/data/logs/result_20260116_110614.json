At Nursery_D, our day is structured but play-led: we use a consistent routine (arrival/settling-in, morning circle, learning/play centers, outdoor time, lunch/rest, afternoon small-group activities) so children feel secure, while still giving them choice and agency through rotating stations.\n\n**Play/learning balance:** We emphasize hands-on learning through guided play—early literacy and numeracy are woven into stories, songs, sensory play, and practical activities rather than long sit-down lessons. Teachers run short, small-group moments for focused skills (e.g., phonological awareness, fine-motor, early counting), and then children apply them in free play.\n\n**Class structure & support:** We keep groups organized with clear teacher roles (lead + support) and use observation notes to tailor activities to each child’s development and interests. We prioritize social-emotional learning—helping children practice routines, sharing, and self-regulation in age-appropriate ways.\n\n**Communication with parents:** You can expect brief daily updates (highlights + any notable needs), plus more detailed periodic progress check-ins. We’re also very open to quick conversations at pick-up/drop-off and will proactively reach out if we notice patterns (sleep, eating, transitions, peer dynamics).\n\nIf you’re looking for a program that combines a warm, nurturing environment with purposeful learning through play, I think you’d be a great fit here. If you’d like, tell me what matters most to your family (schedule, outdoor time, language exposure, communication style), and I can speak to those specifics—and you’re welcome to apply when ready.",

With quota 1 and only Parent_B and Parent_D unmatched, we should consider whether holding out could secure a higher-ranked parent. Nursery_D is Parent_D’s first choice, so accepting yields a stable match now. Parent_B ranks Nursery_D last, so it’s unlikely we’d match with Parent_B if we reject Parent_D. Therefore accept Parent_D to fill our seat with a committed family rather than risk ending unmatched."
