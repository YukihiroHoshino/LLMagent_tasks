Here’s how we approach each of your questions:\n\n1) Helping children settle in (first few weeks)\n- Gradual, child-centered transition: where possible, we offer a short phased start (brief stay with caregiver, then short independent stays, building up) based on the child’s comfort.\n- Key-person approach: we assign a primary teacher who becomes the consistent “secure base” for greetings, comfort, and check-ins.\n- Predictable routines: we keep the daily rhythm very consistent early on (same arrival routine, same transition cues, same cozy settling spot).\n- Comfort objects + family connection: children may bring a comfort item; we also use simple “family photos” or a small goodbye ritual to support separation.\n- Communication during separation: we acknowledge feelings (“It’s hard to say goodbye”), keep boundaries calm and kind, and redirect into a preferred activity/peer connection.\n\n2) Communication with families about a child’s day\n- Daily touchpoint at drop-off/pick-up: quick highlights plus anything you should know (mood, meals, naps, friendships).\n- Regular updates: we share photos/brief notes of classroom activities and learning (frequency can vary by week, but we aim for consistent visibility into the day).\n- If something notable happens: we contact families promptly (e.g., repeated difficulty settling, a significant conflict, a bump/incident) and explain what we observed, what we did, and what we’ll try next.\n- Ongoing partnership: for any recurring theme (sleep, toileting, big feelings, peer dynamics), we align on a simple plan and keep you updated on progress.\n\n3) Handling conflicts between children (age-appropriate)\n- Immediate safety + calm presence: we step in early, block hitting/grabbing, and help everyone reset.\n- Name feelings and needs: “You’re upset because you wanted the truck.” “You didn’t like being pushed.”\n- Coach simple scripts: “Can I have a turn when you’re done?” “Stop, I don’t like that.” “Help, please.”\n- Focus on repair: we guide children to make it better (returning an item, checking on a friend, helping rebuild, offering a gentle apology in a developmentally appropriate way).\n- Teach skills proactively: we practice turn-taking, waiting, and problem-solving in small groups, not only in the moment of conflict.\n- Pattern spotting: if the same conflicts repeat, we adjust the environment (duplicates of popular toys, smaller groups, clearer boundaries) and support specific children with targeted coaching.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: how old is your child, and what do you anticipate will be the biggest part of settling in (separation at drop-off, new routines, naps, peer interactions)? If you’d like, we can also schedule a short visit/call so you can see arrival and transitions in action.",
