I’m confident I can ramp quickly and deliver on the initial milestones you outlined (first 90 days: align on goals, execute the first key project, and communicate progress clearly).

Given all companies share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E among seekers), I (Seeker_E) am lowest priority everywhere, so Company_E and Company_B will likely take a higher-priority seeker if they apply. Since I’ve only talked with Company_D so far and there’s a meaningful risk I end up unmatched if I wait for E or B, I should compromise and apply to Company_D now to secure employment rather than gamble further."
