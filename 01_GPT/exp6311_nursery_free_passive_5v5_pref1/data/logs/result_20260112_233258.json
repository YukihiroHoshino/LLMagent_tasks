We are speaking with other candidates, but we’re not at a signed-offer stage yet.\n\nIf you’re interested, the fastest path is: you share one example of a <90-day delivery you owned (metric + what you personally drove), and we’ll schedule a focused final-fit conversation and get to a decision quickly.

You’d drive: crisp problem statement, scoped milestones, stakeholder alignment, and a weekly execution cadence through launch.\n2) **Put measurement + operating rigor in place** so we can manage outcomes (not just activity): define 1–2 success metrics, stand up a lightweight dashboard, and run a decision/risk log to prevent timeline surprises.\n\n**By day ~90, success looks like:** first release shipped with stakeholder sign-off, clear movement in the agreed metrics (or validated learnings if it’s an experiment), and a repeatable execution rhythm the team can keep using.\n\nTo help us finalize quickly, please send **one concise example** (5–8 bullets) of a project where you delivered something meaningful in <90 days—include: your role, the metric/outcome, key stakeholders, and how you handled trade-offs/ambiguity. Also confirm your earliest start date and any constraints (location/hours).\n\nIf that aligns, we can move to a final decision immediately after reviewing your response.",
