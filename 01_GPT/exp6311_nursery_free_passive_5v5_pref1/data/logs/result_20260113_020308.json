Ideal start date is **as soon as you can reasonably start** (typically **2–4 weeks**), but we can be flexible for the right candidate.\n\n2) **Single most important 30–60 day outcome:** **Take ownership of one high-impact, ambiguous workstream and ship a measurable improvement**—i.e., diagnose the biggest bottleneck/opportunity, align stakeholders on a crisp plan, and deliver at least one meaningful iteration that moves a core metric (adoption/conversion, quality/latency, cost, or operational throughput—depending on the team).\n\nIf you’re ready to move quickly, please send an **[APPLY]** with:\n- 2–3 most relevant projects (your specific role/ownership),\n- the metrics you moved (baseline → result), and\n- a brief 30/60/90-day plan framing what you’d tackle first here.\n\nIf that lines up strongly, we’ll move fast on next steps.",

I’d like to formally apply and be considered for your open role.\n\nI’m ready to move immediately and can commit to a clear 30/60/90-day plan focused on the outcomes you need most. In the first 30 days, I’ll prioritize: (1) getting fully ramped on your workflows and stakeholders, (2) taking ownership of the highest-urgency backlog items, and (3) delivering at least one measurable quick win while documenting processes to make execution repeatable.\n\nIf there’s anything you still need from me to make a decision today (references, work samples, or a brief plan tailored to your top priority), I can send it right away. I’m excited about the chance to contribute at Company_C.",
