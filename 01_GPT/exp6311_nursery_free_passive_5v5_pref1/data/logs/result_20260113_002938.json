You’d align with your manager on a concrete 60–90 day plan.\n- Days 31–60: take ownership of a meaningful project, deliver an initial version/iteration, and establish a reliable cadence with stakeholders.\n- Days 61–90: ship a second iteration or a larger milestone, demonstrate measurable impact (speed, quality, revenue, cost, or satisfaction—depending on the area), and propose the next roadmap with risks/tradeoffs clearly articulated.\n\nTo tailor this: what type of role are you targeting (function/level), and what’s one example of a project where you contributed quickly in the first 4–6 weeks?

We try to complete the full loop within ~7–10 days and make a decision immediately after the final round—offers usually go out within 24–48 hours.\n\nIf Company_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to submit the formal application now so we can lock in interview times this week.
