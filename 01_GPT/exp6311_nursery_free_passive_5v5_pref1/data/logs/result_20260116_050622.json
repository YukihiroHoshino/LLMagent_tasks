              "message": "Hello Parent_A—happy to share more detail.\n\n**Core values / teaching philosophy**\n- **Play-based, child-led with intentional teaching**: we follow children’s interests and use structured routines and small-group moments to build language, early literacy/numeracy foundations, and independence.\n- **Warm, predictable relationships**: a secure attachment to a consistent educator is central (we use a key-person approach).\n- **Whole-child focus**: social-emotional skills, communication, and self-help skills are treated as “core curriculum,” not add-ons.\n\n**Outdoor time**\n- We aim for **daily outdoor play** when weather is safe. Typically this is **at least one substantial block most days**, and on good-weather days we often do **two outdoor periods** (e.g., late morning + afternoon). If weather prevents outdoor time, we provide indoor gross-motor alternatives.\n\n**Social-emotional development & transitions (first weeks / separation anxiety)**\n- **Gradual start** when possible (shorter initial days, building up as your child settles).\n- **Key-person + consistent handoff routine**: the same educator greets your child and supports good-bye rituals.\n- **Emotion coaching**: we label feelings, offer choices, and teach simple calming strategies (breathing, sensory tools, cozy corner).\n- **Predictable routines + visual cues**: helps children know what comes next, reducing anxiety.\n- **Proactive parent partnership**: we’ll agree on a consistent drop-off plan (what to say, how long to stay, comfort item, etc.) and review it after a few days.\n\n**Teacher stability / turnover**\n- We prioritize **staff continuity** and schedule to keep children with familiar adults. Like any early-years setting, occasional changes can happen, but our goal is to minimize disruption through team planning and overlap/handovers so children keep a stable “known adult.” If you’d like, I can share how long our current lead educators have been with Nursery_E (by age room) once I know your child’s age group.\n\n**Communication with parents**\n- **Daily handover** at drop-off/pick-up for quick updates.\n- **Regular written updates** (often via a simple digital channel) covering meals, naps/rest, key moments, and any concerns.\n- **Planned check-ins** during the settling-in period.\n- **Parent conferences** (and additional meetings as needed) to discuss development goals and progress.\n\nIf you share (1) your child’s age, (2) the schedule you need (full/part day), and (3) any specific worries around separation, sleep, or allergies, I can tailor exactly how we’d support your child.\n\nAnd if Nursery_E is a realistic option for your shortlist, you’re welcome to **apply as soon as you’re ready**—once offer rounds begin, places can move quickly.\n\n[TALK]",

And if it’s feeling like a strong fit, you’re welcome to apply soon—our single place can fill quickly once a family confirms.\n\nWhat schedule are you considering (full-time vs specific days), and when would you ideally like to start?",

We’re pleased to offer you a place at Nursery_E.\n\nPlease confirm acceptance, and we’ll send the enrollment packet and document checklist right away (ID/emergency contacts, health/allergy information, immunization records as applicable, and start-date/schedule details). We’re looking forward to welcoming your family.",
              "thought": "Parent_E is on our true priority list but ranked lowest (5th). We still have full quota (1) and only Parent_C remains unmatched besides Parent_E. Given all nurseries share the same priority list, Parent_C (ranked above Parent_E) could still become available, but Parent_C’s first choice is Nursery_C and they may match elsewhere; meanwhile Parent_E is applying now and states Nursery_E is their first choice with immediate confirmation. With limited rounds and risk of ending unmatched, accepting Parent_E secures a filled seat with a committed family. If a higher-priority parent later applied, we could regret accepting, but the matching rules remove us from further negotiation once matched, so we must weigh certainty vs potential improvement. Given only one remaining alternative and no signal Parent_C will apply to us, accept Parent_E."
