For social-emotional growth, staff model emotion language, help children practice turn-taking and conflict resolution, and partner with families on consistent strategies.\n\nHours & flexibility: We offer standard drop-off/pick-up windows and can discuss limited flexibility depending on staffing and your needs.

Teachers stay close to model language and prevent escalation.\n- Emotion coaching: we explicitly teach coping tools (breathing, sensory tools, quiet corner) and practice them when children are calm.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and any specific concerns (shyness, big feelings, transition challenges), I can be even more concrete about what their day would look like here.

Our approach is play-based and child-centered: we set up intentional activities and environments, then follow children’s interests while building foundational skills (language, self-regulation, problem-solving, peer play).\n\n(2) Communication with families:\nWe prioritize frequent, practical communication—brief daily updates at drop-off/pick-up when possible, plus regular written updates (highlights from the week, what we’re working on, and ways to extend learning at home). We also offer scheduled check-ins/conferences and are available to collaborate if any concerns arise (sleep, transitions, social dynamics, etc.).\n\n(3) Distinctive strengths:\n• Outdoor time is a key part of our day whenever weather allows.\n• Strong emphasis on social-emotional development (emotion language, gentle coaching, routines that support independence).\n• Small-group work to support language development and early learning through hands-on activities.\n\nAvailability this cycle:\nWe anticipate having limited availability (we’re currently filling our remaining spot), so timing matters.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applicants:\nBecause we have limited seats, we prioritize families who are a good fit for our routines and values—consistent attendance, collaborative communication, and alignment on supporting independence, kindness, and predictable structure for children.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, I can be more specific: your child’s age, ideal start date, any allergies/support needs, and your typical drop-off/pick-up times.

Children get long stretches of choice-based play/centers, and teachers add structure through short, purposeful moments (circle time, small-group language/math games, social-emotional coaching, and project-based activities).\n\n4) Outdoor time + meals/snacks\n- Outdoor time is built in daily when weather allows (typically at least once; often more depending on the day).\n- We provide snacks; lunch arrangements depend on the classroom schedule (some families pack lunch; in some cases we coordinate simple meal options). If you tell me your child’s age and any dietary needs, I can clarify exactly what applies.\n\nTransition support in the first weeks\n- Yes. We use a gradual-entry approach when needed (shorter initial stays), a consistent drop-off routine, a designated “safe person” teacher, comfort-object support, and proactive family communication (quick check-ins plus early updates). We can individualize a settling-in plan if your child tends to have separation anxiety or needs extra predictability.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: your child’s age, any schedule constraints, and what you most want your child to gain this year (confidence with peers, language, routine/independence, etc.).
