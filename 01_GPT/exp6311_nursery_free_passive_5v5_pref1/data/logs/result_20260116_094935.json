We balance child-led play with gentle adult-guided activities.\n\nApproach to early learning/play: We’re play-based and relationship-led. Practitioners observe children’s interests and extend learning through hands-on activities (stories, music, sensory play, early mark-making, building, role play). We focus strongly on communication and language, social-emotional development, and early independence (e.g., dressing, tidying, self-care routines), always at each child’s pace.\n\nSettling-in: We use a gradual, individualized settling plan—typically a short initial visit with a parent/carer, then a few shorter sessions, building up to a full session as the child is ready. Each child has a key person who is the main point of contact and supports attachment and consistency. We’ll agree a plan with you and adjust quickly if we see your child needs a slower/faster transition.\n\nWhat we value in families: Open, respectful communication; consistency between home and nursery where possible (sleep/comfort routines, boundaries); and partnership—sharing what works for your child, any sensitivities, languages spoken at home, and what helps them feel safe.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what is your child’s age/temperament, and have they been in group care before? Also, what matters most to you in a nursery (e.g., outdoor time, structure, gentle transitions, early literacy/numeracy exposure)?",
