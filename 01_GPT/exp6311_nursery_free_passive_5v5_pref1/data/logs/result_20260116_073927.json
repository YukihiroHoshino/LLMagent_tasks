We also have periodic open-house slots; the next available windows are usually within the next 1–2 weeks depending on staffing.\n\nIf you share (a) your child’s age, (b) preferred start date, and (c) your weekly schedule needs, I’ll propose 2–3 visit times.

We keep parents updated during the first weeks so you know how it’s settling.\n\n3) **Timing / availability this round**\nWe have **one place** and we expect it could fill **soon on a rolling basis** once a family submits an application and confirms fit/schedule.

However, Parent_E likely targets Nursery_E first and would outrank me at Nursery_E? Actually Nursery_E priority is Parent_A > Parent_B > Parent_C > Parent_D > Parent_E, so I outrank Parent_E there. Still, I should keep E warm as a fallback while continuing to pursue D/A when possible. I have only talked with Nursery_E so far, not applied; in this round I will talk and signal conditional readiness to apply quickly if they can’t hold the spot, while asking if they are about to make an offer so I can decide whether to apply next round."
