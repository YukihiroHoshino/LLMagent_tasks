We balance child-led play with gentle adult-guided learning moments.\n\nStaff-to-child ratio: We maintain small groups with consistent key persons. Ratios follow local requirements, and we aim to staff above the minimum at peak transition times (morning arrival and settling-in) so children get more one-to-one support.\n\nSettling-in/transition: We use a gradual “key-person” approach. Typically:\n1) Short initial visits with a parent/carer present.\n2) Brief separations once the child is comfortable.\n3) Gradually extending time over 1–2 weeks (flexible to the child’s pace).\nWe prioritize consistency (same key adult), clear handover routines, and daily communication so you know how your child is doing.\n\nWhat makes Nursery_E distinctive: We’re especially focused on a calm, nurturing environment and strong communication with families—daily updates plus regular check-ins during the first month to ensure the transition is going smoothly.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and what matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, language support, quieter setting, hours), I can be more specific about how we’d support them—and you’re very welcome to apply if Nursery_E feels like a fit.",

If you occasionally need an earlier/later handover within our opening hours, we can usually accommodate with a quick heads-up so staffing is aligned.\n\n2) Social/emotional support & guidance\nWe use a key-person (key-worker) system so your child has a consistent primary adult for attachment, comfort, and daily check-ins. We focus on co-regulation (helping children name feelings, offering calm choices, and guiding them back to play). For behavior, we use clear, simple boundaries, positive reinforcement, and restorative steps (e.g., “what happened / how can we help / how do we make it right”), rather than punitive approaches. If a child needs extra support, we agree on a consistent plan with you so home and nursery responses match.\n\n3) Communication with parents\nWe do daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily update (highlights, meals, naps, mood) via our parent app. We also share photos/observations (with consent). During settling-in, we proactively message/call if anything stands out and schedule a check-in within the first few weeks. After that, we offer termly meetings (or more often if you’d like) and are always available for a quick chat.\n\nIf you tell me what hours you typically need (and your child’s age), I can confirm the best schedule options for you.

Some children move faster; others benefit from more short visits. We also tailor handover routines (same goodbye script, comfort item, photo card, predictable “what happens next”).\n\n2) Naps/rest time and meals (different ages)\n• Rest/naps: We offer a calm, dimmed rest period after lunch. Younger children who need more sleep can nap longer; older children who don’t sleep can do quiet activities (books, puzzles) so no one is forced to sleep. We follow your home routine as closely as we can and coordinate changes with you.\n• Meals: We support age-appropriate eating—assistance for younger children, encouragement of independence for older ones. We accommodate allergies and dietary requirements and keep you updated on what/how much was eaten. If a child is new or anxious, we prioritize calm, unhurried mealtimes and familiar “safe” foods where possible.\n\n3) Separation anxiety / big transitions\nWe lean heavily on the key-person approach, predictable routines, and co-regulation. Practical supports include:\n• Staggered start/shorter initial days if needed\n• Consistent handover (same adult, same spot, same goodbye)\n• Comfort objects and “family photo” in the child’s bag/cubby\n• Quick reassurance updates to you during the early separations (so you’re not left worrying)\nIf anxiety is persistent, we agree a joint plan with you (what to say at goodbye, timing, and how we respond) and review it frequently.\n\nStart dates / constraints this term\nAt the moment, I don’t anticipate a major constraint, but start dates can tighten quickly depending on confirmations. If you share (a) your child’s age and (b) your ideal start date and schedule (full days/part-time), I can tell you the most realistic options.\n\nIf Nursery_E is genuinely in your top set, I’d encourage you to apply soon—an application lets us plan a place and a smooth settling-in timeline around your preferred start date.",
