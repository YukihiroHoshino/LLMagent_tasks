Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet activities (books, puzzles) so the room stays restful.\n- **Adjustment flexibility:** We’re used to children taking time.

We can do this via an app/message system and/or paper depending on your preference.\n- **Ongoing:** you can message us for quick check-ins, and we’ll flag anything important the same day.\n- **Meetings:** scheduled **parent-teacher check-ins** during the year (and anytime by request), plus a settling-in review after the first couple of weeks.\n\nIf you share (a) your child’s **age**, (b) whether they **nap currently**, and (c) anything that typically helps them settle (comfort item, routine, sensitivities), I can tell you how we’d tailor the first two weeks.\n\nAlso, since we have limited capacity, if Nursery_E is becoming a serious option for you, you’re welcome to move from exploring to an **application** when ready—no pressure, but earlier is better if you want to be considered for our available spot.",

We’ll help you script this so it’s repeatable.\n- A **primary point-person teacher** checks in closely during the first 2–3 weeks (sleep, eating, comfort strategies, what’s working/not working).\n- We use comfort supports (favorite item where appropriate, family photo, calming corner, sensory tools) and we never “force” separation—we focus on **co-regulation** and building security.\n\n3) **Communication with parents**\n- **Daily touchpoint at pick-up** (quick recap of mood, meals, nap/rest, highlights).\n- For younger children/new starters, we can provide **more frequent early updates** during the first week(s) so you’re not wondering how things are going.\n- We also do periodic **check-ins** (especially after the settling-in period) to align on routines and developmental goals. Photos/notes are shared in line with our privacy policy and family preferences.\n\n**Visit / open house**\nI’d love to get you scheduled. I can offer a short visit/tour:\n- **Tue 9:30–10:00**\n- **Wed 1:30–2:00**\n- **Fri 9:30–10:00**\nIf you tell me which slot works best (or share two alternative windows), I’ll confirm.\n\nIf Nursery_C is feeling like it may be the right fit, you’re also welcome to submit an **application**—it helps us plan proactively for your start timeline while you complete your final decision.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor the visit: your child’s **age** and whether they’ve experienced **group care** before?",

If Nursery_C is feeling like a strong fit, you’re also welcome to **apply**—that’s the best way for us to keep you in active consideration while you finish comparing options.",
