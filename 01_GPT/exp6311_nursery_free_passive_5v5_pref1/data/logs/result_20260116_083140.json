A typical day includes: warm welcome/free-play learning centers → short circle time (songs, stories, language) → small-group activities (early literacy/numeracy foundations, art/sensory, fine-motor) → outdoor time daily → lunch → calm rest/quiet period → afternoon project/play and pick-up. We balance child-led exploration with gentle structure and lots of social-emotional coaching.\n\n(2) Biggest strengths of Nursery_C:\n- Consistent routines + warm transitions (helps children settle and build independence)\n- Close observation of each child to tailor activities and support communication/social skills\n- Strong family partnership—clear communication and practical guidance for home routines\n- Daily outdoor time and hands-on learning\n\n(3) Timeline/criteria for offering our remaining spot: We’re rolling. If you apply, we aim to schedule a brief family chat/visit quickly and confirm a decision shortly after. We look for overall fit with our approach and age group, readiness for group routines (with appropriate support), and alignment/communication with the family on expectations (sleep/rest, transitions, independence, etc.), plus practical enrollment needs (start date/schedule).\n\nIf you’re potentially ready to apply soon, could you share: your child’s age, ideal start date, and the schedule you need (full/part-time)?
