The day usually includes a warm welcome/settling time, free-play learning centers (blocks, pretend play, art, books), a short group circle (songs/stories), outdoor play, lunch, rest/quiet time, and afternoon small-group activities.\n\nApproach to early learning: We focus on play-based, age-appropriate learning that builds language, early numeracy through games, social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, naming feelings), and independence (self-care routines). We observe children closely and plan activities that match their current interests and developmental stage.\n\nSupporting new children settling in: We use a gradual transition where possible—short initial stays that lengthen over time, a consistent key staff member to build trust, and a familiar routine so children know what to expect. We also keep close communication with families during the first weeks (brief daily updates and check-ins) and use comfort objects/strategies that work at home.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what is your child’s age and temperament (e.g., cautious vs. eager-to-join), and are there any specific routines or needs we should know about?

Since all nurseries share the same priority order (A highest, E lowest), my acceptance chances are weakest everywhere, so I should avoid locking into a low-ranked option too early. I already opened a TALK with Nursery_C last round; in round 2 I should continue gathering info and signal interest without applying, while I try to pursue higher-ranked nurseries in other rounds."
