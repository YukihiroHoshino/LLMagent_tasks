Early “great performance” = clear milestones in the first 2 weeks, predictable execution, and a first meaningful release/impact by ~day 60–90.\n\n2) Process + stakeholder alignment: tighten the operating cadence with key partners (regular updates, crisp decision logs, and risk management). Early “great performance” = fewer surprises, faster decisions, and stakeholders reporting improved clarity/velocity.\n\nTo tailor this: could you share a quick snapshot of (a) the 2–3 strengths you lean on most, (b) the kinds of projects you do best (0→1, scaling, turnaround, cross-functional delivery, etc.), and (c) what you’d need to see from us to feel confident applying here versus your other options?",
