When conflicts arise, we coach children through repairing (checking in, apologizing, making a plan).\n\n(3) Core hours + extended care\n- Core day is typically 8:30–15:30 with drop-off/pickup windows.\n- Extended-care options depend on demand and staffing; if you tell me your needed drop-off/pick-up times, I can confirm what we can accommodate (and whether it would be guaranteed or “as available”).\n\nApplying later: key steps/dates\n- The main “key date” is simply capacity—once our single remaining place is filled, we can only offer a waitlist.\n- If you choose to apply in a later round, the steps are: confirm start month + schedule needs, submit the application, and we schedule a short family meeting/visit (and, if applicable, a settling-in plan).\n\nTwo quick questions so I can be precise about fit and availability: (a) your child’s age and desired start month, and (b) the exact hours you need (including any early/late care)?",

Children tend to thrive with the steady flow and clear transitions.\n- Play-based learning with gentle structure: educators set up rich centers (language, early numeracy through games, art/sensory, construction, music/movement) and extend learning through prompts, vocabulary, and small-group moments—without pushing a “worksheet” model.\n- Outdoor time: we aim for a meaningful outdoor block daily; if weather prevents it, we substitute indoor gross-motor activities.\n- Social-emotional development: we explicitly coach turn-taking, emotion naming, conflict repair, and independence through routines (tidying, self-serve when possible, toileting/handwashing habits).\n- Communication with families: brief daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up plus regular updates (what we worked on, notable moments, and any support needs). We’re also responsive by message/email for quick check-ins.\n\nTimeline / how best to proceed this round\n- We can make an offer as soon as you submit an application and we confirm fit (age/start month/schedule) while our single remaining place is still open.\n- Because capacity is tight, if Nursery_D is a serious option for you, the best way to keep it available is to apply in the round you’re ready—otherwise we may only be able to offer a waitlist later.\n\nTo guide you accurately, could you tell me:\n1) your child’s age and desired start month, and\n2) the hours you need (including any early/late care needs)?\nIf those align, I can tell you immediately what availability looks like and what the next step would be if you choose to apply this round.",
