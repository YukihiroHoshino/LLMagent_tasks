Early on, you’d own a core project area with direct visibility—typically something that’s already a priority for leadership and has clear success metrics.\n\nTo tailor this: what type of role are you targeting (e.g., backend, full-stack, data, product/ops), and what’s one example of a project where you delivered impact quickly? If what I described aligns, I’d love to discuss a concrete 90-day plan specific to your strengths.",
