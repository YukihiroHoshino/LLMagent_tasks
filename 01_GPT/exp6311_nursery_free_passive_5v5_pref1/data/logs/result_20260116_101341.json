We rotate between child-choice and small-group guided activities.\n- Outdoor time: weather permitting, we aim for a substantial outdoor block daily (often supplemented with a second shorter outdoor/play movement time).\n- Lunch/rest/quiet time, then afternoon: calmer small-group options + outdoor/gross-motor play\nOverall, we lean play-based with gentle structure—enough routine for security, but not overly rigid.\n\n2) Ratios, staffing, and continuity\n- We stay within required caregiver-to-child ratio standards and typically organize the day so children are in consistent small groups.\n- We prioritize staff continuity: children are supported by a stable set of caregivers, and we plan coverage to minimize “new face” transitions during key parts of the day (arrival, meals, outdoor, pickup).\n\n3) Social-emotional development & transitions\n- We use predictable routines, visual/verbal cues, and advance warnings (“in 5 minutes we’ll tidy up…”) to make transitions smoother.\n- Caregivers actively coach skills like turn-taking, labeling feelings, and simple conflict resolution (e.g., offering scripts: “I’m using this—can I have a turn next?”).\n- For new starts, we focus on attachment and gradual settling: consistent caregiver, clear goodbye routine, and regular parent communication so we can adjust supports quickly.\n\nTo help us decide next steps efficiently: what age is your child, and what are your top 2 priorities (e.g., lots of outdoor time, calmer environment, more structure, flexibility)?

Here’s the information you asked for:\n\n1) Current caregiver-to-child ratios (by age group)\n- We staff within required local standards and keep children in consistent small groups.\n- Because ratios can shift slightly with attendance and staffing (and can differ by room/age mix), I don’t want to quote a number that could be misleading in a message. If you share your child’s age (or age range), I can confirm the typical ratio for that room and what you should expect day-to-day.\n\n2) Typical daily schedule (outdoor vs. structured)\n- Arrival & settling-in: warm handoff + child-led free play\n- Short circle: songs/story (brief, age-appropriate)\n- Morning activity block: mostly play-based centers (art/sensory/building/early language & number concepts through play) with optional small-group guided activities\n- Outdoor time: weather permitting, we aim for a substantial outdoor block daily (often with an additional shorter movement/outdoor play period)\n- Lunch + rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon: calmer small-group options + outdoor/gross-motor play + pickup\nOverall, we’re play-based with predictable routines—enough structure for security, not overly rigid.\n\n3) Settling-in / transition support for new children\n- Gradual start when possible (shorter initial days or a phased schedule, based on the child)\n- Consistent primary caregivers in the early weeks to build attachment and predictability\n- Clear goodbye routine and caregiver coaching for parents on what tends to help (short, consistent handoff)\n- Transition cues throughout the day (warnings, songs, visual/verbal prompts) and comfort strategies tailored to the child\n- Frequent parent communication early on so we can adjust quickly if separation or transitions are hard\n\nTwo quick questions so I can be precise and we can move efficiently if you’re close to deciding:\n1) How old is your child (or expected start age)?\n2) If Nursery_D feels like a fit, would you be ready to apply as early as next round, or are you still waiting to hear back from a higher-choice option?\n\n[TALK]",
