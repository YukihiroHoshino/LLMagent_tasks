Because it’s our only place, we recommend applying as soon as you feel it’s a fit. **We can hold the place only until the end of this round** once an application is submitted, since matches can finalize quickly.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s age and your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (standard vs. extended care), I can confirm the best classroom placement and whether extended hours would be available.

Teachers model calm conflict-resolution and help children practice communication and independence.\n\nTo help you time this well: **where does Nursery_D sit on your list right now (top choice vs. backup), and when would you be ready to submit an application if you decide to move forward?**",

If you tell me your child’s age, I can share the typical classroom staffing pattern you’d be in.\n\nOutdoor play & learning:\nOutdoor time is a daily priority (weather permitting). We use the outdoors for both free play (gross motor, social play) and guided activities (nature observation, simple games, movement, and “learning through exploration”).\n\nCore hours & after-care flexibility:\nWe run a full-day program with morning drop-off and afternoon pickup windows, and we can often accommodate extended care on request depending on staffing and demand.
