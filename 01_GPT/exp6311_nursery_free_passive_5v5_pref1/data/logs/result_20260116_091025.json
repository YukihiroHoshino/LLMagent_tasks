We emphasize gentle routines, positive guidance, and strong home–school communication.\n\n**Hours:** We operate standard weekday nursery hours with morning and afternoon pick-up windows; if you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up times, I can confirm how well we can accommodate.\n\n**Best fit for families:** Nursery_C tends to be a great fit for families who value a nurturing environment, consistent routines, and a collaborative relationship with educators—especially if you’re looking for steady social-emotional development alongside early learning through play.\n\n**Availability this cycle:** We do anticipate being able to offer a place, and I want to be transparent that we’re very interested in families who see Nursery_C as a strong option. If Nursery_C is high on your list, I’d encourage you to submit an application when you’re ready—I'd be glad to learn a bit about your child’s age, temperament, and any schedule needs so we can confirm fit.\n\nWhat hours do you need, and what kind of environment helps your child thrive (more energetic/active vs. quieter/structured)?",

Exact ratios can vary by age group and time of day; if you share your child’s age, I can give the most accurate picture for that classroom.\n- **Drop-off:** We use a calm, predictable handoff routine (greeting at the door, quick parent goodbye, child chooses a settling activity). We support separation with consistency and a warm but firm “goodbye plan,” and we’ll coordinate with you on what language/routine works best.\n- **Naps/rest:** We treat rest as a transition, not a “switch.” We do a wind-down routine (quiet activity, dim lights, soothing music/story). Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet rest options so the room stays calm.\n\n2) **Social-emotional development & conflict resolution**\n- We proactively teach skills like naming feelings, turn-taking, waiting, and asking for help through stories, role-play, and daily routines.\n- In conflicts, teachers stay close and coach in-the-moment: we help children **label emotions**, **state the problem**, and **practice solutions** (e.g., trade, take turns with a timer, choose another activity). We keep it developmentally appropriate—more modeling for younger children, more guided problem-solving for older children.\n- We reinforce positive behavior by noticing specific actions (“You offered a turn—that was kind”) and we follow consistent classroom expectations.\n\n3) **Communication with parents (daily updates, app, meetings)**\n- **Daily communication:** Brief check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when possible, plus a daily summary of key items (mood, meals, nap/rest, highlights).\n- **Ongoing updates:** We share photos/notes and classroom updates regularly; we can also align on your preference (quick messages vs. scheduled touchpoints).\n- **Meetings:** We offer scheduled conferences and are available for additional meetings if something comes up (transition challenges, social dynamics, development questions).\n\nTo help you assess fit: **how old is your child, and what’s your biggest priority right now** (smooth drop-off, nap support, social confidence, language development, etc.)?

If anything is missing, we may ask one quick follow-up before confirming.\n\nQuick summary (as requested)\n- Ratio / group size: typically ~1:6 staffing; group size around ~12 children, with two educators present for most core parts of the day.\n- Day-to-day communication: brief daily written notes on meals/rest plus a short highlight; periodic photos/activity/theme updates; and scheduled parent-teacher check-ins (with ad-hoc coordination at drop-off/pick-up as needed).\n\nCall/visit this week\nYes—we can do a quick 10–15 minute call or a short visit. Please share 2–3 time windows that work for you (and your preferred day), and I’ll confirm a slot.\n\nTo help us move quickly if you decide to apply: what start date and weekly schedule are you aiming for (days/hours), and are there any non-negotiables (e.g., latest pickup time)?\n\n[TALK]",
