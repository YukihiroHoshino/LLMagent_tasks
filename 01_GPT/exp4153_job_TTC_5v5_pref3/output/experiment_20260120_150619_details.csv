At Company_C, I am ranked #1 in priority, so applying there guarantees a direct closed loop (Company_C identifies me) in the first step unless Company_C is removed earlier—which it cannot be, because it will identify me whenever I am available. In contrast, at Company_D I am only #3 (behind Seeker_D and Seeker_E), and at Company_A and Company_B I am last/near-last, making acceptance unlikely. Therefore, to maximize my outcome, I should rank Company_C first; after that, keep the remaining firms in my true preference order as fallbacks.",False,Company_C,False,False,4

Company_B ranks me 1st, but multiple seekers (A/E) rank B highly, so it may be contested; still it is my next-best remaining option.
