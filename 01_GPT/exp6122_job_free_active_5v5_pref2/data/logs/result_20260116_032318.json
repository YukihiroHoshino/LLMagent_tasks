Market-wide preferences indicate Seeker_B ranks Company_C 2nd (good), Seeker_C ranks us 2nd, while Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank us last, making them very unlikely. Our top choice Seeker_B is likely to be pursued by Company_A (top priority) and Company_E (2nd priority) and prefers Company_E over us, so we may not land Seeker_B. Given Seeker_E has us as #1 and has provided strong, directly relevant examples, keeping them warm is beneficial while we attempt to attract Seeker_B (and possibly Seeker_C though they are last on our list). Therefore continue TALK, state near-term timeline, and ask for a quick confirm/availability while we finalize."

Only Seeker_E contacted us this round, and they have shown strong alignment, specificity, and immediate availability. However, Seeker_E is our 4th choice; we should avoid committing if there is a realistic path to match with higher-priority seekers. Looking at seeker preferences: Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 (after Company_E), Seeker_C ranks Company_C #2 (after Company_D), while Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C last. So the most plausible higher-priority upgrade is Seeker_B (top for us) if they fail to secure Company_E. Company_E’s top priority is Seeker_E, so Company_E may take Seeker_E if they apply; that could remove Seeker_E from our pool. Still, we can keep Seeker_E warm via [TALK] and encourage an [APPLY] soon while we wait 1–2 rounds for Seeker_B. Since Seeker_E is currently only [TALK], we cannot accept anyway; we should request they formally apply and set an explicit decision timeline, while signaling they are a finalist but not yet committed."
