We have repeatedly rejected Seeker_E to keep the slot open for higher-priority candidates. However, by round 6 we are still unmatched and only Seeker_E is contacting us; other higher-priority seekers likely matched elsewhere (Seeker_B prefers Company_E then Company_C; if Company_E accepted Seeker_B, we won’t see them; Seeker_A ranks Company_C last; Seeker_D ranks Company_C last; Seeker_C ranks Company_C second but may be with Company_D). Given the environment’s 30-round limit, continuing to reject risks ending unmatched. Since Seeker_E is on our acceptable list and is highly committed to Company_C, accepting now secures a filled position within quota."
