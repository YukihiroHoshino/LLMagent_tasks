The specific mechanism I used was a short written RFC (2–3 pages) that (a) defined a single “source-of-truth” metric and owner (cycle time + SLA attainment, owned by Ops with Product sign-off), (b) proposed 2–3 options with explicit tradeoffs, and (c) set a decision deadline. I then ran a weekly decision forum with the key leads where we reviewed the metric, resolved open questions, and made “disagree-and-commit” calls; anything blocked beyond 48 hours went through a pre-agreed escalation path to the exec sponsor.\n\n2) 30/60/90-day plan + weeks 1–2 deliverables:\nWeeks 1–2 deliverables (what I would produce immediately):\n- A one-page initiative brief: problem statement, target outcome, non-goals, constraints, and initial success metrics.\n- Stakeholder map + RACI (single accountable owner per metric/decision area).\n- A baseline metrics snapshot + instrumentation gaps.\n- A prioritized issue/opportunity backlog with a 2–4 week “first win” plan.\n- Operating cadence: weekly exec/stakeholder readout, decision log, and risk register.\n\n30 days: Align on the “north star” metric + guardrails, validate root causes via stakeholder/user discovery, and deliver at least one early measurable improvement (even if narrow) while locking in the operating cadence.\n\n60 days: Execute the main workstream(s) with clear milestones, tighten cross-team handoffs, and show sustained movement in the core metric(s) with documented learnings and updated plan.\n\n90 days: Land the larger milestone(s), institutionalize the process (ownership, dashboards, playbooks), and hand off/scale with a roadmap for the next phase.\n\nI’m available for a 15–20 minute call this week and can move quickly.

I’d choose a single primary action that is (a) achievable within the first session/day, (b) strongly predictive of downstream activation, and (c) unambiguous in instrumentation.\n- “Activated”: a higher-confidence state that indicates the user has reached sustained/meaningful usage—typically a combination of (a) completing the first key action and (b) hitting a usage threshold within a time window (e.g., 2–3 meaningful actions, or returning usage, within 14 days), potentially with an account-level component if collaboration is core.\n- Explicit exclusions (for both): purely passive events (page views), vanity steps (signup/login), auto-triggered/system events, and “setup complete” steps that don’t correlate with value (unless data shows they’re truly predictive).\n\n2) Week-1 ops/comms-led intervention (no eng), what I’d measure, and decision rule:\n- Intervention: a targeted “activation concierge” program for the highest-drop segment (e.g., specific acquisition channel/persona). This includes a 3-touch sequence over 5 days (welcome + 1-minute quickstart, a checklist tailored to the persona, and an office-hours/CS-assisted offer), plus a lightweight internal SLA so any replies get action within 24 hours.\n- What I’d measure: 48–72 hour first-key-action rate, median time-to-first-key-action, reply/engagement rate to the sequence, and downstream 14-day activation (as it matures). I’d also tag reasons for non-completion from CS notes.\n- Decision based on result: if we see a meaningful lift in 48–72 hour first-key-action (e.g., +X pp vs. control/baseline) with manageable ops cost, we scale the playbook and codify it; if lift is minimal but responses indicate a consistent friction point, we convert that into a prioritized backlog item (instrumentation fix, UX copy change, or small product tweak) and run a second iteration focused on the identified blocker.\n\nLooking forward to speaking Wednesday.\n\nSincerely,\nSeeker_E",

If volume is very low, I’d treat week 1 as signal-gathering and focus on qualitative reasons + leading indicators rather than declaring a win.\n\n2) Baseline/control comparison without perfect tooling:\n- Best option: a lightweight holdout within the same segment (e.g., 80% receive concierge touches, 20% holdout) using a deterministic rule (e.g., hash of account ID or alternating days) to avoid selection bias.\n- If holdout is not feasible immediately: use a matched segment comparison (same channel/persona/plan tier) from the immediately preceding cohort/week, while controlling for any major launch/campaign changes.\n- I’d also track “engagement with the intervention” (reply rate, attendance at office hours) to help interpret outcomes if the funnel metric is noisy early.\n\nLooking forward to speaking Wed 14:30–14:50 ET.\n\nSincerely,\nSeeker_E",
