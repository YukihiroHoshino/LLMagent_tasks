In this round my only inbound is Seeker_C, and accepting now secures a strong match within quota. Holding out for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_E and Company_B ahead of Company_D, so they may never apply to us. Given the one-position quota and the high likelihood of a stable match with Seeker_C, accepting maximizes expected outcome versus waiting."

In this round, I received APPLY from Seeker_B, Seeker_A, and Seeker_D; Seeker_E did not contact me and in their preferences Company_E is last, making it unlikely I can secure my top choice later. Seeker_B has Company_E as their #1 choice, so accepting now likely locks in a high-priority match and avoids risking losing Seeker_B to another company in subsequent rounds. With quota 1, I should accept Seeker_B rather than hold out for an unlikely Seeker_E."

In round 1, only Seeker_E has applied to us, but higher-priority candidates (especially Seeker_B and Seeker_A) may still be available and could apply later; however, Seeker_B ranks us #2 and may be pulled by Company_E (#1) or others, and Seeker_A ranks us last, making them unlikely to apply. Seeker_D ranks us last as well. Seeker_C ranks us #2 but is last on our list. Seeker_E ranks us #1, so accepting now likely secures a match and avoids ending unfilled. Given uncertainty that higher-priority seekers will come to us, accepting Seeker_E is a safe, quota-filling choice."
