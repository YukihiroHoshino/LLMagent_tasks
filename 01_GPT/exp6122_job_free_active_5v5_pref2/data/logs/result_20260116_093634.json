I owned the end-to-end plan (requirements, milestones, risk tracking), ran weekly stakeholder syncs, and kept scope aligned to delivery constraints. Result: shipped on schedule and improved the key workflow conversion by ~12% within the first month.\n\n2) Ownership in ambiguity: I was asked to “reduce churn” without a clear problem statement. I defined the hypothesis set, instrumented the funnel, and prioritized the top 2 drivers with the team. Result: reduced 30-day churn by ~8% over one quarter through targeted onboarding and lifecycle improvements.\n\n3) Metrics-driven communication: I built a simple KPI dashboard + narrative updates for exec/stakeholders (what changed, why, what we’re doing next). Result: cut ad-hoc status requests substantially and accelerated decision-making; we moved from weekly debates to clear metric-based prioritization and shipped 2 additional iterations in the same quarter.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a 1-page write-up with the exact metrics, baselines, and the decision log.

Per your note, I’m submitting the requested short work sample as my updated application this round.\n\n30/60/90 Plan (assumptions OK)\n\nFirst 2 weeks — Instrument/measure\n1) Baseline the funnel + operating cadence: map the end-to-end workflow (acquisition → activation → core action → retention) and confirm event taxonomy with Eng/Data.\n2) Stand up a lightweight KPI dashboard (daily/weekly) and a decision log so changes tie to measurable outcomes.\n3) Customer/partner signal: 8–10 stakeholder interviews (Product, Eng, Support/Sales) + 5–8 user calls to validate top pain points.\n\nKPIs (3–5) + what “good” looks like\n1) Activation rate (new users reaching core value within X days): +10–15% relative improvement by day 60.\n2) Time-to-value (median time to first core action): -20% by day 60.\n3) Week-4 retention (or 30-day churn inverse): +5–8% by day 90.\n4) Core workflow conversion (key step completion): +8–12% by day 90.\n5) Execution health (on-time delivery of committed milestones): ≥90% by day 60 onward.\n\nTop 3 risks to de-risk\n1) Metrics/data integrity risk: instrumentation gaps or inconsistent definitions. Mitigation: metric spec doc + event audits + single source of truth dashboard.\n2) Cross-functional misalignment risk: competing priorities across Product/Eng/Go-to-market. Mitigation: weekly operating review, clear owners, explicit tradeoffs, and a scoped roadmap with success metrics.\n3) Shipping risk (scope creep/latency): ambiguous asks ballooning. Mitigation: tight problem statements, staged experiments, and 2-week execution increments with exit criteria.\n\nExample: turning an ambiguous problem into a scoped execution plan\nAmbiguous prompt: “Improve retention.”\n1) Clarify outcome + segment: choose primary cohort (e.g., new users first 30 days) and define retention metric.\n2) Diagnose: instrument funnel + cohort analysis to find top drop-off points; pair with qualitative call themes.\n3) Hypotheses: pick top 2 drivers (e.g., confusing onboarding step + missing ‘aha’ moment).\n4) Plan: two parallel tracks—(a) onboarding simplification experiment (A/B), (b) in-product guidance/triggered lifecycle messages.\n5) Success criteria: activation + time-to-value improvements within 2–4 weeks; retention lift by week 8–12.\n6) Execution: write PRD, align Eng estimates, ship in increments, report weekly with decisions tied to KPI movement.\n\nIf this meets the bar, I can commit immediately and start quickly.
