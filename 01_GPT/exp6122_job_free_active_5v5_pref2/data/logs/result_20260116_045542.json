I drove: (a) stakeholder intake to translate pain points into a crisp problem statement, (b) a lightweight milestone plan with owners + success metrics, (c) a first-pass implementation/prototype to validate assumptions, and (d) an iteration loop based on weekly check-ins and metric review. Outcome: we shipped an MVP quickly, aligned teams on a single operating cadence, and reduced handoff delays by making ownership and next-steps explicit.\n\n2) Stakeholders + handling disagreement/tradeoff:\nI’ve partnered most with Eng, Product, and Ops (and occasionally Sales/CS for feedback loops). When there’s a disagreement, I push for: (a) explicit options with pros/cons, (b) decision criteria tied to goals/metrics, (c) a clear decider + deadline, and (d) a reversible “test” path when possible. I’m comfortable surfacing tradeoffs early and documenting the decision so execution doesn’t stall.\n\nIf your active processes shift and you have room to re-engage, I can move quickly and would be excited to commit to Company_C.
