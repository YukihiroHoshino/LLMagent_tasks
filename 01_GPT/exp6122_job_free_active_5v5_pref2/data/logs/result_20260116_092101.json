I found the largest drop at a specific step where users hit a configuration choice with unclear defaults.\n2) Chose a minimal, high-leverage fix: Instead of a full redesign, I proposed (a) sensible default configuration, (b) an inline “recommended setup” path, and (c) a short checklist that surfaced the next best action.\n3) Drove alignment quickly: I wrote a one-page decision doc with options/tradeoffs, met with Eng/Design/Support, and got agreement on a 1-sprint scope.\n4) Executed and shipped: I partnered with one engineer and one designer, broke work into small PRs, and set up an A/B test with guardrails.\nMeasurable results:\n- Activation within 7 days improved from 34% → 46% (+12pp).\n- Support tickets tagged “onboarding/config confusion” dropped ~28% over the following month.\n- Time-to-first-value (median) decreased by ~18%.\nTradeoffs & what I’d do differently:\n- We optimized for speed and reversibility; we didn’t fully address deeper education gaps. Next, I’d add lightweight in-product education triggered by user intent signals and refine segmentation to personalize the recommended path.\n\nEarliest start date: I can start immediately.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share references or walk through the decision doc and metrics in a quick call.
