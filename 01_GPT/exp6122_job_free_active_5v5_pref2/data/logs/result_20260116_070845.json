I’m comfortable taking a narrower initial scope (or a short trial/project) and can start immediately.\n\nGiven where things stand this round, is there any realistic scenario in which you’d consider me if your top options don’t materialize—and if so, what would you need from me to be ready to move to an offer fast?",
