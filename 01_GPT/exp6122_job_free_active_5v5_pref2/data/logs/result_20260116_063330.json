Result: reduced time-to-first-success by ~25% and lifted activation conversion by ~8% over the following month, while cutting related support tickets.\n\n2) Where I’d be strongest immediately: (a) execution/process + delivery.

If logs only have user_id, I need a reliable users(user_id→account_id) mapping.\n• **run_id**: strongly preferred for linking run_triggered → run_completed/run_failed.\n  - If run_id is missing in logs: my preferred workaround is to anchor completion from the **DB runs table** (runs.account_id, runs.created_at, runs.status, runs.completed_at) and treat “triggered” as a weaker proxy (route hit) without attempting per-run linkage. If DB is also missing, next-best is a fingerprint: (account_id + route + normalized payload fields like project_id/config_id) + short time window, but I’d label it “low-confidence.”\n• **import_id**: preferred for import_start → import_completed. Workaround if missing: rely on **DB imports table** keyed by (account_id, created_at, status, completed_at), and compute “first completed import” per account.\n• **project_id (or core_entity_id)**: helpful but not strictly required if we can compute core_entity_created from DB (MIN(projects.created_at) per account). If only logs exist and project_id is missing, we can still timestamp core_entity_created at the first POST /projects (2xx), but it’s less auditable.\n\nIn short: for week-1 stability, the minimum viable set is **account_id + (runs table with status/completed_at)**; run_id/import_id make it cleaner and enable tighter linkage.\n\n2) Proxy window (N minutes)\nI’d start with **N = 30 minutes** for “first successful run” because it’s usually long enough to cover queueing + execution for first-time users, but short enough to avoid counting unrelated later successes.\n• I’d sanity-check by looking at the p50/p90 of (run_triggered → run_completed_success) where completion exists; then set N ≈ p90 rounded up (often 30, sometimes 60).\n• If segment-dependent behavior is obvious (e.g., enterprise runs are heavier), I’d keep one global N initially (30) for comparability, then optionally add a second metric: **proxy_success_60m** for heavy segments, clearly labeled.\n\nIf you share whether runs/imports are persisted in DB today (and what fields exist), I can tighten the exact SQL to match your schema in one pass.\n\nPer your process I’ll stay in [TALK] and am ready to convert to formal [APPLY] immediately if you send the go after your outreach cycle.",

Immediate start works well on our side.\n\nOn comp: to keep this efficient, for this role we’re hiring at **[Level placeholder]** with a total comp band of **$X–$Y** (base + bonus, plus equity on top depending on level). If that’s broadly in line with what you had in mind, please confirm and also share your preferred mix (more base vs more equity).\n\nProcess update: we’re completing this final outreach cycle to a couple candidates who are higher on our internal priority order. I’ll send you a clear **go/no-go next round**. If it’s a go, I’ll ask you to submit **[APPLY] immediately** and we’ll move straight to a decision.\n\n[TALK]",

Only Seeker_E is in our inbox this round and they are engaged, aligned, and ready to start. However, Seeker_E is 4th on our priority list; we should keep them warm while we attempt to secure a higher-priority candidate (B/A/D). Also, Seeker_E has not submitted an [APPLY] this round, so we cannot accept; we should respond with [TALK], confirm alignment on comp/start, share our budget band/level, and set a clear next-step/go-no-go timeline to avoid losing them if higher-priority outreach fails."
