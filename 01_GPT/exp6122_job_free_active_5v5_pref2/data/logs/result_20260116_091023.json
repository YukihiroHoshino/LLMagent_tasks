That keeps the metric unambiguous and harder to game.\n- If you believe there are **multiple equivalent “first value” paths** (e.g., `first_success_completed` OR `first_success_shared`), I’d define a **composite FVE set** *only if* both are validated as meaningful value and are of similar “difficulty.” Concretely:\n  - **Primary metric remains A2FV-48 to “Any Valid FVE”**, where `any_valid_fve = MIN(timestamp of {FVE events})` within 48h.\n  - **Anti-gaming controls:**\n    1) Maintain a **hierarchy**: keep reporting **A2FV-48 to `first_success_completed`** as a secondary “gold” metric even if we use a composite primary. If composite improves but `first_success_completed` doesn’t, that’s a red flag.\n    2) Add a **quality guardrail** tied to real value, e.g., **D7 retention**, **repeat success within 7 days**, or “second success” rate. If we “game” by nudging users into a low-value shortcut, these won’t improve.\n    3) Pre-register the definition: lock the event set + properties up front in the Day-1 Metric Brief (no changing the goalposts mid-iteration).\n\n2) **Attribution without A/B tooling (staged rollout approach)**\nIf we rely on staged rollouts, my concrete approach is:\n- **Step 0: Instrument + segmentability** (Day 1–2): ensure we can segment by **platform, app version, geo, acquisition channel, and exposure** (at minimum: “new flow enabled” flag).\n- **Primary method: Difference-in-differences (DiD) using rollout boundaries**\n  - Roll out the change to a **clearly defined treatment slice** first (e.g., Android only, or a subset of geos, or a % rollout keyed by user_id) while keeping a comparable slice as control.\n  - Compute: (post–pre change in treatment) − (post–pre change in control) for A2FV-48, with the same guardrails.\n  - Use **platform/app version** as a natural boundary when feasible (e.g., new version contains the change; older version acts as control during the adoption ramp).\n- **Control for channel/seasonality**\n  - Report DiD **within acquisition channels** (or reweight to a fixed channel mix) so shifts in paid/organic don’t masquerade as product lift.\n  - If geo is stable, prefer a **geo holdout** (or staggered geo rollout) to reduce contamination.\n- **Robustness checks**\n  - **Pre-trend check**: verify treatment vs control were moving similarly before the change.\n  - **Sensitivity**: run the analysis excluding launch day(s), and by major device/OS cohorts.\n  - If needed, a light **synthetic control**: build a weighted control from multiple unaffected slices to best match the treatment’s pre-period.\n\nIf you tell me which rollout lever you actually have (platform-only, geo, % feature flag, or app-version-based), I’ll pick the cleanest identification strategy and specify the exact treatment/control slices in the Day-1 brief.\n\n[TALK]",

              "message": "Hi Seeker_E—thank you for the formal application. We’re ready to move forward and would like to extend an offer to join Company_C.\n\nNext step: we’ll align on Day 1 around the A2FV-48 Metric Brief (primary + guardrails), confirm the canonical `first_success_completed` definition and anti-gaming checks, and set treatment/control slices using our app-version rollout so we can run a clean DiD readout.\n\nWelcome aboard—excited to work together.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Company_C’s true priority list is [Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_C]. Seeker_E is ranked 4th, but is the only candidate in the inbox this round and we still have quota=1 with no matches yet. Given the round is already 11 and there is no active application from higher-priority seekers to Company_C at this moment, rejecting risks ending unmatched or being forced later into a worse outcome. Seeker_E has also provided strong, highly aligned evidence of fit and is explicitly committed; their preferences place Company_C as #1, reducing risk of them matching elsewhere if accepted. Accepting now secures a fill with an in-list candidate and likely stable match."
