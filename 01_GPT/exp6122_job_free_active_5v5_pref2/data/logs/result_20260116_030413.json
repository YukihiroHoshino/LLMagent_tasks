Since Seeker_B is my #2 overall and is applying now, accepting secures a high-priority match immediately. Waiting risks losing Seeker_B to other firms (though Seeker_B ranks Company_E #1, they could still proceed elsewhere if rejected/delayed), and there is no current signal that Seeker_E will apply to Company_E soon (Seeker_E ranks Company_E last).
