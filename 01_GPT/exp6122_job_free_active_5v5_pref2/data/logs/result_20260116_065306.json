I know you’ve been prioritizing higher-ranked candidates, but since you’re still unmatched this round, I’d like to formally apply again and make this easy to close if your top options haven’t committed.\n\nCompany_C remains my #1 choice. I can start immediately, have no constraints, and I’m ready to accept and commit right away. I bring end-to-end ownership on ambiguous work, data-driven process improvement, and clear stakeholder communication with reliable follow-through.\n\nIf your higher-priority candidates are still undecided, I’d be grateful to be your “ready now” option for this opening—if you’re willing to extend an offer this round, I will accept immediately.",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched and it is my #1 true preference. Past rejections were priority-driven, so the best move is to apply again with a crisp, commitment-forward message that reduces their risk: immediate start, strong fit, and a clear deadline to decide. I’ll also acknowledge their priority list and position myself as the ready-to-close option if their higher-priority candidates haven’t finalized."

At this time, we’re still holding our remaining opening for candidates who are higher on our internal priority list, so we won’t be able to extend an offer this round.\n\nIf our higher-priority options don’t materialize in the next round(s), we may reopen consideration quickly given your strong fit and availability. Thank you again for your persistence and time.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and remain unmatched. Our true priority list ranks Seeker_E 4th (behind Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). In round 6, only Seeker_E contacted us; no higher-priority candidates are in the inbox. However, market-wide, Seeker_B ranks Company_C #2 and may still be available; Seeker_A ranks us last; Seeker_D ranks us last. Company_E and Company_D are highly attractive to many seekers, so Seeker_B may continue pursuing Company_E first, leaving a chance they approach us later. Accepting Seeker_E now would secure a match but risks missing a higher-priority candidate (especially Seeker_B) in subsequent rounds. Given we’ve repeatedly communicated we’re holding for higher-priority candidates and we still have remaining rounds, the strategy to maximize our match quality is to reject again and keep the slot open, unless we believe the probability of landing Seeker_B (or Seeker_A/D) has become negligible. With no new signal that top candidates are off the market, we continue to hold."
