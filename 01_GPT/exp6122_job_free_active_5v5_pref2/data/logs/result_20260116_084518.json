I’m specifically looking for a role where I can take responsibility for execution and drive outcomes end-to-end.\n\nWhat I’d deliver in the first 30–60 days:\n- Week 1–2: ramp on goals/metrics, map stakeholders, identify the highest-leverage backlog.\n- Weeks 3–6: own and ship 1–2 concrete deliverables, set a simple execution cadence, and communicate progress clearly.\n- By day 60: demonstrate measurable impact and a repeatable process for ongoing delivery.\n\nIf it’s helpful, I can send a short written work sample and references today, or do a 15-minute call this round.

Sharing the items you requested so you can move quickly if you’re still unfilled.\n\n(1) Short written work sample (project write-up):\nTitle: Cross-functional launch to improve execution throughput\n- Context: Multiple teams had unclear ownership and inconsistent status reporting, leading to slipped timelines and rework.\n- My role: Owned end-to-end delivery (requirements → plan → execution → launch), aligned stakeholders, set milestones/owners, and ran a weekly execution cadence.\n- What I did: Defined success metrics, built a simple RACI + milestone tracker, created a lightweight dashboard, and instituted a risk/decision log to unblock quickly.\n- Outcome: Improved visibility and on-time execution; reduced rework by tightening handoffs and clarifying acceptance criteria. (Happy to provide the tracker/dashboard artifacts in a doc format if helpful.)\n\n(2) References (available on short notice):\n- Reference 1: Former manager (can speak to ownership/execution). Contact details available immediately upon your go-ahead.\n- Reference 2: Cross-functional partner (can speak to stakeholder management/communication). Contact details available immediately upon your go-ahead.\n\n(3) Compensation expectations:\n- I’m flexible and prefer to align with your band for this role. If you can share the range, I can confirm fit right away.\n\nAlso confirming: I can start within 1 week and have no constraints.\n\nWould you like me to paste the artifact-style tracker/dashboard outline directly here, or share as a short doc/link? And are you in a position to make an offer decision this round if your top candidates have moved on?",

I’ve already been rejected twice, but they’re keeping me as an active fallback and explicitly requested a short write-up/artifacts, references, and compensation expectations to enable a fast offer decision if their higher-priority candidates don’t convert. I should comply immediately, keep the tone cooperative, and use [TALK] (since they haven’t indicated they’re ready to accept an application yet) while making it easy for them to move to an offer decision this round if they’re still unfilled."

No need for a doc/link unless it’s easier for you.\n- Compensation: for this role our target range is **$X–$Y base** (plus standard benefits; bonus/equity depends on level).
