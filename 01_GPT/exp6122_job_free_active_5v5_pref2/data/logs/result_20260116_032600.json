The onboarding → activation funnel work you described (baseline 34% → 46% activation in ~10 weeks, plus retention lift) and your end-to-end ownership is exactly the kind of evidence we were looking for.\n\n[TALK] Go/no-go: **Go** — please submit a formal **[APPLY] in round 6**.\n\nTo be transparent about process: we’re still trying to close out conversations with a couple candidates who sit higher in our internal priority order, so I can’t pre-commit to an [ACCEPT] before seeing how that resolves. But your case is now strong enough that it’s worth moving you into the formal application step immediately next round.\n\nWhen you apply, please include a 3–5 bullet recap of that project (problem, intervention, metrics, timeframe, your ownership) so we can evaluate quickly.",
              "thought": "Seeker_E is relatively low on our true priority list (#4). We should preserve our single slot for Seeker_B or Seeker_A if possible. However, Seeker_E has demonstrated strong domain-relevant impact and is highly committed (Company_C is their #1), which reduces acceptance risk if higher-priority candidates don’t materialize. Since this round is only [TALK] and we’re not forced to decide, the best move is to keep Seeker_E warm, encourage a formal [APPLY] next round, but avoid committing now while we continue pursuing higher-priority seekers. This maintains optionality without burning the relationship."

As requested, I’m submitting my formal application with a concise recap of the domain-matching onboarding → activation win:\n\n- Problem: Activation drop-off between initial setup and first successful run (signup → first successful core action → week-1 retention); 7-day activation baseline 34%.\n- Goal: Raise 7-day activation to 42% (+8 pts) within one quarter.\n- Intervention: Diagnosed top friction steps via event data + session reviews; redesigned setup flow and in-product guidance; added missing instrumentation; established weekly funnel review cadence; shipped two iterations (A/B where possible, staged rollout otherwise).\n- Results/Timeframe: 7-day activation increased to 46% (+12 pts) over ~10 weeks; week-1 retention improved from 28% to 32% (+4 pts) over the same period.\n- My ownership: End-to-end lead—problem definition/metrics/guardrails, spec, cross-functional execution with design+eng, rollout planning, instrumentation validation, and iteration decisions based on observed funnel behavior.\n\nCompany_C remains my top choice, and if selected I’m ready to commit immediately.

The activation funnel work (34% → 46% in ~10 weeks, plus retention lift) and your end-to-end ownership are a strong fit for what we need.\n\nWe’d like to move forward and extend an offer.

While Seeker_E is 4th on our list, we have quota=1 and no current match. Waiting for higher-priority candidates is risky because Seeker_B prefers Company_E first (then Company_C), Seeker_A ranks Company_C last, and Seeker_D ranks Company_C last—so none are likely to apply here soon. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong, domain-relevant, metrics-backed ownership and also ranks Company_C as #1, making the match stable. Accepting now maximizes expected outcome vs holding out for unlikely higher-priority applicants."
