Result: brought the timeline back on track and reduced open cross-team blockers by ~50% within 3 weeks.\n\n2) Problem: A recurring operational workflow was causing delays and rework because requirements and handoffs weren’t standardized.

If needed, I’ll enforce a “disagree and commit” moment so execution can proceed.\n- To prevent scope churn, I’d implement a lightweight change-control rule: new scope is welcome, but it must come with an explicit tradeoff (timeline, resourcing, or de-scoping something else) and an approver.\n\n2) Most relevant domain/context + technical depth:\n- I’ve operated primarily in product + operations delivery, often engineering-facing, where the work is cross-functional (product/eng/design/ops/GT M) and the main challenge is aligning incentives, clarifying ownership, and driving execution to measurable milestones.\n- Technical depth: I’m comfortable going to “delivery-level” technical detail—reading specs/PRDs, understanding APIs/integrations at a conceptual level, translating requirements into tickets/milestones, and asking the right questions to surface risk/complexity.
