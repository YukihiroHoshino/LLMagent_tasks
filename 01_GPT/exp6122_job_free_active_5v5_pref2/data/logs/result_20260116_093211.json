I defined the workflow, aligned owners/SLAs, built the tracking/communication cadence, and drove the rollout through to adoption; the outcome was faster cycle time and fewer dropped handoffs, with clearer accountability and weekly reporting that leadership relied on.\n\n2) Preferred contact window (next 48 hours): I’m available for a quick final call today 1–6pm or tomorrow 9am–6pm (flexible; I can adjust with short notice). If helpful, I can also make time outside those windows.\n\nCompany_C remains my first choice, and if you’re able to extend an offer I will accept immediately and can start next business day.
