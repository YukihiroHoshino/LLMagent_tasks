In round 1, higher-priority seekers are likely to apply elsewhere first (Seeker_B prefers Company_E then us; Seeker_A ranks us last; Seeker_D ranks us last). However, we only have one slot, and accepting Seeker_E now would prevent us from taking Seeker_B if they come to us after being rejected by Company_E.
