Per your suggestion, here are the two quick items to help triage:\n\n1) Most complex dataset I’ve worked with (scale/schema/quality):\n- Event-level product usage data (tens of millions of rows across multiple event types) joined to relational user/account/order tables. The main complexity was inconsistent event naming/parameters over time plus missing/late events, so I built a normalization layer (standardized event taxonomy + mapping table), added deduping/sessionization logic, and implemented validation checks (volume anomalies, funnel step consistency, and backfills) to make metrics stable enough for weekly KPI reviews.\n\n2) Example where analysis influenced a product decision:\n- I analyzed a major activation funnel drop-off and segmented by acquisition channel + user cohort. The analysis showed a specific step was disproportionately failing for one segment due to a workflow/UX friction. I partnered with Product/Ops to change the flow (reordering steps + clearer prompts) and set up pre/post measurement with a holdout where possible. Impact was measured via step-level conversion, time-to-complete, and downstream retention; we saw a meaningful lift in activation conversion and a reduction in time-to-complete, which led the team to roll the change out broadly.\n\nIf there’s an active req that maps closely to this (Product Analytics / Product Ops Analytics), I’m happy to tailor a 5–6 bullet, role-specific summary aligned to the job scorecard.\n\nThanks again for keeping me in consideration for adjacent roles.",
