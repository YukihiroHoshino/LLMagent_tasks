Measured impact: faster turnaround times and fewer operational escalations post-launch.\n• Project 2 (ramp + reliability): Joined an existing codebase/process midstream, ramped quickly, took over a critical component, and stabilized/extended it. Owned debugging, performance/quality improvements, and documentation so others could operate it confidently.\n\n2) Work sample\n• I can share a concise work sample immediately (write-up + artifacts) tailored to the kind of work you described—e.g., a short case study with problem framing, approach, tradeoffs, and results.
