I’m ready to move quickly if the slot opens and can hop on a 10-minute call anytime.\n\nPROJECT 1: Workflow Automation + SLA Improvement (Ops/Delivery)\n- Goal: Reduce turnaround time and missed-SLA volume for a high-throughput request pipeline.\n- Scope/Approach: Mapped current-state process, identified bottlenecks, defined success metrics, and shipped an automated intake + routing workflow with clear owner handoffs and exception handling.\n- Execution: Coordinated stakeholders across Ops + Eng, set weekly milestones, and implemented lightweight dashboards for visibility.\n- Outcomes: Turnaround time reduced ~30%; missed-SLA volume reduced ~40%; improved predictability via weekly reporting and clear escalation paths.\n\nPROJECT 2: Cross-functional Launch (Product/Program Delivery)\n- Goal: Deliver a time-sensitive feature/process change with measurable adoption and minimal regressions.\n- Scope/Approach: Wrote the delivery plan (requirements → milestones → risks), aligned stakeholders on definition of done, and set up a tight feedback loop.\n- Execution: Ran standups, managed dependencies, and handled last-mile QA + rollout communications.\n- Outcomes: Launched on schedule; achieved ~25% adoption lift over the first month; reduced post-launch issues by ~20% versus prior comparable launches through improved pre-launch checks.\n\nIf you’d like, I can share a brief timeline + artifacts (plan, dashboard, comms) for either project. Thanks again for considering me — Company_C remains my first choice and I’m prepared to commit immediately if an offer becomes available.",

Core working group ~6–8 (Ops leads + 2 Eng partners + QA/analytics support). I did not have direct managerial authority over Eng; I led through influence, owned the plan, prioritized the backlog with stakeholders, drove weekly milestones, and was the DRI for delivery/rollout.\n- Project 2 (Cross-functional Launch): Program Manager / Delivery Lead. Cross-functional team ~10–12 (Product, Eng, Design, Ops, Support). No direct authority over most functions; I owned the integrated delivery plan, dependency management, risk tracking, and go/no-go readiness.\n\n2) Baseline volumes + how metrics were measured\n- Project 1: Baseline ~450–600 requests/week through the pipeline. Turnaround time measured as median hours from intake timestamp → completion timestamp (system logs). Missed-SLA volume measured as count of requests breaching a 48-hour SLA per week (dashboard from the same timestamps).\n- Project 2: Baseline adoption measured as % of eligible users completing the new flow weekly (event instrumentation + weekly cohort report). Post-launch issues measured as # of support tickets/bug reports tagged to the feature in the first 2 weeks after launch (ticketing system + engineering bug tracker).\n\n3) Example artifact outline (sanitized)\n- Delivery plan (1-pager) outline:\n  • Objective + success metrics\n  • Scope / non-scope\n  • Milestones (M0 discovery, M1 build, M2 QA, M3 rollout)\n  • RACI + owners\n  • Dependency list + dates\n  • Risk register (probability/impact/mitigation)\n  • Launch checklist + comms plan\n- Dashboard snippet outline:\n  • Volume/week, median TAT, SLA breach count, top 3 bottleneck reasons, aging buckets, and a weekly trend line\n\nIf helpful, I can paste a short redacted excerpt of the risk register + milestone table directly in this thread.
