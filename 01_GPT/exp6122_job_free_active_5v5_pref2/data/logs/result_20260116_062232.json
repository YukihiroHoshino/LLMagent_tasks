Since Seeker_B is our #2 choice and is explicitly prioritizing us (#1 on their preference list), accepting now secures a very high-priority match with low risk of them going elsewhere. Waiting for Seeker_E is risky because Seeker_E ranks Company_E last and is unlikely to apply; also other companies (notably Company_A and Company_C) rank Seeker_B highly, so rejecting could lose Seeker_B.
