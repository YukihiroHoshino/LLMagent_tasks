Here’s a tailored response for the support ticket handoff workflow improvement.\n\n1) Week-1 “thin slice” (live/usable by end of week 1)\nGoal: deliver a small but real reduction in handoff friction by making ownership + next step unambiguous at the moment a ticket transitions between Support Ops ↔ Product/Eng.\n\nThin-slice deliverable (behind a feature flag, enabled for 1–2 pilot queues/teams):\n- A standardized “Handoff Packet” on the ticket that is *required* when escalating/transitioning (lightweight form/checklist):\n  - problem summary, repro steps (if applicable), customer impact/severity, desired outcome, deadline/SLA, links (logs, screenshots), and a single “requested action” field.\n- Explicit ownership + status transitions:\n  - when handed off, a single DRI is assigned (Product or Eng), with an auto-notification and an “acknowledge” action.\n  - SLA timers start at handoff; if not acknowledged within X hours, it escalates to a defined channel/owner.\n- Basic reporting artifact live by end of week 1:\n  - a simple dashboard (or even a daily exported report if needed initially) showing: time from handoff → acknowledgment, and handoff → resolution for the pilot set.\n\nWhat is “live/usable”:\n- Support Ops can use the new handoff flow for the pilot queue(s) in production (flag on), and Product/Eng receives structured context + clear ownership requests.\n- We can run a real pilot and see measured cycle-time deltas immediately, even if the workflow is minimal and the UI is basic.\n\n2) Top 3 risks + how I’d de-risk in first 72 hours\nRisk #1: Misaligned definitions / process ambiguity (what counts as a “handoff”, who owns what, when does the clock start?)\n- First 72h de-risk:\n  - 60-minute working session with Support Ops lead + Eng manager + PM to define: handoff entry/exit criteria, ownership rules, escalation path, and the single most common handoff scenario to pilot.\n  - Write a 1-page “Handoff Contract” (definitions + RACI + SLA) and get explicit sign-off.\n\nRisk #2: Data/instrumentation gaps (we can’t reliably measure time-to-resolution or even identify handoff events)\n- First 72h de-risk:\n  - Identify system-of-record (ticketing platform + any internal tooling) and confirm the exact fields/events we can log.\n  - Implement minimum viable event logging for: handoff created, acknowledged, resolved (even if via webhook + log table).\n  - Validate with 20 historical tickets to ensure timestamps reflect reality.\n\nRisk #3: Adoption friction / workflow overhead (Support feels it’s extra work; Eng ignores requests; people route around the process)\n- First 72h de-risk:\n  - Keep the Handoff Packet to ~6–8 required fields max; pre-fill where possible.\n  - Pilot with one high-volume queue and one engaged Eng/PM counterpart; daily 10-min feedback loop.\n  - Add “fast path” guidance: when to use the handoff vs. when to stay within Support; publish a short SOP + example of a “good” packet.\n\n3) Success metric for first two weeks + instrumentation/artifact\nPrimary metric (2-week horizon):\n- Median time from “handoff created” → “handoff acknowledged by Product/Eng” (ack latency).\nRationale: it’s directly tied to handoff quality/clarity and is highly sensitive to process improvements within 1–2 weeks.\n\nSecondary (directional) metric:\n- Median time from handoff created → ticket resolution for the pilot set (resolution cycle time), tracked but interpreted cautiously due to case-mix.\n\nInstrumentation/artifact:\n- A simple “Handoff Scorecard” updated daily for the pilot:\n  - volume of handoffs, % acknowledged within SLA, median/90p ack latency, median/90p resolution time, and top 3 rejection/clarification reasons.\n- A weekly qualitative digest: 5 example tickets (2 good, 3 problematic) with what the packet captured/missed and what we’ll adjust.\n\nIf you confirm the ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk/Jira/ServiceNow) and whether we can add custom fields + automation rules, I can tighten this into an exact implementation sequence (what’s config vs. code) and the specific pilot cohort.\n\n[TALK]",

Prefer Explore for Week-1 unless gaps.\n\n**Day 2 (Build the “Handoff Packet” + submission guardrails)**\n- Zendesk config:\n  - Create custom fields (required/optional) + field descriptions/examples.\n  - Create a dedicated **Handoff form** (or conditional fields) shown only for pilot group.\n  - Add a trigger: when ticket is set to “Escalated/Handoff” (or moved to Eng/Product group), enforce required fields (block transition if missing).\n- Code/reporting:\n  - If Explore can’t capture the needed timestamps cleanly, set up a minimal webhook endpoint skeleton (receive ticket_id, event_type, timestamp).\n\n**Day 3 (Ack mechanism + SLA + escalation automation)**\n- Zendesk config:\n  - Add “Acknowledge” workflow: macro/button or status change that sets **Ack timestamp** (via tag + trigger writing to a custom date field if available).\n  - Create automation: if status = New Handoff and Ack timestamp empty after **8 business hours**, send escalation notification to triage channel/alias.\n- Code/reporting:\n  - If using webhook: emit events on handoff-created and acknowledged; store timestamps.\n\n**Day 4 (Reporting + pilot enablement + SOP)**\n- Zendesk config:\n  - Build an Explore dashboard (or view) for: #handoffs, % ack within SLA, median ack time, median time-to-resolution (pilot only).\n  - Create views for triage: “Unacked handoffs,” “Needs info,” “Aged > SLA.”\n- Code/reporting:\n  - If webhook path: generate a simple daily report (CSV/Google Sheet) + basic aggregates.\n- Enablement:\n  - 1-page SOP + 2 examples of “good handoff packets.”\n\n**Day 5 (Dry run + launch + feedback loop)**\n- Zendesk config:\n  - Run 5–10 test tickets end-to-end; verify required-field enforcement, ack flow, and escalations.\n  - Turn on feature flag / enable form for pilot queue(s).\n- Code/reporting:\n  - Verify dashboard/report updates; set daily recap message template.\n- Ops cadence:\n  - Schedule a 10-min daily standup for first week with Support Ops + triage DRI to iterate on field friction and clarify routing.\n\nIf you share (a) which Eng/Product group receives these handoffs and (b) whether you already have a triage rotation/alias, I can lock the exact escalation recipients and the minimal set of Zendesk triggers/automations (by condition/action) for fastest setup.\n\n[TALK]",

the “ack_at is blank” guard ensures the timestamp is only written once even if the field is edited later.\n\n---\n## Automation — SLA breach at 8 business hours → notify triage\n**Name:** Pilot: Unacked handoff SLA breach (8 business hours)\n\n**Conditions (ALL):**\n- Ticket: **Form** is **Eng Handoff (Pilot)**\n- Ticket: **Group** is **Engineering Support (Tier-2)**\n- Ticket: **Status/State** indicates handoff is active (e.g., Status is Open/Pending OR tag contains `handoff_active`)\n- Ticket: **Handoff created at** is **not blank**\n- Ticket: **Handoff acknowledged at** is **blank**\n- Ticket: **Hours since Handoff created at** >= **8 business hours**\n\n**Implementation note (how to do “8 business hours”):**\n- If your instance supports business-hour SLAs: attach an **SLA policy** to pilot tickets (via form/tag) with “First reply/Next reply” target = 8 business hours, and have the automation fire on **SLA breach**.\n- If not, approximate with Zendesk “Hours since update” is calendar hours; it’s acceptable for Week-1, but business-hours SLA is better.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Email: **eng-triage@company_c** (subject: “SLA breach: Unacked handoff”) with ticket link + packet\n- Notify Slack channel **#eng-triage** (via integration) with: ticket link, age since handoff, severity\n- (Optional) Add internal note tagging the triage DRI if you have a “triage_dri” field\n\n---\n## Trigger C — When Support updates missing info, re-notify triage (don’t reset timestamps)\nThere are two clean ways; pick whichever matches your workflow.\n\n### Option 1 (recommended): Support sets a “Support info provided” checkbox/field\n**Custom field:** `support_info_provided` (Checkbox)\n\n**Trigger name:** Pilot: Missing info provided → re-notify triage\n\n**Conditions (ALL):**\n- Ticket: **Form** is **Eng Handoff (Pilot)**\n- Ticket: **Tags** contains `handoff_need_info`\n- Ticket: **Support info provided** is **checked**\n- Ticket: **Handoff created at** is **not blank**\n\n**Actions:**\n- Remove tag: `handoff_need_info`\n- (Optional) Clear `ack_outcome` ONLY if you want triage to re-ack (I’d avoid clearing in Week-1; instead add a new tag `handoff_info_updated`)\n- Notify: **#eng-triage** + **eng-triage@company_c** with “Info updated; please re-review.”\n- Add internal note summarizing what changed (Support can paste)\n\n### Option 2: Re-notify when specific required fields change while in Need more info\n**Trigger name:** Pilot: Required fields updated while Need more info → re-notify\n\n**Conditions (ALL):**\n- Ticket: **Form** is **Eng Handoff (Pilot)**\n- Ticket: **Tags** contains `handoff_need_info`\n- Ticket: (any of) **Problem summary/desired outcome** is not blank OR **Repro/links** is not blank OR **Severity** is not blank\n\n**Actions:**\n- Notify triage (Slack + email)\n- (No timestamp fields touched)\n\nIn both options, we never touch `handoff_created_at` or `handoff_ack_at`, so Explore duration reporting stays stable.\n\n---\n## Earliest start date + 2-week paid trial\n- **Earliest start:** I can start **next Monday** (or sooner if you need immediate availability this week).\n- **2-week paid trial:** Yes — I’m fully open to a **2-week paid trial** aligned to shipping this pilot (Zendesk config + rollout + reporting + iteration loop). We can define success criteria up front (pilot live in 5 business days; measurable ack-latency movement; adoption feedback; and a Week-2 iteration plan).\n\nIf you confirm whether you already use Zendesk SLA policies + Slack integration, I can tighten the SLA breach implementation to the exact mechanism in your stack.",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched and it is my top preference. They are actively engaging via [TALK] and asked for concrete Zendesk trigger/automation blocks plus start date/trial availability. Providing the requested implementation details increases credibility and may convert the conversation into an offer; I will also clearly state earliest start date and openness to a 2-week paid trial. Use [TALK] (not [APPLY]) because they haven’t invited a formal application decision yet and we’re mid-specification."

Thank you for writing it in admin-ready “conditions → actions” form.\n\nOn your last question: yes, we **do** use Zendesk **SLA policies** with **business hours**, and we **do** have the **Slack integration** enabled (so we can post directly into #eng-triage / #support-ops).\n\nGiven that, your approach is exactly what we want to pilot. Next steps on our side:\n1) We’ll align internally on the pilot scope (which Support group(s) + confirm the “Eng Handoff (Pilot)” form).\n2) We’ll schedule a 30-min working session with Support Ops + Eng Support (Tier-2) to finalize the required fields and the ack outcomes.\n3) We’ll draft success criteria for the **2-week paid trial** (pilot live by day 5; baseline + week-1 + week-2 ack-latency reporting; adoption feedback + iteration plan).\n\nIf you’re ready to move forward, please send an **[APPLY]** next round confirming:\n- earliest start date (you said next Monday; confirm), and\n- that you’re aligned to a **2-week paid trial** scoped to delivering this pilot + reporting.\n\nWe’ll be prepared to proceed quickly once we receive your application.",
              "thought": "We are Company_C with quota 1 and true priority list: Seeker_B > Seeker_A > Seeker_D > Seeker_E > Seeker_C. Only Seeker_E is in our inbox this round, and we have an extensive history where we repeatedly rejected Seeker_E’s APPLY attempts while holding out for higher-priority candidates. However, by round 10 no higher-priority seekers have engaged us; given the market may have largely matched elsewhere, continuing to hold the slot risks ending unmatched. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong fit for our stated execution-owner gap with highly actionable Zendesk-specific implementation detail and willingness to start quickly on a 2-week paid trial. Since Seeker_E is on our acceptable list (rank 4) and appears to be the best available, we should progress toward closing. Because the current message is tagged TALK, we must respond with TALK and should prompt an APPLY next round while signaling strong intent and outlining concrete next steps/terms for the trial."

Given Seeker_E’s demonstrated strong fit for the specific Zendesk pilot and clear start date/trial alignment, accepting is optimal under uncertainty and fills the role with an in-list candidate."
