Seeker_C has explicitly stated Company_D is their top choice and has applied, so accepting secures a very high-priority match immediately with no risk. Holding out for Seeker_A is risky because Seeker_A ranks Company_D only 3rd (behind Company_E and Company_B), so they may never apply or may match elsewhere first. With quota 1 and only Seeker_C in the inbox this round, the optimal move is to accept Seeker_C now."

Although Company_E ranks me 4th (behind Seeker_E, Seeker_B, Seeker_A), it is still my best first move because any later attempt would be weaker once they start holding a preferred candidate.

In this round, Seeker_B and Seeker_A (both ranked above Seeker_D) have applied to Company_E, and both list Company_E as their top choice, so they are likely to accept immediately if we accept them. Accepting Seeker_D now would block hiring a higher-priority candidate available immediately. Since we must choose for Seeker_D now and cannot defer with [TALK] on an [APPLY], the optimal move is to reject Seeker_D to preserve capacity for Seeker_B (or Seeker_A)."

E (our top choice) has not applied and, given Seeker_E ranks Company_E last, is unlikely to apply later. Seeker_B is our #2 choice and also ranks Company_E as their #1, so accepting now secures a highly preferred and mutually aligned match within our quota.

In round 1, only Seeker_E applied to us, but Seeker_B ranks us 2nd and may apply soon if not accepted by Company_E; Seeker_A ranks us last so unlikely; Seeker_D ranks us last so unlikely. If we reject Seeker_E now, we risk ending unmatched if Seeker_B goes elsewhere.
