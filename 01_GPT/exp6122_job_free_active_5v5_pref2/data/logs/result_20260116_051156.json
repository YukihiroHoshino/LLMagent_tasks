Thanks again for the clarity on your plan to hold the spot through the next two rounds.\n\nSince we’re in Round 6 now, I’ll plan to follow your request and send a formal [APPLY] right at the start of Round 7 if you’re still unmatched.\n\nIn the meantime, is there anything specific you’d like me to include in that Round 7 application to help you make a quick decision (e.g., a short skills summary, references, or confirmation of any role expectations)? And if your status changes earlier (e.g., your top candidates match elsewhere), please let me know—I’m ready to apply and commit immediately.\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Only Company_C remains unmatched and it is my #1 true preference. Company_C previously indicated they will hold the spot through the next two rounds and asked me to apply at the start of Round 7 if still available. Since it is currently Round 6, an [APPLY] now is unlikely to be accepted while they are still waiting on higher-priority candidates. The best move is to send a [TALK] message to stay warm, confirm I will apply immediately at Round 7, and ask for any final info they’d want included to make a fast decision if they pivot sooner."

Given Seeker_B ranks us #2 and may still apply, and we have no competing applicants in this round besides Seeker_E (who is only [TALK]), it is optimal to continue holding the slot through Round 6 as previously communicated. We should keep Seeker_E warm with clear instructions for a fast Round 7 decision while not committing prematurely."

Given the market preferences: Seeker_B prefers Company_E then Company_C, so they may still be in play, but Company_E prioritizes Seeker_E then Seeker_B and may accept Seeker_B if they apply there; Seeker_A ranks us last; Seeker_D ranks us last; Seeker_C ranks us 2nd but prefers Company_D first and is last on our list. Continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched or being forced later to choose an even lower-priority option. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong commitment (Company_C is their #1), flexibility, immediate start, and provided reference as requested. With quota 1 and no better candidates in inbox, accepting now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) candidate rather than risking losing them and remaining unfilled."
