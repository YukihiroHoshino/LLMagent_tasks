Strong fit usually looks like: solid fundamentals, willingness to seek help and take on challenge, and a clear sense of what you want to explore in high school.\n\nA few quick questions so I can be specific: what subjects or activities are you most excited about, and what kind of environment helps you thrive (more structured vs. more independent)?\n\nIf your top choices don’t work out and you decide to apply to School_D later, it helps to share (1) what you want to pursue here and (2) how you’ll contribute beyond grades. If you do apply, we can make a decision quickly given remaining capacity.",
