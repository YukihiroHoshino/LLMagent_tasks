If you ever feel stuck, it’s easy to get 1:1 help quickly.\n- Counseling/advising: Each student has an assigned counselor/advisor who helps with course planning, workload balance, and goal-setting. We’re proactive about check-ins—especially during transitions (start of year, exam periods).\n\n2) Standout clubs/activities (examples)\n- STEM / project-based: A student-led robotics/coding community and a science research/project club where students build portfolios and present work.\n- Community / leadership: Student council and service-oriented clubs that organize school-wide initiatives—great for students who like taking ownership and leading teams.\n(If you tell me your interests—STEM, arts, sports, debate, etc.—I can point you to the most relevant groups.)\n\n3) Who thrives most at School_A\nStudents who do best here are (a) academically curious and willing to ask for help early, (b) consistent and self-directed with their time, and (c) community-minded—people who contribute positively in class and in clubs.

Given all schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I am relatively low priority everywhere, so delaying risks losing my top option if higher-priority students apply later. Since School_D is still unmatched, applying now maximizes my chance to secure my best outcome."

With quota 1 and only Students A, B, and D remaining unmatched, A and B both prefer other schools above School_D, so there is a meaningful risk we end unmatched if we reject D. Accepting Student_D secures a match now rather than gambling on higher-ranked students who may not apply or may match elsewhere."

Student_B is applying now and states School_A is their first choice and will commit, which secures our single seat immediately. If we reject to wait for Student_A, we risk losing the seat if Student_A matches elsewhere (Student_A prefers School_B first) or delays applying. With quota 1 and no current matches, accepting Student_B is a strong, low-risk outcome that places us near the top of our priority list."
