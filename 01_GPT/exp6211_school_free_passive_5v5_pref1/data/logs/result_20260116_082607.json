I’m glad you’re considering School_B.\n\n**What distinguishes School_B**\n- **Academics:** We emphasize strong core instruction with clear pathways for students who want either enrichment/advanced work or structured support. Students commonly build a balanced first-year schedule that keeps options open for advanced courses later.\n- **Clubs & student life:** We value students who explore. Many first-years try 1–2 clubs early (academic teams, arts, service, or sports) and then commit more deeply by mid-year.\n- **Student support:** Advising is proactive—students get help with goal-setting, study habits, and course planning so they can ramp up smoothly in the first semester.\n\n**Qualities we value in incoming students**\nWe look for students who are **curious, consistent, and community-minded**—not just high achievers, but students who ask questions, follow through, and contribute positively to peers and school culture.\n\n**Common first-year opportunities students take advantage of**\n- Joining a club or team early to find community\n- Meeting with advisors/teachers to set academic goals and routines\n- Taking on small leadership or service roles that grow over time\n\nIf you share a bit about what you’re most excited about (e.g., STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, service) and what kind of support helps you thrive, I can point you to the best first-year path at School_B.

In round 1 they are only talking, so we should actively sell School_B’s strengths and try to elicit an application soon, while signaling strong interest without committing an acceptance prematurely (since Student_A may also apply later and is our top priority).

Best move is to keep them engaged, communicate we may fill if a top-priority applicant commits, but we will remain open and encourage them to apply if School_E becomes their best option. Gather timeline and what “higher-ranked fits” are to assess likelihood; gently create urgency without committing."
