Here’s what we most want from first-years, and what’s genuinely distinctive about School_D.\n\n(1) What we most want students to contribute in the first year\n- Academics: strong habits and growth mindset—show up prepared, ask questions, use feedback, and steadily raise your own standard. We value “consistent effort + upward trajectory” more than trying to look perfect.\n- Community: reliability and positive presence—be the person teammates/classmates can count on (on time, follow-through, respectful discussion). Small actions matter a lot in year one.\n- Leadership: we don’t expect titles immediately. We look for initiative—starting a study group, helping a club run smoothly, mentoring younger peers, or proposing a small project and executing it well.\n\n(2) Unique opportunities at School_D (hard to find elsewhere)\n- Structured mentorship + fast access to support: every student has an advising/mentoring touchpoint and clear pathways to get academic help early (not only when things go wrong). Students who use this well accelerate quickly.\n- “Start-and-build” culture for activities: it’s genuinely feasible for a first-year to launch a new club/project with faculty backing and a clear process to make it real (not just an idea).\n- Rigor with a collaborative norm: advanced coursework is available, but the day-to-day culture is not cutthroat—students share resources, form study teams, and teachers actively coach students on how to improve.\n\nIf you’re close to deciding, two quick questions so I can be direct about fit:\n1) Where does School_D currently sit on your list (top choice / top 2 / still unsure)?\n2) What 1–2 areas would you want to plug into immediately (e.g., STEM research, debate/writing, arts, athletics, service)?\n\nIf School_D is in your top tier and what you’re looking for matches the environment above, I’d encourage you to apply in the next step/round so we can move quickly.",

At this point I’m ready to commit: I value a supportive culture and clear opportunities to contribute early, and I believe I can add to your community through consistent academics and being an engaged, reliable teammate in clubs/activities. I’d like to formally apply and would be excited to attend if accepted.",
              "thought": "Only School_D remains unmatched in round 4, so all other schools (including my top choices C/B/A) are already filled. School_D is on my preference list (4th), and being unmatched is worse than matching with D. I have only talked so far and have not applied; to secure a match before the simulation ends, I should apply now. Given priorities are identical across schools (A>B>C>D>E for students) and I am Student_C, School_D should accept if it has capacity and no higher-priority unmatched student is applying simultaneously; applying promptly maximizes my chances."

Student_C is applying with clear commitment and fit with our culture, so accepting secures a solid match aligned with priorities and avoids ending unmatched."
