Given priorities are identical across schools (A > B > C > D > E), I have strong priority at School_B (2nd overall), so applying now should secure a match and avoids the risk of ending up at School_E (which I rank 4th) or unmatched. I have not interacted with School_B yet, so I can apply directly with a brief, positive fit statement."

School_B would be excited to offer you admission: we do have an opening this cycle, and we believe our rigorous academics, supportive faculty, and wide range of clubs and activities align well with your goals. If you’re ready to commit, we’re delighted to welcome you to School_B.",

We have 1 seat and prefer Student_B over Student_E. Student_B is applying and states willingness to commit. Accepting now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with only a lower-priority option."
