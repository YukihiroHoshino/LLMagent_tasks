Placement is flexible—students can join based on diagnostic results or teacher recommendation.\n- Study groups with structure: First-years can opt into guided study groups led by a teacher or senior mentor where the agenda is set (goal-setting, timed practice, error logs, re-test plans). This helps students who work hard but need a clearer method.\n- Progress checks & advising: Regular check-ins (quiz cycles + periodic diagnostics) feed into an individual plan—what to maintain, what to fix next, and how to allocate weekly study time. If a student is aiming for a very competitive track, we’ll map milestones early rather than waiting until later years.\n\n2) Clubs & leadership opportunities for first-year students\n- Open entry period: First-years can visit clubs during an initial trial window and join immediately—most clubs actively recruit first-years.\n- Early responsibility: Many clubs assign first-years concrete roles (event planning support, team manager, publications/social media, equipment, meeting facilitation). Students who show reliability often move into committee leads within the first year.\n- School-wide opportunities: We also have volunteer/project teams (events, tutoring/community service, academic competitions) where first-years can take initiative without needing to “wait their turn.”\n\nIf you share (a) the exams/track you’re targeting and (b) which subjects you want to improve most, I can point you to the exact supports that would fit you best.

We expect to make decisions on a rolling basis as soon as we receive formal applications, and our remaining seat could be filled in the next few rounds depending on who applies and confirms.\n\nIf School_B is a serious contender for you, the best way to stay in strong consideration is to **apply as soon as you feel ready**, because once our final seat is taken we won’t be able to hold additional offers.\n\n**What we’re prioritizing most this year**\nBroadly, we’re prioritizing students who show:\n- **Strong academic readiness + upward trajectory** (rigor in context, consistency, growth)\n- **Initiative/curiosity** (projects, competitions, self-driven learning, building something)\n- **Community contribution** (reliability, teamwork, leadership/service)\n- **Clear fit with School_B** (specific programs you’d use and why)\n\nOn the academic-interest side, we’re especially excited about students who can articulate a plan for how they’d engage deeply—whether that’s **STEM/research/project work**, **writing/seminar-style humanities**, or **debate/public speaking**.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can give you a candid read on fit and next steps:\n1) Where does School_B currently sit on your preference list (e.g., #1, top 2, etc.)?\n2) What 1–2 academic areas are you most eager to pursue here, and what’s one concrete example of initiative you’ve taken in that area?\n\nIf you’re close to ready and School_B is near the top, you’re welcome to submit an application in the next step and we’ll review promptly.",
              "thought": "We have 1 seat and no matches yet; remaining unmatched students are A and B. Our true priority ranks A above B, but B is still high (2nd) and is actively engaged. Student_A ranks School_B first, so we may still attract A later; however, we risk ending unmatched if we wait too long and A matches elsewhere. Since Student_B is asking about timeline and fit (not applying yet), we should keep them warm, signal that we may fill soon, and encourage a prompt application while gathering their top-choice info to assess likelihood. Do not accept without [APPLY]."
