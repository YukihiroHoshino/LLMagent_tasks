Advising covers course selection, workload balance, and long-term planning (what to take when, and why).\n- Exam prep support is built around a plan: diagnostic early, targeted practice sets, and scheduled review blocks. If a student is pushing for top outcomes, we coordinate subject teachers + advisor so prep doesn’t become scattered or last-minute.\n- We also run study-skills and time-management workshops, and we’ll set up small-group tutoring when a student is stretching into advanced sections.\n\n3) Standout extracurriculars / competitions\n- Common “standout” areas include STEM club projects (coding/data, engineering builds), academic competitions (math/science/quiz-style), debate/speaking, arts showcases, and service/leadership initiatives.\n- Students who want competitions typically get help forming teams, finding a coach/mentor, and setting a realistic training schedule alongside academics.\n\nSupport for top university admissions\n- We emphasize sustained academic rigor, strong writing, and tangible outputs (research projects, competition participation, leadership roles).\n- Advisors help students map a multi-year profile: course rigor, extracurricular depth, and milestones (projects, presentations, awards). Teachers provide recommendation support through documented progress and mentorship.\n\nTo tailor this: are you leaning more STEM or humanities, and are you aiming for competition results, research/projects, or leadership/service as your main differentiator for top admissions?",

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Student_C and Student_E remain unmatched. Our true priority ranks Student_A highest and Student_E lowest, but Student_A/B/D are already matched elsewhere, leaving only C and E feasible. Student_C prefers us last and has only been talking, so likelihood of securing C is low. Student_E ranks us first and has applied now, so accepting guarantees filling our seat rather than risking ending unmatched. Given we prefer filling with any listed student over leaving empty, accept Student_E."
