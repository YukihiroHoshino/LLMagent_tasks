I’m especially interested in your academic strengths and the student support systems (advising/tutoring/counseling) you offer, and I’d be excited to contribute to campus life through clubs and activities. If admitted, I’m ready to commit and would be grateful for the opportunity to join School_A.",
              "thought": "School_A is my 3rd choice (after School_C and School_B). In this market, all schools share the same priority order A > B > C > D > E, so I (Student_C) rank behind Student_A and Student_B everywhere. Since School_C and School_B are already matched, my best remaining option is School_A. However, Student_B prefers School_A first and Student_D ranks School_A second, so waiting could risk losing School_A if either applies. I already initiated a TALK with School_A in round 1, so now I should apply to lock in my best remaining feasible match."

We’re happy to offer you admission to School_A.\n\nWe’re excited about your interest in our academic program and in making use of advising/tutoring/counseling supports—students who actively engage with those resources tend to thrive here. We also appreciate your eagerness to contribute through clubs and activities; that kind of community involvement is a big part of our culture.\n\nIf you have any last questions about course pathways, advising, or extracurricular options, send them anytime—we’re glad to help as you prepare to join us.",

Student_A and Student_B are ranked above Student_C, but they are not available in this round and may match elsewhere; waiting risks ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked option. Student_C is applying now and signals strong commitment. Accepting secures a solid match within quota and aligns with our preference to fill with a prioritized student."
