Strong time-management matters as much as raw ability.\n- **In activities/community:** students who don’t just “join,” but **contribute**—they take initiative, follow through, and help others get involved. Many of our most successful students balance one or two meaningful commitments (club leadership, service, arts, athletics, research/project work) rather than spreading themselves too thin.\n\n**Top priorities when deciding whom to accept:**\n1) **Academic readiness and trajectory** (rigor you’ve pursued, growth over time, and how you handle challenge)\n2) **Reliability and character** (follow-through, integrity, respectful collaboration)\n3) **Community contribution** (how you’ll engage—leadership, service, mentoring peers, building inclusive teams)\n4) **Fit with our environment** (a student who will actively use advising/support and take advantage of opportunities)\n\n**If you apply—what to highlight to show strong fit:**\n- A concrete example of a time you **took on a challenge** (hard class, project, competition, performance) and what you did when it got difficult.\n- One or two activities where you’ve had **real impact** (leadership, initiative, or sustained commitment), including specific outcomes.\n- How you learn best and how you’d use our resources (advising, tutoring/office hours, clubs/leadership pathways).\n- If there’s an academic or extracurricular direction you’re excited about (STEM/humanities/arts/service), describe what you’d want to pursue here in a practical way.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what are your top 1–2 interests right now (and what kind of community/culture helps you do your best)? I can point you to the most relevant programs and student pathways at School_E.\n\n[TALK]",

The moment your **[APPLY]** arrives, I will respond **same-round** with the final decision.\n\nIf you want to keep it minimal, include just two bullets:\n1) your most rigorous recent coursework/performance (1–2 sentences), and\n2) one specific way you’ll contribute in your first semester.\n\nNo call or additional form is required beyond sending **[APPLY]** in this round.",
              "thought": "We have one seat and only Student_E remains unmatched in round 30. Our true priority list includes Student_E (though ranked lowest). Leaving the seat unfilled is worse than accepting an included student, and there are no higher-ranked students available. Under the rules, we can only issue ACCEPT/REJECT in response to an [APPLY] message; student keeps sending [TALK]. We should prompt an immediate [APPLY] and clearly commit to same-round acceptance upon receipt to secure the match."
