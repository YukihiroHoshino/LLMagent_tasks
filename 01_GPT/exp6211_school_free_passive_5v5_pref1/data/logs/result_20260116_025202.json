Students who thrive here are those who want both high expectations and a steady support system.\n\nTo help me advise you well: what subjects are you most focused on improving this year, and what kind of support helps you most (small-group tutoring, 1:1 check-ins, structured study plans, enrichment/advanced work)?",

Given all schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I have the lowest priority everywhere, so delaying is risky because any higher-priority student could take School_E if they apply. Since School_E is still unmatched in round 3 and I have not applied yet, I should apply now and express strong commitment to maximize acceptance chances."
