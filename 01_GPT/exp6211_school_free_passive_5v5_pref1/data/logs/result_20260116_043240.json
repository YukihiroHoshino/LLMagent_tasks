              "thought": "School_C is 4th on my true list (E > B > A > C > D). Since all schools rank students A>B>C>D>E, I have the lowest priority everywhere, so my best chance is to avoid applying too early to mid/low options and try for higher choices first. In round 1 with School_C, I should keep the door open without committing, and gather any info, saving my [APPLY] for School_E or School_B if I get the chance."

At School_C, we value students who show strong academic readiness (solid fundamentals and curiosity), consistent effort over time, and a clear fit with what we offer. We also look for positive community impact—leadership is great, but so is reliable participation, teamwork, and initiative in clubs, sports, arts, service, or independent projects.\n\nWhat tends to stand out:\n- A clear academic interest area (even if you’re still exploring) and evidence you pursue it\n- Growth mindset: improvement, resilience, and reflective learning habits\n- Contribution to school culture: collaboration, respect, and follow-through\n\nTo help you assess fit, could you share what subjects/activities you’re most excited about and what you’re looking for in a high school (rigor, club offerings, support, environment)? Also, where does School_C currently sit on your list of options (top choice / one of several / still exploring)?",
              "thought": "Student_E is lowest on our true priority list. They are only in TALK mode, so we should not commit. Provide a helpful, positive overview while gently encouraging an application if they become serious, but keep flexibility to pursue higher-priority students (A/B/C/D) who are more likely to be attainable. Gather info on Student_E’s interests and whether School_C is a realistic top choice."

At School_E, our biggest strengths are (1) structured academic coaching and teacher accessibility, (2) strong preparation for cumulative exams through frequent feedback cycles, and (3) a supportive community that helps students build consistent study habits.\n\nAcademically, students often highlight:\n- Rigorous core courses with clear pacing and weekly check-ins (helpful if you like knowing exactly where you stand).\n- Advanced coursework options for students who want to push faster once fundamentals are solid.\n- Writing and problem-solving support through small-group clinics and office hours.\n\nIn terms of student support, we focus on early intervention—if a student slips in a unit, we respond quickly with a plan (tutoring blocks, teacher meetings, and progress tracking). Students who thrive here tend to be curious and willing to engage—whether you’re already high-performing or you’re motivated and want a system that helps you steadily improve.\n\nSo I can tailor what to share: what matters most to you right now—advanced classes, exam prep/results, clubs and leadership, or day-to-day support and mentoring? And what kind of learning environment helps you do your best (fast-paced, highly structured, discussion-based, etc.)?",

Student_A ranks School_B first, so applying now is likely to be rejected if Student_A also applies.
