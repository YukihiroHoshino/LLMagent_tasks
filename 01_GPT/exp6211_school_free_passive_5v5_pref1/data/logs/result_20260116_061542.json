A hallmark of School_E is how intentionally we connect classes to real projects—students regularly present, build portfolios, and get coached on communication and study systems (not just content).\n\n**Student support:** Advising is a big differentiator here. Students have consistent check-ins with an advisor who helps with goal-setting, workload planning, and course selection. If a student hits a rough patch, we’re proactive about tutoring and teacher office hours rather than waiting for grades to slip.\n\n**Clubs & community:** We have a wide range of clubs, but what stands out is that it’s easy to start something new—students who have an idea can get support to launch a club or project group. Leadership opportunities are common even for underclassmen.\n\n**Who thrives at School_E:** Students who do best here are curious, willing to ask for help early, and interested in improving steadily over time. We’re a great fit for students who want both challenge *and* a supportive structure—people who like being part of a community where teachers know them well.\n\nTo help me be specific: what matters most to you right now—advanced academics, a particular extracurricular area (STEM/arts/sports), college guidance, or a supportive environment? And what kind of school culture helps you do your best?",

Student_E ranks School_E as top choice and is applying with commitment. Student_C prefers School_C/B/A/D over E and previously said E is not top, so unlikely to apply/accept. To avoid ending unmatched and to secure a committed student, accept Student_E now."
