Many clubs intentionally assign a first-year “owner” for a small deliverable so you can build a track record quickly.\n- **Leadership pathway:** Formal officer roles are typically elected/selected after you’ve participated for a bit, but students who show consistent follow-through can move into **committee lead / project lead** roles within the year.\n\n**(2) Flexibility in course selection for a stronger academic track**\n- **Placement + acceleration:** We use placement/prior performance to place students appropriately, and there are **clear steps to move into honors/advanced sections** (meeting benchmark performance + teacher recommendation).\n- **Adjustment window:** There’s an early-term check-in period where we can **adjust level** if a student is clearly ready for more challenge (or needs a different pace).\n- **Planning support:** Advisors help you map a multi-year plan so you can aim for advanced work without overloading all at once.\n\nTo help you compare options: what’s the *stronger track* you’re aiming for (e.g., advanced math/science, writing/humanities), and where does School_D currently sit on your list relative to your top 2 choices?
