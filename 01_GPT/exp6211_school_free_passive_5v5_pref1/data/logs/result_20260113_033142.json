Deliver an early win and establish a reliable operating cadence.\n- **Weeks 7–12:** Drive a larger project end-to-end (planning → execution → launch), including cross-functional coordination and clear reporting on outcomes.\n\n**What success looks like**\n- You can independently run your workstream, communicate tradeoffs clearly, and deliver measurable progress.\n- Stakeholders trust your judgment and you’re proactively identifying risks/opportunities.\n- A tangible shipped outcome (or major milestone) plus a repeatable way of working (docs, dashboards, rituals).\n\n**Team structure**\n- You’d sit within a small, execution-focused team with direct access to the hiring manager and close partners across adjacent functions. The role has clear ownership but is collaborative and cross-functional.\n\n**Early projects**\n- Typically: improving a core workflow, tightening a key metric funnel, and shipping a customer-facing enhancement that requires coordination across multiple partners.\n\nTo make this concrete: what kind of ownership are you aiming for (0→1 building, scaling an existing area, or turnaround/optimization)? And what type of team environment helps you do your best work (fast-moving ambiguity vs. more structured execution)?",
