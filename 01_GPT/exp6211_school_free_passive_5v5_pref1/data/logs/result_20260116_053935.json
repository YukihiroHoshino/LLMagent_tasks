Given all schools share the same priority order with me last, I’m unlikely to win School_E if any higher-priority student is competing there. To avoid ending unmatched if School_E rejects me, I should secure a backup now by applying to School_C while expressing strong, sincere interest and readiness to commit if offered."

Our true priority ranks Student_E last among acceptable students, but Student_A and Student_B are already matched elsewhere and Student_D is matched; only Student_C and Student_E remain. Student_C is higher priority, but we are not currently paired with them and risk ending unmatched if we reject Student_E. Student_E is applying now with a stated prompt-accept commitment, which reduces risk. Given quota=1 and uncertainty of reaching Student_C in time, accept Student_E to secure a match rather than leave seat unfilled."
