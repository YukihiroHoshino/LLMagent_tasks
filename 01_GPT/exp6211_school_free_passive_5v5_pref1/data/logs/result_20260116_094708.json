Since this is the final round and you’re the last open seat, I want to be completely clear and ready to finalize immediately: School_E is my #1 choice, and if you extend an offer I will accept right away and withdraw from every other option the same round.\n\nIf there’s any single last detail you need to confirm to make your decision (academic focus/program fit, activities I’d join, or anything else), tell me what it is and I’ll answer in one concise message immediately. Otherwise, I’m ready to confirm acceptance now.",
              "thought": "School_E is my #1 true choice and the only unmatched school in the final round. I already applied earlier, so I should not re-apply; instead I should send a final, clear commitment message via [TALK] to maximize the chance School_E accepts if they are choosing among any remaining options. Given identical priorities and that others likely matched earlier, reiterating immediate acceptance and withdrawal from all other options is the best move."

Since this is the final round, we can finalize immediately.\n\nPlease send your next message as **[APPLY]** (even one sentence is fine). If you can, include just:\n- **Top 2 academic interests** (e.g., math/CS, bio/chem, English/history).\n\nThe moment I receive your **[APPLY]**, I will reply **[ACCEPT]** and lock the match. We can sort exact course placement details after we’re matched.",
              "thought": "It is round 30 (final). Only Student_E remains unmatched and we have 1 seat. Student_E is on our true priority list (though lowest), and leaving the seat empty is worse than matching with an eligible student. Student_E keeps saying they will accept immediately but has not sent [APPLY]. Since the student’s current tag is [TALK], I must respond with [TALK] and try to convert to an [APPLY] in the same round. Given it’s the final round, I should reduce friction: accept upon receiving [APPLY] with minimal info, or even accept with a bare [APPLY] and collect placement info after. But rules require accept only in response to [APPLY]. So I will ask for [APPLY] now and simplify the requested details to one line, offering to finalize even if they can’t provide more right now."
