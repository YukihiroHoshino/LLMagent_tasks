Here’s the clearest answer we can give.\n\n**Timing (decision this round vs later):** If you apply this round and your application shows strong fit, we *can* make a final decision immediately. That said, we’re also willing to keep our seat open into later rounds **for a short time** if a student we’re seriously considering is still finalizing their choice. We just try not to hold the spot indefinitely if it’s unlikely to convert.\n\n**Top 1–2 qualities for the remaining seat right now:**\n1) **Academic readiness + growth mindset** (solid fundamentals, uses feedback, steady improvement).\n2) **Reliability and community contribution** (follows through, communicates early when stuck, and will engage positively in the community—club/team/service/leadership in any form).\n\nTo help us be fair about timing: if we offered you admission, how likely is it that you would enroll at School_E (e.g., “definite,” “likely,” or “still unsure”)? And what’s the one factor you’re still weighing most heavily?",
              "thought": "We have 1 seat and only Student_D and Student_E remain unmatched. Our true priority ranks D above E, and we already rejected E earlier. Student_D has not applied yet and is still deciding; we should keep them engaged and gently create urgency without committing to hold the seat indefinitely. Since no other candidates exist, we can credibly say we can decide as soon as an application comes in, but may keep the seat open briefly if needed. Emphasize top qualities: readiness/growth mindset and follow-through/community contribution, and ask a direct question about likelihood to enroll if accepted to reduce risk."

              "thought": "School_D is my last choice, but it is still on my true list. At round 4 only School_D and School_E remain unmatched. I already applied to School_E earlier; given identical school priorities (A>B>C>D>E ordering of students), Student_E is lowest priority everywhere, so if any higher-priority student applies to School_E later, I will lose it. Since School_D is available now and matching ends once all are matched, I should secure School_D rather than risk being unmatched if School_E doesn’t accept me. I will apply to School_D now with a sincere but realistic commitment."

The only other unmatched student is Student_D, who ranks higher for us and has School_D as their first choice, but they are not the current applicant and may match elsewhere if we wait. Given Student_E is applying now and we prefer filling the seat with an acceptable student rather than risking ending unmatched, accept Student_E to secure a match this round."
