Students who like to build something—launch a club initiative, compete, perform, or lead service projects—tend to find traction quickly.\n3) Community and reliability: We put a lot of weight on follow-through and collaboration. Students who thrive here are curious, consistent, and comfortable asking for help early.\n\nTop priorities when evaluating applicants:\n- Academic habits and trajectory (effort, improvement, intellectual curiosity)\n- Character and community fit (integrity, respect, reliability)\n- Initiative/engagement (depth in interests, leadership or sustained commitment)\n\nTo help you compare us against your other options: what are your top 2–3 priorities (e.g., strongest academics, a particular extracurricular like debate/robotics/music/sports, or a very hands-on support system)?

We’re not trying to “hold” the seat unnecessarily, but we also won’t rush into a mismatch. Practically: if you’re seriously considering School_E, I’d encourage you to apply next round rather than waiting.\n\n2) **What would we want from you to feel confident about an application next round?**\nIf you apply, the main things we’d want (and can decide quickly with) are:\n- **Your level of commitment**: if we accept, are you prepared to enroll (i.e., School_E is at/near the top of your list)?\n- **Your academic goals for next year**: which subjects you want to push hardest (math, writing, science, etc.) and whether you’re aiming for advanced coursework.\n- **Your work style**: what helps you succeed (structure, feedback frequency, independent pace), and where you typically struggle so we can support you well.\n- **Your involvement interests**: any clubs/leadership you’d want to pursue so we can talk realistically about balancing it with rigor.\n\nIf you answer two quick questions now, I can tell you candidly whether you should apply next round:\n1) Where is School_E on your final list right now (top 1, top 2, or lower)?\n2) What are your top 1–2 academic priorities next year (e.g., advanced math track, stronger writing, balanced rigor + support)?",

Student_C is still weighing options; provide transparency that we may fill quickly if a top-priority student applies, and ask for commitment signal and fit info to decide quickly next round.
