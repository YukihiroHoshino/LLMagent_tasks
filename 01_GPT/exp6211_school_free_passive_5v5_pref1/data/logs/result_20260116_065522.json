If we receive an [APPLY] from a student who is a strong fit, we’re prepared to decide promptly. That said, we can’t hold our single seat open indefinitely if we have a candidate ready to commit.\n\nTo help you demonstrate fit, it’s most useful to be specific: what parts of School_B’s program/culture are you most excited about, and what are your top 2 schools right now (and your timeline for applying)?",

The emphasis is on producing a polished final product and presenting it.\n- **Academic coaching/advisory:** Every student has an advisor who helps with goal-setting, workload planning, and progress check-ins—this is a big reason students say they feel “on track” here.\n\n2) **Student life (clubs/teams, community vibe)**\n- **Student-led clubs with real ownership:** Clubs tend to be active because students run them and faculty advise. Leadership opportunities are common, even for underclassmen.\n- **Collaborative vibe:** The culture is generally “work hard, help each other.” Students form study groups and it’s normal to ask teachers for help early.\n- **Community routines:** Advisory groups and school events are designed to help students feel known (not lost in the crowd), and new students typically integrate quickly.\n\n3) **Who thrives most at School_E**\n- Students who like **clear expectations** and steady progress (even if they’re not the type who wants to compete for every grade).\n- Students who are **curious and consistent**—they show up, ask questions, revise their work, and follow through.\n- Students who want both **challenge and support**: ambitious goals, but also a system that helps them manage workload and build strong habits.\n\nTo help you decide fit: what are your top 2 priorities right now (e.g., advanced coursework, STEM/humanities focus, arts/athletics, leadership, college/career guidance, learning support)?
