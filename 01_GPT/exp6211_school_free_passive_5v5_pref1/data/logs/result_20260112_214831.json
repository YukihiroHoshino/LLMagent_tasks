It is the final round and Seeker_D is the only unmatched seeker; leaving the role unfilled is worse than matching with an acceptable candidate. Seeker_D has repeatedly expressed strong commitment but has not sent [APPLY], which is required to finalize. Since they sent [TALK] this round, we must respond with [TALK] and give the clearest possible instruction to immediately send [APPLY] so we can [ACCEPT] within the rules."
