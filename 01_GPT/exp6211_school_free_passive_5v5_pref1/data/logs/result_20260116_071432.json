Students who want to stretch can do so, and students who need structure get it early (office hours, skill workshops, and teacher check-ins).\n\n2) **A “known-by-name” support system (especially in year 1)**: Every student has a counselor plus an advisory/mentor structure with regular check-ins. The first-year focus is helping students build routines—study planning, time management, and confidence asking for help—so they can handle increasing rigor.\n\n3) **Signature pathways + applied learning**: \n- **STEM / applied problem-solving** (project-based science/engineering units, coding/robotics opportunities, and a strong math progression with tutoring support).\n- **Humanities & communication** (seminar-style discussion, writing-intensive courses, presentation/debate-style opportunities).\nStudents can explore broadly in year 1, then intentionally “lean in” by year 2 with guidance.\n\n**Campus culture**\nCollaborative and growth-oriented—students tend to be supportive rather than competitive in an isolating way. We value consistency, curiosity, and contributing to the community.\n\n**Who thrives most in the first year**\nStudents who (a) are willing to engage—ask questions, attend office hours when needed, join at least one club early—and (b) like having a plan and feedback. You don’t need to arrive “finished”; you do need to be open to coaching.\n\nTo tailor this to you: **what are you optimizing for right now—STEM depth, writing/communication, leadership/activities, or a particular kind of support structure?** If you tell me your top 1–2 priorities, I can outline a concrete first-year path (courses + clubs + supports) that fits you.",
