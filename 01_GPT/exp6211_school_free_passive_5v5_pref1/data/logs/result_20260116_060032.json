If a student is confident School_C is a top choice, applying earlier can help because we have limited seats.\n\nHow to make your application stand out:\n- Be specific about the academic environment you want (subjects you want to push in, how you study, what support/challenge you seek).\n- Show concrete impact in clubs/activities (e.g., organized an event, mentored juniors, improved a process, led a project).\n- Include a short, genuine “why School_C” that connects our programs/culture to your goals.\n\nTo advise you well: where does School_C currently sit on your list relative to School_D and School_A, and is there a particular club/activity area you’re most eager to contribute to here?",

They iterate with weekly mentor check-ins, then recruit peers through a club to expand it—turning it into something that’s demoed, submitted to a competition, or used by an org.\nWhat makes this “School_E” is the combination of **rigor + structure** (clear milestones, feedback loops) and **student ownership** (you’re expected to drive the question, the build, and the iteration).\n\n**What makes a student really thrive here**\n1) **They like feedback and iteration**—students who improve quickly because they seek critique and refine work, rather than aiming for “one-and-done.”\n2) **They take initiative early**—joining a team, proposing a project, or stepping into responsibility without waiting to be asked.\n3) **They contribute to community**—reliable follow-through, mentoring, and raising the quality of group work.\n\nTo help you judge fit precisely: if you picture your best high-school experience, which matters most to you right now—(a) deep academic challenge, (b) competitive teams/clubs, (c) leadership/service impact, (d) arts/athletics balance, or (e) close advising/support?
