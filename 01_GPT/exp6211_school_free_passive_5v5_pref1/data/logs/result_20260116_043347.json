We emphasize time-management and sustainable routines rather than last-minute cramming.\n\n**What kind of students thrive here**\n- Students who want a school that is **organized and goal-oriented**, and who respond well to consistent check-ins.\n- Students who are motivated but value **coaching and feedback** (not just self-study).\n- Students who want to grow both academically and through activities, and are willing to plan their time.\n\nTo help me tailor details: what subjects are you aiming to strengthen most for the entrance exam, and what extracurricular areas are you hoping to explore (sports, arts, STEM, leadership, etc.)?",
