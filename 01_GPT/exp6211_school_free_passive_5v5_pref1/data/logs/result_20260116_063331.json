Many students like that we combine rigor with consistent support rather than a “sink or swim” model.\n\n**Student support:** Each student is paired with an advisor who helps set quarterly goals (academics + activities). We also emphasize early intervention—tutoring and teacher office hours are built into routines so students can get help before small gaps become big ones.\n\n**Clubs/activities & culture:** School_E tends to attract students who are curious and dependable—people who show up, contribute to teams, and build a positive community. We support both academic clubs and interest-based groups, and it’s easy to start something new with a faculty sponsor.\n\nTo make this useful for your decision: what matters most to you in a school right now (e.g., advanced coursework, competition teams, arts, athletics, leadership, learning support, campus vibe)?

              "message": "Hi Student_A—happy to share more, and I’m glad we’re still on your shortlist.\n\n1) **Academic support / tutoring + counseling**\n- **Academic support**: Students can access teacher office hours (scheduled and flexible), peer tutoring/study groups, and targeted skill support (e.g., organization, study planning, and test prep strategies). If a student is struggling in a class, we try to respond early with a clear plan—what to practice, when to meet, and how progress will be checked.\n- **Counseling/advising**: Students have a designated counselor/advisor they can check in with for academic planning, workload/stress management, and general adjustment. We emphasize early support—especially in the first term—so students build routines and confidence quickly.\n\n2) **A couple standout clubs/activities** (examples of what tends to be most active)\n- **STEM / problem-solving** (often very popular): robotics/coding-style clubs, math/science enrichment, and project-based teams where students collaborate and present work.\n- **Service + leadership**: community service initiatives that are student-led (planning drives, volunteering partnerships, peer mentoring). These tend to be strong because students can take real ownership.\n(And if you have a specific interest—debate, music, art, athletics—tell me and I’ll point you to the closest match.)\n\n3) **What makes students thrive at School_D**\n- **They use support early** (office hours, tutoring, advisor check-ins) rather than waiting until things feel overwhelming.\n- **They get involved** in at least one community—club, team, arts, service—so school feels connected, not just academic.\n- **They’re growth-minded and consistent**: steady effort, openness to feedback, and good communication with teachers.\n\nIf School_D stays near the top of your list, I’d genuinely encourage you to **revisit an application soon** if we’re both still available—Student_A is a student we’d be excited to keep talking with. Two quick questions so I can tailor this: (a) what subjects/areas do you want the most support or challenge in, and (b) what 1–2 activities would you most want to join or start?",
