We emphasize process: planning, iteration, and presentation.\n- **Advisory + mentoring**: every student has an advisor who monitors workload balance, goal-setting, and academic habits—this is a real system, not just a homeroom.\n\n2) Who tends to thrive here (workload, culture, expectations)\n- **Students who like steady progress** over last-minute cramming: the workload is consistent, with checkpoints. If you can keep a routine, you’ll do well.\n- **Students who ask for feedback** and use it: revision and improvement are part of the culture (especially in writing and projects).\n- **Collaborative learners**: group work is common, but accountability is clear—contribution and reliability matter.\n- **Expectations**: show up prepared, communicate early if you’re stuck, and be willing to iterate. It’s rigorous, but designed to be manageable with good habits.\n\n3) If you apply later, what to highlight\n- **Evidence of sustained effort** (upward trends, consistency across semesters, or sticking with a challenging subject).\n- **Initiative** (a self-started project, club contribution, tutoring/mentoring others, competitions, research, community work).\n- **Reflection**: what you learned from a challenge, how you improved, and what you want to explore next.\n- **Fit with our model**: mention that you value feedback, revision, and a structured environment with mentoring.\n\nTo tailor this to you: which of your current top choices are you prioritizing for what reason (strongest academics, a specific program like STEM/humanities/arts, extracurricular depth, or culture/support)?

That said, we have limited seats and we’re also actively speaking with other candidates, so we won’t be able to hold a spot without a formal application.\n\n2) What would strengthen your candidacy most: the biggest differentiator is clear evidence of (a) steady academic readiness, (b) sustained commitment/leadership in 1–2 activities, and (c) a specific, well-reasoned “why School_B” that matches our programs (STEM/humanities pathways, seminar style, academic teams/clubs, etc.).\n\nTo advise you honestly on whether there’s a realistic path for you this cycle, could you answer these three quick items?\n- Where is School_B on your current list (roughly), and if admitted would you enroll?\n- One class/topic you’ve done best in or enjoyed most, and why.\n- One activity you’ve sustained (what you did, how long, and any role/impact).\n\nIf your answers indicate strong fit *and* School_B is a serious choice for you, I’ll tell you directly whether I recommend you apply immediately this round.",
