Students typically have an advisor who helps with course planning, goal-setting, and staying balanced—especially in the first year.\n\n**Signature programs / distinguishing features**\nA highlight is our project-based learning approach: interdisciplinary projects, presentations, and real-world problem solving are common across subjects. Many students also pursue independent projects with a faculty mentor.\n\n**Clubs and student life / culture**\nThe culture is supportive and “hands-on”—students tend to participate in multiple areas (clubs, service, arts, athletics) without a single dominant track. Because the community is tight-knit, it’s relatively easy to take leadership roles early.\n\nTo make this most useful: what are your top 2–3 priorities in choosing a school right now (e.g., STEM depth, humanities/writing, arts, competitive sports, university prep, calm vs. high-intensity culture)?
