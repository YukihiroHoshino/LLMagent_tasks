However, Student_E is applying now and ranks us first, making this a secure fill. Since we prefer any listed student to leaving unfilled and there is no guarantee a higher-ranked student will apply to us, accept to lock in a match."

Teachers coordinate closely so students don’t feel like they’re juggling disconnected expectations across subjects.\n\nStudent support: What stands out here is how proactively we support students—regular check-ins, accessible office hours, and early intervention if a student is struggling (academically or personally). We value a culture where it’s normal to ask for help early rather than “toughing it out.”\n\nClubs & student life: We encourage students to build community through clubs—academic teams, arts, sports, and service. Students who take initiative can also propose new clubs, and we’re supportive when there’s a clear plan and commitment.\n\nQualities we value in incoming students: curiosity, consistency (showing up and following through), respect for others, and willingness to engage—whether that’s speaking up in class, collaborating, or seeking help when needed.\n\nTo help me tailor what to highlight for you: what are you looking for most right now—strong academics, a specific club/activity, a supportive environment, or something else?
