Most students take a common college-prep core, and then we place you into the right **math/science level (standard/honors/advanced)** based on readiness. You can usually adjust level after the first progress check (early in the term) if the placement is too fast/slow. Electives open up more after the first year, but we still try to align choices to your goals.\n\n**(2) Typical first-year support system**\n- **Advisor assignment from day one:** you’re matched with an advisor who does scheduled check-ins (study plan, workload, goals). If something slips, the advisor coordinates support quickly.\n- **Built-in tutoring/office hours:** predictable tutoring blocks and teacher office hours each week—meant to prevent “falling behind” rather than just last-minute test prep.\n- **Early monitoring + intervention:** we run early progress checks and reach out proactively if grades/attendance show risk.\n- **Peer/mentoring touchpoints:** new students get orientation + a peer-support structure (and we can connect you to older students in your interest area).\n\nTo confirm fit fast: if you had to pick **two** priorities, which matter more for you right now—(a) STEM strength, (b) humanities/writing, (c) close advising/tutoring, (d) clubs/leadership, (e) pace/pressure level?
