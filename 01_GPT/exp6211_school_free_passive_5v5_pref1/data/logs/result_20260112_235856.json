Concretely: align stakeholders on the goal/success metric, define scope and milestones, unblock dependencies, and deliver an initial measurable result (even if it’s a v1) rather than letting it stay in “discussion mode.”\n\n(2) Strong vs. weak performance in the first 90 days:\nStrong 90 days looks like:\n- Owns and ships: has delivered at least one meaningful end-to-end project with a clear outcome/metric.\n- Proactive communication: surfaces risks early, sends crisp updates, and drives decisions instead of waiting for them.\n- Good judgment: focuses on the highest-leverage work and can explain tradeoffs.\n- Builds trust: stakeholders feel “this is under control,” and the team would happily give them more ownership.\n\nWeak 90 days looks like:\n- Activity without outcomes: lots of meetings/notes, few shipped deliverables.\n- Needs constant direction: ambiguity stalls progress; waits to be told what to do next.\n- Late surprises: issues are raised only when deadlines slip.\n- Misprioritization: spends time on low-impact tasks while key work remains blocked.\n\nTo sanity-check fit: what’s an example of a recent project where you took an ambiguous, cross-stakeholder problem and drove it to a measurable outcome? If you share that (2–3 bullets), I can tell you whether it maps well to what we need here and what the next step would be.\n\n[TALK]",
