We were impressed by your clear commitment to School_A, and we believe you’ll be a strong fit for our academic environment and community.\n\nIf you confirm, we’ll share next steps for enrollment and orientation details right away. Welcome to School_A! [ACCEPT]",

Student_A is already matched elsewhere or not in the remaining pool, and only Student_B and Student_E remain unmatched. Student_E is #5 on our list and we already rejected them. With quota 1, accepting Student_B secures a very high-priority match immediately with no downside, since no higher-priority student is available now. Therefore accept and reinforce commitment/fit."

School_E is my first-choice school because I’m looking for a supportive environment where I can grow academically and stay engaged through clubs and community.
