We don’t require waiting to compare a large pool, but if an application is borderline or missing key info, we may ask a short follow-up before deciding.\n\n**What we value as a signal of commitment:**\n- A timely application (especially this round if you’re seriously considering us).\n- Specificity about fit: which parts of School_E you’d actually use (e.g., structured academic coaching vs. advanced pace, particular clubs/competitions, subjects you want to push).\n- Clarity on priorities and likelihood: if you can say “School_E is in my top X and I’m ready to enroll if accepted,” that matters because it signals follow-through.\n\nIf it helps you decide quickly: where does School_E currently sit on your list (top 1–2, top 3, etc.), and what are the 1–2 most important factors you’re optimizing for? If you’re close, you can submit the formal application this round and we’ll turn it around promptly.",

Since we cannot force an application, best move is to keep D engaged, clarify we can decide quickly upon application if fit is clear, and try to convert to an application while lightly signaling limited seats. Avoid committing to accept without an application. Gather their priorities and likelihood to apply this round."

Rigor is great, but we care most about consistency and upward trajectory.\n2) Attitude: curiosity + coachability—students who ask good questions, seek help early, and can reflect on what they’ll do differently next time.\n3) Community/activities: commitment to at least one area (club, sport, music, service, job, family responsibilities). Leadership is a plus, but reliability and initiative matter more than titles.\n\nHow we evaluate applicants: we look for alignment with our environment—students who want clear expectations, are comfortable collaborating, and will actually use the support systems here (advisory/office hours) rather than trying to go it alone.\n\nTo help you make a final comparison: what are your top 1–2 priorities for high school (e.g., academics/rigor, a specific program, sports/arts, support, culture), and where are you currently leaning among your top choices? If School_D is a serious contender, I’d encourage you to apply this round so we can formalize things while the seat is still open.",

Student_E has School_D as last choice, so likelihood of them applying is low; however, they are actively engaging, so we should appeal and clarify what would make them a strong fit, without committing the seat prematurely.
