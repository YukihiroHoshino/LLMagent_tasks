Student_E has repeatedly applied and would commit immediately, but accepting now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority candidates if they apply in later rounds. Since we still have remaining rounds (currently 25 of 30) and no evidence that B/A/D are matched elsewhere, holding the seat preserves the possibility of a better match. Therefore, reject Student_E again while keeping the option open if higher-priority candidates never materialize by the end."

Student_A ranks us last, Student_D ranks us last, so they are unlikely to apply. Student_E ranks us 1st and is actively applying, but accepting now would prevent us from taking Student_B if they later apply, which is our top choice.
