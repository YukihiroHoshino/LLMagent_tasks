The only realistic higher-priority threat is Student_B; however, there is no message from them this round and only one round remains. Still, our stated policy and prior rejections have consistently reserved the seat for higher-priority applicants; switching now undermines that and could reduce our chance to match with Student_B if they apply in the final round.
