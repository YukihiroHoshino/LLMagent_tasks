In contrast, at School_E I am ranked 1st, guaranteeing acceptance if I apply now. Since a match locks in and removes both sides, applying to School_E immediately secures a sure match, though it is my last choice. I will first try for a higher true preference. Between School_C and School_A, School_A ranks me last (5th) so it is even worse. School_D ranks me 4th and may be contested by Student_C (2nd there) and Student_A (1st there). Therefore, my best shot at a top outcome is to apply to School_C right away and hope higher-priority students commit elsewhere. If rejected, I can pivot quickly in later rounds, with School_E as a safe fallback where I am top priority."
