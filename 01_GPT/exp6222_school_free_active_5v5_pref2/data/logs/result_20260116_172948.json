Risk: if I accept D now, I forgo the chance to match with Student_B (top choice) if B applies later. Check Student_B preferences: School_E > School_C > School_D > School_B > School_A, so School_A is B’s last choice; unlikely B will apply unless rejected elsewhere. Student_D’s preferences: School_E > School_A > School_B > School_D > School_C, so School_A is D’s 2nd choice; D is plausibly seeking a secure match and is already applying.
