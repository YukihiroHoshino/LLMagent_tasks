Holding out for Student_A is risky because Student_A prefers School_E and School_B over School_D and may never apply. With quota 1, it is optimal to lock in Student_C now rather than gamble for Student_A."

Since higher-priority students (E, B, A) have already applied this round and are willing to commit, accepting Student_D now would block a better match.

To maximize my outcome, I should apply where I have a strong chance to be accepted immediately. At School_E, I am ranked 1st in their priority list, so an early [APPLY] should secure a guaranteed match rather than risk being rejected at School_C and losing time while other schools fill.
