Student_A also ranks School_E first and could apply later, but B is still above A on School_E’s list.

Our quota is 1 and we remain unmatched, but accepting E now would forfeit the chance to match with any higher-priority student if they apply in remaining rounds. Given the market info, Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_A ranks School_C last, and Student_D ranks School_C last; so higher-priority candidates are less likely to apply, but still possible (especially Student_B if not matched at School_E). With rounds remaining and our stated policy throughout the history to hold the seat for higher-priority applicants, we continue to reject to preserve the option value; we prefer leaving unfilled to taking someone outside list, but E is inside list—still, not highest available potential. Maintain consistency with prior rejections and priority ordering."

Higher-priority students (especially Student_B and Student_A) may still become available to apply to School_C if they are rejected by their higher choices (e.g., School_E) or displaced elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now would permanently forgo the chance to match with B/A/D, which is against our objective of matching as high as possible on the true priority list. Since E is on our list, we would consider them only if it becomes clear no higher-priority candidate will apply before the end; at round 28, that is not yet certain.
