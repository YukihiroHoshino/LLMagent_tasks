School_E is my last choice, but it ranks me 1st, meaning an early application there would almost certainly secure a match. To maximize the chance of ending up as high as possible on my true list, I should first pursue better schools and only fall back to School_E later if needed. I will start by talking to School_C to signal strong interest and try to learn what they value before committing an application."

That will help us advise how to present your fit most effectively.",

Since this is only round 1 and Student_E has not applied yet, it's optimal to keep the conversation open and encourage an application while not committing the single seat. Higher-priority students (especially Student_B, who ranks School_C 2nd, and Student_C who ranks School_C 2nd, plus Student_A/D) may approach in later rounds; we should preserve flexibility. Provide general guidance and ask for key info to assess fit and keep Student_E engaged."

Student_E prefers School_C first, so accepting would lock in a guaranteed match, but it risks missing a higher-priority student who may apply later. Given other students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E) and is highly prioritized by us (#1); Student_A ranks School_C last; Student_D ranks School_C last; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after School_D) but is last on our list. School_E is first choice for A, B, D and prioritizes E then B, so B may end up at School_E; A and D likely also target School_E first. Thus, the main upside of waiting is hoping Student_B applies to us if rejected by School_E. However, we have no current application from B, and rejecting Student_E could leave us unmatched if B never comes. Balancing certainty vs potential upgrade, I will accept Student_E to secure the seat with an in-list candidate who strongly commits to enroll."
