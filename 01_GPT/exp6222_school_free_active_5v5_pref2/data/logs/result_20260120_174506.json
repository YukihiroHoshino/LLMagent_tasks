The most realistic higher-priority threat is Student_B potentially turning to School_C if not matched with School_E. With rounds remaining, it is strategically better to continue holding for Student_B rather than accept Student_E now. Student_E has repeatedly applied and is committed, so we can provide a concrete condition: we are waiting to see whether Student_B engages/applies or resolves elsewhere; if that opportunity closes, we would reassess.

Given repeated rounds with only Student_E applying to us, the probability of higher-priority candidates switching to apply to School_C may be decreasing, but not zero.
