However, since the objective is to match as high as possible on my true list, I should first attempt School_C with an early application to see if they will accept; if rejected, I can pivot quickly in later rounds to School_E where I am top priority as a safety. Therefore I will apply to School_C now with a strong, specific appeal."

              "thought": "School_C’s true priority is B > A > D > E > C. Student_E is 4th, acceptable but not ideal. However, by round 6 we have only received repeated applications from E and no outreach from higher-priority students. Given students’ preferences: B ranks School_C 2nd (after E) and may be applying elsewhere; A ranks School_C last; D ranks School_C last; C ranks School_C 2nd (after D). It’s plausible none of B/A/D will apply to us, and holding the seat risks ending unmatched. Since E is committed and within our acceptable list, accepting now secures a match and avoids leaving the seat unfilled."
