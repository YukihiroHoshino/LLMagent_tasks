Because we don’t get formal “matched elsewhere” notifications, we can’t tie this to a single guaranteed signal, but if the market dynamics strongly indicate those candidates have effectively exited, we would be willing to move earlier than round 20.\n\nAs of round 14, we still view at least one higher-priority late application as plausible, so we are **not ready to commit the seat yet**. If you remain unmatched, please check in again over the next few rounds—if the situation clarifies materially, we will re-evaluate immediately.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

Student_E is acceptable but not top-tier; however, no higher-priority students have applied to me across many rounds, and Student_E remains persistently interested. Still, accepting now could block a late application from B/A/D, who all rank School_C relatively high (Student_B has School_C as 2nd; Student_C has it 2nd but is low on my list; others have it 5th). Given the game allows late applications and we’re only at round 14, the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to keep the seat open while continuing to keep Student_E warm via TALK, with an earlier-than-round-20 trigger if higher-priority students appear stably matched elsewhere."
