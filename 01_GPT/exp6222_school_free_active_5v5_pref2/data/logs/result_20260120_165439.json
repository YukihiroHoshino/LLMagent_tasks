At this time, we are not able to offer you admission, as we still need to keep our single available seat open for higher-priority candidates on our list who may still realistically become available to School_C as outcomes at other schools finalize.\n\nOn your request for a general update (without referencing any individual applicant): the contingency is still active—i.e., the market has not yet reached a point where we can conclude that all higher-priority candidates are no longer able to match with School_C. If and when that becomes clear while our seat remains open, we will immediately move to the next eligible candidate under our priority order and respond promptly to any active application.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Our true priority list is B > A > D > E > C, so E is acceptable but below B/A/D. Given full market info: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_D ranks School_C last, Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after School_D) but is lowest on our list. School_E has top priority Student_E and is many students’ first choice; if Student_B fails to secure School_E, they are very likely to apply to School_C. Since we prefer matching with higher-priority students and there is still time (round 23/30) and no evidence higher-priority candidates are impossible, accepting E now would risk blocking B (and possibly A/D) later. Therefore reject E again while keeping door open if higher-priority candidates become unavailable."

However, given all students’ preferences, Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E) and could still apply if rejected by School_E; Student_A ranks School_C last; Student_D ranks School_C last; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd. Since we have not received any outreach from higher-priority candidates to us and we only can respond to current inbox, the key tradeoff is: accept E now (guaranteed fill with a permissible candidate) versus continue holding out for B/A/D who may never come, risking ending unmatched. At round 24 with repeated applications from E and no signals of imminent higher-priority applications, the expected value of waiting further is low, while the cost of remaining unfilled is high. Accepting E also ends our participation but secures a filled seat with an included candidate. Therefore, accept Student_E now."
