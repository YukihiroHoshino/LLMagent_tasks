There is still a reasonable chance Student_B may come to us if not accepted by School_E, so holding the seat preserves the possibility of matching with a higher-priority student. Accepting Student_E now would forgo that upside.

With rounds remaining (17/30) and no other applicants in my inbox, the strategic choice to maximize my outcome is to continue holding for Student_B rather than accept a lower-ranked Student_E now.
