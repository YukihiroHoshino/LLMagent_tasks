School_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched, so we should continue holding the seat for higher-priority students if there is any reasonable chance they may apply. Based on student preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (but is last on our list), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_D ranks School_C last. So the main realistic higher-priority candidate is Student_B; Student_A and Student_D are unlikely to ever apply to School_C, but cannot be ruled out in later rounds. Since Student_E is only [TALK] (not an application) and we are not forced to decide, the best move is to respond transparently without committing, keep the seat open for higher-priority applicants, and indicate we will only move to Student_E if higher-priority options do not materialize by a near-term checkpoint."

However, because Student_B in particular is plausibly still in play (we know School_C is a high option for them, even if not their first), we are still holding our one seat.\n\nThe specific condition that will cause us to move to the next candidate in our priority order is straightforward: if we go the next few rounds without receiving an [APPLY] from any higher-priority student, we will begin making an immediate offer to the highest-priority student who is actively ready to commit.\n\nConcretely: if no higher-priority [APPLY] reaches us by the end of Round 10, we will be prepared to consider you for an offer at that time.

              "thought": "As School_C, my true priority order is B > A > D > E > C, with quota 1. Student_E is relatively high (4th), but I should still hold the seat if there is a realistic chance that Student_B or Student_A (or even Student_D) will apply. From students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after School_D), and Student_E ranks School_C 1st. Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else. Student_B is the key risk: they may try School_E first and then come to us if not accepted; School_E prioritizes Student_E then Student_B, so Student_B might get School_E and never come to us, but I cannot assume that. Given we are only at round 7/30, it is premature to accept Student_E and foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_B (my top choice). Therefore I should continue TALK, be transparent about the condition: we move to Student_E if we receive no applications from higher-priority candidates for a defined window or by a later round cutoff."
