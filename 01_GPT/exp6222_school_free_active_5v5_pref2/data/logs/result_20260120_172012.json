Student_C also ranks School_D as their #1 choice, making acceptance likely to be stable. Waiting for Student_A is risky because Student_A prefers School_E then School_B and may never apply to School_D. With quota 1, accepting a very high-priority, strongly committed applicant now maximizes School_D’s outcome."

Those three students all rank School_C relatively high (B: 2nd, A: 5th, D: 5th), so a direct apply to School_C is likely to be rejected if higher-priority applicants apply. In contrast, School_E ranks me 1st, and several other students (A, B, D) rank School_E as their top choice, meaning School_E will be highly contested; applying immediately can lock in a guaranteed match as a safety.
