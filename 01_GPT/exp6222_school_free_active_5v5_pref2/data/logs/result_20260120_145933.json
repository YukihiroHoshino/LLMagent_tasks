Check students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after E) so likely to apply if not accepted by School_E; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after D) but is last on our list; Student_A ranks School_C last so unlikely; Student_D ranks School_C last so unlikely. Thus the main risk is losing Student_B if we wait too long, but we are early (round 2 of 30) and can reject E now to keep seat open for B. Student_E prefers School_C first; rejecting may lose them, but E is lower priority than B and we prefer leaving unfilled over non-listed (E is listed, so acceptable, but not optimal).
