Applying immediately maximizes my chance to secure my first choice before Student_A potentially takes the only seat.

In this round, only Student_C contacted us, and accepting now secures a very high-priority match within our quota of 1. While Student_A is our top choice, there is no guarantee Student_A will apply to School_D (they rank School_D 3rd after School_E and School_B), so waiting risks ending unmatched or matching with a lower-priority student. Given Student_C’s first-choice status and high rank on our list, accepting is optimal."

Thank you for considering my application.",

Although School_E ranks me 4th (behind Student_E, Student_B, Student_A), applying immediately is still optimal because it is my highest preference and there is a chance higher-priority students commit elsewhere. A direct, motivated application may help if the school has discretion in close decisions and also signals strong commitment early."

Since I can accept only one, I should accept the highest-ranked applicant available now, which is Student_E, and reject lower-ranked applicants. Student_D is 4th on my list and I have higher-priority candidates actively applying, so accepting Student_D would block a better match. Therefore I reject Student_D."
