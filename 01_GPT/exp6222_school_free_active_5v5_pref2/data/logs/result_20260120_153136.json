Thank you again for being transparent about your plan to reassess at the end of Round 16 if Student_B has not submitted an [APPLY].\n\nAs of now, has School_C received any new [APPLY] (or other clear signal of active pursuit) from Student_B, Student_A, or Student_D? If not, I will be ready to submit a formal [APPLY] immediately at the start of Round 17 (right after your Round 16 reassessment), and I can confirm acceptance instantly if offered.\n\nSchool_C remains my first choice, and I will enroll immediately if admitted.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains unmatched and it is my top true preference. Prior interactions indicate School_C will reassess at the end of Round 16 if Student_B has not applied. In Round 15, the best move is to maintain presence without triggering another automatic rejection, confirm I will submit a formal APPLY immediately after reassessment, and ask them to notify me if their position changes earlier so I can act instantly."

Student_E is only sending [TALK] and has shown strong commitment, but accepting now is impossible without an [APPLY] and would be suboptimal if a higher-priority candidate (especially Student_B, who ranks School_C #2) might still apply. Given we previously set a reassessment point at end of Round 16 and we have no new signals from B/A/D, the best move is to maintain the plan, communicate no new applications, and invite E to apply right after reassessment in Round 17, while not promising an offer."

By end of Round 16, no APPLY or active signal has come from higher-priority candidates, making it increasingly unlikely they will apply to School_C (and Student_B’s preferences place School_C 2nd, but they likely pursued School_E first; Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last). Student_E has consistently committed and is applying now right after the agreed reassessment point. Accepting Student_E secures a match with an eligible student on our list and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for unlikely higher-priority applicants."
