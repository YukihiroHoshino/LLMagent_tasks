Given repeated rejections tied to priority/seat status, the best move in round 24 is to stay engaged, request the promised definitive update, and clearly restate my ability to accept immediately the same round if the seat opens—without being overly repetitive or sending another formal apply that may trigger an automatic reject."

However, it is round 26 (late), and only Student_E is currently in my inbox; prolonged delay risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students never engage with School_C (they generally prefer other schools, and only Student_B and Student_C list School_C as 2nd; Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last). Given the late stage and the high likelihood that B/A/D will not come, accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable student rather than risking an empty seat."
