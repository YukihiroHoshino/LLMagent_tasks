However, accepting Student_E now would fill our only seat and block a potentially higher-priority Student_B if they later apply.

So the main threat is Student_B potentially coming to me if rejected by School_E. School_E prioritizes E then B; if E is repeatedly applying to me, E may be failing to secure School_E, leaving B as a strong contender for School_E—meaning B might match with E and never come to me. Student_A and Student_D are very unlikely to apply to me (last choice). Holding out indefinitely risks ending unmatched; accepting Student_E now secures a reasonably high (4/5) priority match.
