Thus the main risk is Student_B eventually turning to School_C if rejected by School_E; Student_A and Student_D are unlikely to apply to School_C unless all other options fail. Since we are only at round 6 (out of 30) and the seat is still open, holding for Student_B is rational to maximize priority. Accepting Student_E now would forgo the chance to match with Student_B, my top choice, who has a plausible path to apply later.

With quota 1 and no other applicants in the inbox this round, accepting E now would lock the seat and foreclose the chance to match with any higher-priority student who may apply in rounds 26–30. Given the school’s objective (maximize rank on true priority list) and that leaving the seat unfilled is preferred to taking someone not on the list (E is on the list), the optimal strategy remains to hold the seat for B/A/D as long as possible. Therefore, reject again this round while reiterating fixed-priority constraint."

However, there is still a non-zero chance that higher-priority students (especially Student_B who ranks School_C #2, and Student_C who ranks School_C #2 but is last on our list) could apply in remaining rounds.

The only realistic higher-priority threat is Student_B. However, we are in Round 27 (near the end at 30) and we have repeatedly observed no applications from higher-priority candidates to us across many rounds. To avoid ending unmatched (worse than matching with Student_E, who is on our acceptable list), it is now optimal to accept Student_E’s committed application and secure the seat."
