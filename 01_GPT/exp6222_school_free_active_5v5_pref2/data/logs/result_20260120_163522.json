I will submit a clear, enthusiastic application emphasizing fit and commitment."

Accepting Student_B now would fill my only seat but would forgo the chance to match with Student_E, who is my top priority and has also applied and indicated readiness to commit. Since I can only accept one applicant and Student_E is available, I should reject Student_B (despite being a strong candidate) to preserve the seat for Student_E.
