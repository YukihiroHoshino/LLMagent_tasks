School_C advised that a new APPLY before round 15 would likely be an automatic repeat, and they plan to reassess at round 15 if there is still no contact from higher-priority students. Since this is round 14, the best move is to TALK: confirm whether any of Student_B/Student_A/Student_D have engaged since the last update, reaffirm commitment, and position myself to submit an immediate APPLY the moment School_C is ready for live consideration (ideally at the start of round 15)."

No higher-priority students have contacted us, but it is only round 14 and we previously gave a clear reassessment point at round 15. Accepting Student_E now would lock our only seat and could prevent matching with Student_B/A/D if they apply in round 15+. To preserve credibility and maximize chance of a higher-priority match, continue to hold through round 14 and invite Student_E to apply at round 15 for live consideration if no higher-priority contact occurs."
