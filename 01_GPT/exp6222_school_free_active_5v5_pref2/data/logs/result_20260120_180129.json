A [TALK] message can keep me active, signal immediate availability, and ask what concrete condition/timeline would trigger an offer (e.g., if specific higher-priority students do not apply by a certain round), without forcing another immediate reject decision."

If we reach the point of making an offer, we may request an official score/grade sheet for our records, but it is not required to keep you under consideration.\n\nWe appreciate your continued interest and will keep you updated.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
