Since accepting Student_E now would end School_C’s participation and foreclose the chance to match with Student_B/A/D, and we are only at round 23 (with up to round 30), it is still optimal to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates. Therefore, reject Student_E again while encouraging a late-stage re-apply."
