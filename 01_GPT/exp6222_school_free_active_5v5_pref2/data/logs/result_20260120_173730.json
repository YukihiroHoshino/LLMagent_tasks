Student_E (my top choice) has not applied yet, but may still be reachable later since School_E is last on Student_E’s preference list; however, Student_B is both high priority for me and has declared School_E as first choice, so I should keep capacity for Student_B (and potentially Student_E if circumstances change).

I still have quota 1, but accepting Student_E now could block a higher-priority student (Student_B, Student_A, or Student_D) from matching with me if they apply later. Given Student_B lists School_C as 2nd choice and could come to me after School_E; Student_C lists me 2nd as well (but is lowest on my list); Student_A and Student_D rank me last, so unlikely but still possible late. Since we are not forced to fill immediately and prefer waiting for higher-priority candidates, and history shows repeated reapplications without any change in our priorities/capacity strategy, the optimal move to maximize my match quality is to reject Student_E again and keep the seat open."
