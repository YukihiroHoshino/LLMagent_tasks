Since I am currently unmatched and only interacting with Student_E this round (TALK), I should not commit yet; I should keep the seat available in case Student_B (or possibly Student_A) applies in a later round. Best action is to be candid: E is still a contingency, and I cannot invite another apply unless I’m ready to accept. Therefore respond with TALK, signaling low likelihood and advising E to pursue other options, while leaving a small possibility if higher-priority candidates do not materialize."
