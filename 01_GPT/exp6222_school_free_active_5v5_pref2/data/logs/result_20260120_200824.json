I’m most proud of improving consistency and follow-through for the group (showing up, meeting deadlines, and keeping plans realistic).\n\nGoal at School_C: I want to pursue a strong academic pathway that lets me deepen my analytical skills (especially through research/project-based work) while contributing to a collaborative community—study groups, peer tutoring, and reliable participation in clubs.\n\nSchool_C remains my first choice because the emphasis on rigor plus collaboration matches how I work best.

The A- (up from B+) in advanced math, the A in lab science, and the clearly quantified outcomes from your 6-week onboarding/planning system are all strong evidence of both rigor and follow-through.\n\nAt this moment, our remaining seat is still unfilled, but we are still holding it while we see whether any higher-priority candidates choose to apply to School_C. I’m not able to extend an offer yet.\n\nIf you would like to be in the best position for immediate reconsideration the moment the seat becomes available, you can submit an [APPLY] to School_C (even a brief one referencing the information you’ve already provided). If the seat opens and you are the top available candidate in our process at that time, we would be able to act quickly.\n\nWould you like to submit an [APPLY] now, or keep this as [TALK] while we wait for higher-priority decisions to resolve?",

Student_E has only sent [TALK] this round, so we cannot accept yet. Given the market, higher-priority students (especially Student_B) rank School_C highly (Student_B has School_C as #2), so we should continue holding the seat for a potential higher-priority [APPLY]. However, maintaining Student_E’s engagement as a backup is valuable; they’ve provided strong evidence and stated they would accept immediately. Best action: continue [TALK], be transparent that we are still waiting on higher-priority applicants, and invite them to submit an [APPLY] if they want to be formally considered immediately should the seat open."

However, no higher-priority students have applied to School_C through round 6, and based on preferences Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (likely aiming for School_E first), Student_A ranks School_C last, and Student_D ranks School_C last—so the probability of receiving a higher-priority application soon appears low. Rejecting now risks ending unmatched or being forced to accept an even lower-priority candidate later; accepting Student_E fills the seat with an acceptable (listed) candidate. Therefore, accept."
