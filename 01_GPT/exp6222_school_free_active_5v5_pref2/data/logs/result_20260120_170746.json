Given quota=1 and round=1, it is likely higher-priority students will apply to School_C soon: Student_B has School_C as 2nd choice (after School_E) and School_E ranks Student_B highly (2nd) but also has Student_E as top, so Student_B may or may not land at School_E; Student_C has School_C as 2nd; Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last, so less likely. Because we only finalize a match upon [ACCEPT] and then exit the market, accepting Student_E now risks missing Student_B (our top choice) if they later apply.

Student_E is acceptable but ranked 4th, so I should only accept if it is unlikely that higher-priority students (B, A, D) will apply and be available. From preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after E), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_D ranks School_C last. School_E prioritizes E first, then B, then A/D/C; thus B is a strong candidate for E and may match there, but if B fails at E, School_C is B’s next choice and B could apply later. Since accepting E now would block a potential match with higher-priority B, and we are still early (round 6 of 30) with no matches yet, it is strategically better to reject E again to preserve the seat for B (and possibly A/D though less likely). History shows repeated applications from E; despite commitment, priority-based objective dominates."
