Student_E ranks School_C 1st and is repeatedly applying, indicating immediate acceptance. However, as long as there remains a plausible path that a higher-priority student (especially Student_B, our top choice) could become available to take the seat, accepting Student_E would block that. With 5 rounds remaining (25 to 30) and no explicit deadlines/commitments from higher-priority students known here, the strategy consistent with prior stance is to continue holding the seat rather than lock in a lower-priority match. Therefore, reject again while keeping door open if higher-priority options fail to materialize later."
