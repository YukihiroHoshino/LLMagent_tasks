With quota 1 and no other applicants in the inbox this round, accepting now secures a very high-priority match. Waiting for Student_A is risky because Student_A ranks School_D third (after School_E and School_B) and may never apply if they match elsewhere. Therefore, accept Student_C."

Although School_E ranks me 4th (behind Student_E, Student_B, Student_A), it is still possible I could be accepted if higher-priority students apply elsewhere or are rejected.

Since I can accept only one and I want the highest-priority student available, I should not accept Student_D while higher-ranked candidates (E, B, A) are simultaneously applying and are willing to commit.

Since we can only accept one and want the highest-priority feasible match, we should not accept Student_A now. Rejecting preserves capacity to accept Student_E (top choice) or Student_B (second choice).
