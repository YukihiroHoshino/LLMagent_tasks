Despite repeated rejections due to priority order, the seat is still open; the only way to possibly secure it is to keep submitting an [APPLY] so that if no higher-priority student applies/commits this round, I can be considered immediately. I will reiterate unconditional commitment and readiness to enroll at once, while respectfully acknowledging their priority constraints."

If you still confirm that you will enroll immediately upon this offer, we are happy to finalize the match.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Our true priority list is B > A > D > E > C, so Student_E is 4th and acceptable but not ideal. However, by round 16 no higher-priority student (B/A/D) has applied to us at all; their preferences place School_C as: B=2nd, C=2nd, A=5th, D=5th. It is plausible B or C may eventually come, but there is no evidence they will, and continued waiting risks ending unmatched by round 30. Student_E has repeatedly applied and credibly commits to accept immediately, reducing risk. Given the late round and persistent commitment, accepting now secures a filled seat with an acceptable-ranked student rather than risking leaving it empty."
