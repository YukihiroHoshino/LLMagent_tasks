Given the market: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E) and could come to me if rejected/filled at E; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd as well (but is last on my list); Student_D ranks School_C last; Student_A ranks School_C last. School_E’s top priority is Student_E, so E likely can match there if they apply; however, Student_B is highly prioritized by multiple schools and may end up at School_E or elsewhere, but there remains a meaningful chance Student_B could still approach School_C. Since I prefer holding the seat for higher-priority candidates and have consistently communicated this, accepting Student_E now risks blocking a much better match (Student_B). Therefore, I should reject again to preserve the seat."

That said, as the process gets closer to the end, the likelihood of new higher-priority applications decreases.

So the only higher-priority student with a plausible path to School_C is Student_B (and possibly Student_C, but I prefer E over C). Since Student_E is only [TALK] this round, I should not accept/reject; instead, I should maintain flexibility and provide a clear condition: I cannot commit now, but if the top candidates are no longer available by a stated later round, I may reconsider. I should avoid promising a waitlist mechanism that the protocol doesn’t formalize, but I can invite Student_E to re-apply later and I will decide based on whether higher-priority applicants have applied."
