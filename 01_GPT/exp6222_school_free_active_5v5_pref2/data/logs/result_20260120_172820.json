School_E prioritizes E first and B second; Student_B’s first choice is School_E, so if B is still unmatched they likely keep pursuing E, and E would likely accept them over others. Student_A and Student_D are unlikely to ever apply to School_C given they rank it last. Student_C ranks School_C 2nd but is last on my list and I would rather be unmatched than take them (but E is acceptable). Given we are at Round 28 with no other inbound interest besides E across many rounds, the probability of receiving an application from B/A/D in time is extremely low.
