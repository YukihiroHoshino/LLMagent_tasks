Those three students all rank School_C relatively high (B: 2nd, C: 2nd, A: 5th, D: 5th), so competition is significant and an early [APPLY] could be rejected. School_E, however, ranks me 1st in priority, so if I apply there I am very likely to be accepted immediately. Although School_E is my last choice, securing a guaranteed match early may be strategically best given the one-shot-per-round constraint and the risk of being crowded out at my higher choices.
