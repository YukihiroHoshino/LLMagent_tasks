From preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after School_D), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_D ranks School_C last. It is plausible Student_B or Student_C could apply later if rejected elsewhere; Student_B is especially valuable as our top choice. Given we prefer holding the seat over taking a lower-priority student while higher-priority outcomes remain possible and we are only at round 15/30, we should continue to reject E to preserve optionality for B/A/D. History shows repeated applications from E; however, our stated policy has been to hold for higher-priority applicants, and nothing in the current round indicates those possibilities are exhausted.
