Therefore, the main risk is filling with Student_E and later losing chance at Student_B. Since no other students contacted us this round, we keep Student_E warm, but do not invite immediate APPLY unless we are ready to commit; however, we can signal that if they APPLY we can make a decision quickly, without promising acceptance.

Likely competition: School_E is top choice for A/B/D; School_D top for C; School_A/B have their own priorities.
