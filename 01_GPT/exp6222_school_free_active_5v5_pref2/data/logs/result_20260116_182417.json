Accepting Student_E now would block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_B (or Student_A) in later rounds. Since I prefer a higher-ranked student and can keep the seat open, and I have repeatedly rejected Student_E already, the optimal move is to reject again this round."

Given Student_B ranks School_C 2nd, Student_C ranks School_C 2nd, and Student_E ranks us 1st, it’s plausible higher-priority students may still approach us in later rounds after being rejected elsewhere. History shows repeated applications from Student_E; however, our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and we still have time (round 9/30) to wait. Therefore, reject again to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates."
