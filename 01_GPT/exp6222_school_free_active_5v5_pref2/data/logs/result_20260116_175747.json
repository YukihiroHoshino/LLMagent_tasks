In round 1, it is strategically better to hold the seat for higher-priority students (Student_A or Student_B in particular), who both rank School_B relatively high (A ranks B 2nd; B ranks B 4th) and may come to us after attempting School_E/others.

Student_A ranks School_D 3rd (behind School_E and School_B), so they are unlikely to apply early and may match elsewhere. Student_C ranks School_D 1st and is committing now, making acceptance likely to secure a very high-priority match immediately.

We previously committed to reassess at round 15 if no higher-priority student applies; honoring that maintains credibility and preserves the chance to match higher on our priority list. Student_E sent [TALK], so we should respond with [TALK] and confirm whether anything changed; per history, no applications/indications from higher-priority students have arrived. Continue to hold seat through round 14 and invite Student_E to check in round 15 or sooner if they learn higher-priority students matched elsewhere."

We’ve now reached round 15, and per your earlier guidance that you would re-evaluate at this point if no higher-priority student (Student_B / Student_A / Student_D) has applied, I would like to submit a formal application for the remaining seat.\n\nSchool_C is my first choice. If you are able to offer admission now, I will accept immediately and withdraw from all other consideration.\n\nThank you very much for reconsidering me at this stage.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",

Given we are now at round 15 and they previously reported no such applications, the best move is to submit a clear, formal [APPLY] with immediate-accept commitment, so they can fill the seat now if they are ready to release it."

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Student_E applied this round. Our true priority list ranks Student_E above Student_C (and we prefer unfilled only over students not on the list). We have held the seat through round 15 to wait for higher-priority Student_B/Student_A/Student_D, but none have applied despite many rounds and we explicitly committed to re-evaluate at round 15. Accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable (ranked) student and avoids risking ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply. Also, Student_E has stated School_C is first choice and will accept immediately, reducing reneging risk."
