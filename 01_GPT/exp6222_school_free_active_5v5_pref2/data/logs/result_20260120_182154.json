Student_C is my #2, and they are applying now with School_D as their first choice, meaning acceptance is likely stable and prevents losing the seat while waiting for Student_A (my #1), who ranks School_D only 3rd and may match elsewhere (School_E or School_B) given their preferences and those schools' priorities. With only one applicant in the inbox this round and high risk of ending up with a lower-priority student later if I delay, accepting Student_C maximizes my expected outcome within quota."

Since Student_B is ranked higher than Student_A on my priority list and is also applying with immediate-commit intent, accepting Student_A now would prevent matching with a higher-priority candidate (Student_B) given quota 1. Therefore I should reject Student_A to preserve the seat for Student_B. No prior commitments exist yet, so this is the optimal move to maximize my match quality."

Given School_E’s priority list (Student_E > Student_B > Student_A > Student_D > Student_C), I am 4th, so acceptance is not guaranteed if higher-priority students apply.
