On School_D’s true priority list, Student_C is ranked 2nd (behind Student_A). However, Student_A does not rank School_D highly (3rd) and is likely to apply first to School_E or School_B, where those schools may accept them, so waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for lower-ranked options later. Given quota=1 and no other applicants in the inbox this round, accepting Student_C secures a strong, high-priority match immediately."

However, School_C’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind Student_B, Student_A, Student_D), and those students have strong incentives to apply there early (especially Student_B who ranks School_C 2nd). If I apply to School_C now, I’m likely to be rejected and lose a round. By contrast, School_E ranks me 1st, so applying there now almost surely secures an immediate match. Even though School_E is my last choice, locking in a guaranteed match prevents ending up unmatched if other schools fill. Given the one-shot-per-round constraint and tight capacities, I should secure the safe acceptance first rather than gamble and get shut out."

Student_E also applied directly to us (even though we are their 5th choice), and an [ACCEPT] immediately secures our top-ranked match and ends our search risk-free.
