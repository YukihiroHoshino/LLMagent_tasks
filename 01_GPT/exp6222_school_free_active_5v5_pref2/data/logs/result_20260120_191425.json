Student_B ranks School_C as 2nd choice (after School_E), Student_A ranks School_C last, and Student_D ranks School_C last; however, the process is only at round 6 of 30, so outcomes at School_E/others may later push Student_B (and potentially others) to apply to School_C. Accepting Student_E now would block any later higher-priority applicant, which would violate my objective of matching as high as possible on my priority list. Therefore, despite Student_E’s strong commitment, I should continue to reject and reserve capacity while the market unfolds."

Higher-priority students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after E) so could plausibly come later if rejected by E; Student_A ranks School_C last so very unlikely; Student_D ranks School_C last so very unlikely. However, Student_B is a realistic threat and could arrive in later rounds, so accepting E now risks missing a better (higher-priority) match. With no evidence that B has matched elsewhere, and we still have many rounds left (up to 30), optimal strategy is to continue holding the seat. Therefore reject E again while keeping door open for later reconsideration if higher-priority options become unavailable."

Student_B ranks School_C 2nd and could still pivot if rejected by School_E, but after 19 rounds without outreach, that probability is diminishing. Leaving the seat empty risks ending unmatched despite having an eager, committed applicant who is on our acceptable list. Given the late stage and no better candidates currently engaging us, accept Student_E to fill quota with a listed candidate rather than remain unfilled."
