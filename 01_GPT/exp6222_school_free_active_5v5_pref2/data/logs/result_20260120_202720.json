Student_E has applied repeatedly and would accept immediately, but accepting now risks foregoing a better match (Student_B/Student_A/Student_D), any of whom could plausibly come to us given their preference lists (B has us #2, C has us #2, etc.). Therefore, reject again this round to preserve the seat."

We still have 1 seat and are currently unmatched, so holding the seat for higher-priority candidates is valuable. Student_B ranks School_C as 2nd and may apply after School_E; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd; Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. However, School_E is highly attractive and may keep Student_B/others occupied, but we have no indication they are unavailable. Given repeated prior rejections and the strategic value of waiting for Student_B (our top choice) or Student_A, we should continue to reject rather than lock in a lower-ranked candidate now."

However, the market has progressed to round 8 with no contact from those higher-ranked students, while Student_E has repeatedly applied and would commit immediately. Given quota=1 and the risk of ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply, it is now optimal to secure a match with an acceptable candidate rather than continue holding out. Accepting Student_E fills the seat with a listed student and ends uncertainty."
