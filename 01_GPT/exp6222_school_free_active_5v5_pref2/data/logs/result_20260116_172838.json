School_C is my first-choice school because I’m especially interested in your academic environment and would like to contribute actively to campus life. Could you share what qualities you prioritize most when selecting among applicants, and whether there are specific programs or initiatives where motivated students can get involved early? I’m very interested in applying if there’s a good fit.",

Meanwhile, School_E ranks me 1st, but it is my last choice; I should only pivot there if needed. In round 1, I will [TALK] to School_C to signal strong fit and interest, aiming to improve my standing/attention before committing an application in a later round if it seems viable."

If you share 1–2 areas you’re most excited about (STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, community service, etc.), I can point you to the best on-ramps at School_C.\n\nIf School_C is truly your top choice, you’re welcome to submit an [APPLY] when ready—happy to continue the conversation as well.",

However, on School_C’s true priority list, Student_E is 4th (behind Student_B, Student_A, Student_D). Given quota=1 and the market: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E), Student_A ranks School_C last, Student_D ranks School_C last, Student_C ranks School_C 2nd, Student_E ranks School_C 1st. Top candidates (B/A/D) may not approach School_C early because they prefer other schools, but Student_B could be displaced from School_E (where Student_E is top priority) and then apply to School_C. Therefore, keep Student_E warm, encourage an application, but avoid committing prematurely; gather info and signal interest without guaranteeing acceptance."
