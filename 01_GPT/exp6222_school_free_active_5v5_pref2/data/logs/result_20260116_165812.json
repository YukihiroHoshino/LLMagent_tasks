              "message": "Dear Student_E,\n\nThank you for your continued patience and for reaffirming that School_C is your unequivocal #1 choice.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_C. Based on your stated commitment to enroll immediately if admitted, we are prepared to finalize the match with you now.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Student_E is 4th on School_C’s true priority list (ahead of Student_C but behind Student_B, Student_A, Student_D). We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. No higher-priority students have applied to School_C through round 15, but they could still do so later; however, continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched if they never apply. Student_E has repeatedly applied and credibly commits to enroll immediately, so accepting now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) candidate rather than risking leaving the seat empty. Given the late stage (round 15) and persistent demonstrated interest, accept."
