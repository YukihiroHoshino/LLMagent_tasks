Based on students’ preferences, Student_B ranks School_C 2nd, Student_C ranks it 2nd, and Student_A/Student_D rank it last—so the most realistic higher-priority threat is Student_B (and possibly Student_C though lower on our list). With quota 1 and no current match, it is optimal to keep the seat open and not signal commitment to E yet. Student_E is only TALKing, so respond with TALK, provide limited transparency, and set a clearer check-in window to manage expectations while preserving option value."
