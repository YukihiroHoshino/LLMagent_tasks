Because Student_B (our top choice) may still become available and could apply to us, accepting Student_E now would risk losing a much higher-priority match. Given the repeated prior stance and that we prefer to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates, we should reject again this round while being transparent that we cannot disclose other candidates’ activity and encouraging Student_E to pursue other options and reapply later if still unmatched."
