Meanwhile, School_E ranks me 1st, guaranteeing acceptance if I apply. However, School_E is my last choice, so I should not lock it in immediately. I will apply to School_A (my 2nd choice). School_A ranks me last, but many top-priority students for School_A (B and D) strongly prefer School_E first, and A prefers E/B/D above A, so there is a plausible path where School_A becomes available and may accept me if higher-priority applicants don’t apply.

Accepting Student_E now would block the seat and prevent matching with a higher-priority student.
