Since we have quota 1 and prefer a higher-priority student if possible, it is strategic to reject Student_E now to preserve capacity for Student_B, who is both higher priority for us and plausibly available if School_E fills with Student_E or others.

We still have an open seat (quota 1) and have not matched yet, so accepting Student_E now could block a higher-priority student who may apply later as they get rejected from their higher choices. Student_B ranks School_C 2nd and may come after School_E; Student_A ranks School_C last but could still eventually apply; Student_D ranks School_C last. Given we prefer a higher-ranked student and there is still time/rounds, it is strategically better to continue holding the seat rather than commit to Student_E now. Therefore, reject again while encouraging Student_E to pursue other options."

School_E prioritizes Student_E first and may accept them if they apply there; however Student_E prefers us and keeps applying, indicating high likelihood of immediate commitment. Holding the seat longer risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply, while Student_E provides a sure match now and is within our acceptable list.
