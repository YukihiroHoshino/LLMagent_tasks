Given we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside the list, Student_E is still acceptable in principle, but only if we believe higher-priority candidates will not apply later. Looking at student preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E) so could come if rejected by School_E; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after School_D) but is last on our list; Student_A ranks School_C last; Student_D ranks School_C last; Student_E ranks School_C 1st and has persisted. By round 19, prolonged lack of applications from higher-priority candidates suggests they may have matched elsewhere or are pursuing other schools. The risk of holding out is ending unmatched, which violates our objective to match as high as possible within quota: Student_E is on our list and is the best available applicant now. Accepting now secures a ranked (though not top) match rather than potentially remaining empty through round 30."
