Given full information, Student_B ranks School_C #2 (after School_E) and is top priority for us; Student_C ranks School_C #2 (after School_D) but is last on our list; Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last, so they are unlikely to apply. In Round 1, Student_B likely applies to School_E first; Student_E applying now suggests we can secure a match immediately, but accepting would forgo the chance that Student_B might come to us later if rejected by School_E. Since our quota is 1 and we prefer higher-priority students, it is optimal to keep the seat open for at least a chance at Student_B (or Student_A/D though unlikely).
