That said, because it remains plausible that outcomes at their higher-ranked schools could lead them to approach us in later rounds, our position is unchanged: we are still holding our single seat for that possibility.\n\nYour plan to check back at round 18 makes sense. Consistent with what we shared, if we reach round 18 and we still have no higher-priority [APPLY] in hand (or if one arrives but does not result in a match), we will reassess immediately and give you a prompt, definitive update.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

The only realistic higher-priority candidate who might still come is Student_B, possibly if rejected by School_E. Since we have no new higher-priority applications in hand and we previously committed to reassess at round 18, the best strategy is to maintain the hold through round 17, confirm no change, and invite Student_E to apply in round 18 for a quick decision if still no higher-priority applicant.

Given our prior commitment to reassess at round 18 and the lack of any higher-priority applications in hand, accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable candidate rather than risking an empty seat. Once we accept, we cannot take a higher-priority candidate later, but the probability-weighted payoff favors filling now given late stage and no signals of imminent higher-priority APPLYs."
