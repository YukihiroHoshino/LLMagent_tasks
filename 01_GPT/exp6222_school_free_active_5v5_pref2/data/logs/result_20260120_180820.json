Still, Student_B is quite likely to apply to us if rejected by School_E, and we should keep capacity to secure a higher-priority match.

Given the market information, Student_B ranks School_C as 2nd and Student_C ranks it 2nd; Student_A and Student_D rank it last. It is plausible that Student_B may apply to School_C if rejected by School_E, and I should preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates (especially B, then A, then D) who could still become available. History shows repeated applications from Student_E, but accepting now would block the possibility of matching with a higher-priority student later. Therefore, I should reject again to keep the seat for higher-priority candidates."
