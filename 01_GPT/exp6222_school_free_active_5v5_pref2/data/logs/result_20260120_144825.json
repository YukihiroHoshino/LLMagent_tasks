Those higher-priority students are likely to apply to School_E first, so School_C may still be contested and I could be rejected. School_E, although last on my list, ranks me 1st, so applying there now secures a guaranteed match and avoids the risk of ending up unmatched if top schools fill. Given the one-seat capacities and competitive priorities at my higher choices, I will lock in School_E."
