In the first two weeks, I would recruit a small group (6–10 students), set a predictable schedule, and create a shared checklist aligned to upcoming quizzes/projects.

Given the market uncertainty and the objective to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should keep the seat available for a reasonable chance at B or A/D, and possibly C depending on their moves.

Student_A and Student_D are unlikely to apply to School_C given last choice. Student_C could apply, but School_C ranks Student_C last and would prefer Student_E over Student_C. Given prolonged vacancy through round 10 and Student_E’s immediate-commit signal, accepting now secures a reasonable-ranked candidate and avoids ending unmatched. Risk: Student_B could apply later; but delaying further risks losing Student_E to another school, and Student_B is likely to match with School_E or School_C anyway, but we can’t bank on it.
