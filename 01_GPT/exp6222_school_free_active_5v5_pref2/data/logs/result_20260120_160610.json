So we’re not ready to convert your prior review into an offer today.\n\nIf the seat is still unfilled after the next round, we can do the waitlist-style reconsideration immediately using the updates you already provided.

              "thought": "As School_C, my true priority list is B > A > D > E > C, and I prefer to keep the seat open rather than commit to a lower-ranked student if there is a realistic chance of attracting a higher-priority applicant. Student_E is 4th on my list. Student_E has been persistent and would accept immediately, which reduces uncertainty, but they have already applied and were rejected earlier. In the current round, only Student_E contacted me, so there is no immediate competition in my inbox; however, given the market structure, higher-priority students (especially Student_B) may still approach School_C because School_C is Student_B’s 2nd choice and Student_C’s 2nd choice, etc. Accepting Student_E now would foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_B/A/D later, which is my objective. Since Student_E is only [TALK] (not [APPLY]) this round, I can continue to hold without making a binding decision, while signaling that reconsideration would require a formal re-application and that timing depends on whether higher-priority candidates appear. Therefore, respond with [TALK], maintain flexibility, and invite a short final check-in/confirm willingness to apply again if we open the seat after the next round."
