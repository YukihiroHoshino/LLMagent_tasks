Since we still have time (round 7 of 30) and no indication that top-priority candidates are fully resolved elsewhere, the optimal strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue holding the seat for higher-priority applicants.

However, those students all rank School_C relatively high: Student_B has School_C as #2, Student_C has School_C as #2 (but is lowest priority for us), while Student_A and Student_D rank School_C last. Student_B is the key risk: they may apply to School_C after failing at School_E (#1) and possibly other options; School_E prioritizes E then B, so B might actually get School_E, reducing the chance B comes to us. Given we are already at round 8/30, but still early enough that holding capacity for B is rational. Accepting E now could block a potential match with B (our top choice) if B applies later. Since we prefer higher-priority candidates and have repeatedly communicated we are holding the seat, the consistent best response is to reject again and continue to wait for B/A/D.
