I’m writing in Round 14 to check in briefly.\n\n1) Since your end-of-Round-13 review, have you received any new [APPLY] to School_C from Student_B, Student_A, or Student_D?\n2) If not, is there any specific “live market” change you would treat as a trigger to stop holding the seat *before* the end of Round 15 (for example, if School_E becomes filled/committed, or if Student_B matches elsewhere), or should I plan on the Round 15 milestone as the next real decision point?\n\nSchool_C remains my clear first choice, and if the seat is still open at the end of Round 15 and you have not received a higher-priority [APPLY], I will submit an immediate Round 15 [APPLY] and will accept and commit to enroll if offered.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",
              "thought": "Only School_C remains unmatched and it is my top true preference, so I should stay engaged and maximize the chance of being reconsidered at the end-of-Round-15 milestone. Since School_C indicated they are still holding for higher-priority candidates and have already rejected my Round-13 APPLY, a TALK in Round 14 is best to (1) confirm whether any higher-priority APPLY has arrived since the Round-13 review, (2) ask what specific market change would trigger an earlier offer before Round 15, and (3) signal that I will submit an immediate Round-15 APPLY if still open—without burning another APPLY this round that is likely to be rejected."

That said, there *are* a few “live market” changes that would cause us to stop holding the seat **before** Round 15, including:\n- If we become confident that **Student_B has matched elsewhere** (or otherwise is no longer in a position to apply to us).\n- If we receive clear market evidence that **Student_B is moving past School_C** (e.g., applying further down their list in a way that implies they won’t reach us).\n- If a **higher-priority student applies to School_C** directly (in which case we would have to act on that application).\n\nAbsent one of those clearer signals, Round 15 remains our planned point to make a final call.\n\nIf our seat is still open at Round 15 and we still have not received a higher-priority [APPLY], we encourage you to do exactly what you outlined: submit a **Round 15 [APPLY]** so we can respond immediately based on the then-current state.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Student_E is on our priority list but below Student_B, Student_A, and Student_D. We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Student_E is only [TALK] this round, so no accept/reject decision is required. Given our earlier commitment that Round 15 is the latest milestone and our belief that Student_B may still apply (School_C is Student_B’s #2), it is rational to continue holding through Round 15 unless a decisive market signal occurs (e.g., Student_B matches elsewhere or School_E becomes unavailable and Student_B starts applying down their list). Provide transparent answers: no new higher-priority applications received; Round 15 remains the main decision point, but we would stop holding earlier if we learn a higher-priority candidate matched elsewhere or clearly will not apply. Encourage Student_E to submit [APPLY] in Round 15 for immediate decision if still open."

Higher-priority candidates are Student_B, Student_A, Student_D. As of end of Round 15, per prior commitments, we should stop holding the seat absent a higher-priority APPLY. There is no indication in this round that any higher-priority student has applied to us, and continuing to wait risks ending unmatched, which is worse than taking an acceptable candidate. Student_E has repeatedly committed to enroll immediately, reducing risk of later unraveling. Therefore accept Student_E now."
