Student_E sent [TALK], so we should respond with [TALK]. Strategically, maintain the seat through Round 25 as previously indicated, confirm reassessment timing, and invite Student_E to check back at Round 26 while keeping other options open."

If not, I appreciate that you plan to reassess at the end of Round 25.\n\nI want to reaffirm that School_C is my clear #1 choice. If you are able to extend an offer at any point, I will accept immediately and withdraw from all other options. If it remains the case that no higher-priority candidate contacts you through Round 25, I will check back right at the start of Round 26 and can submit an immediate formal application then if you are ready to move forward.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",

Please feel free to check back right at the start of Round 26, and if at that point we determine it is appropriate to move forward, we will be ready to respond quickly.\n\nAs always, we encourage you to keep parallel options active until an offer is formally made and accepted.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

Higher-priority candidates are Student_B, Student_A, Student_D. By round 25, none have applied; given their preferences, B has School_E first then us second, A has us last, D has us last—so likelihood of receiving a higher-priority application in the remaining rounds is low. Continuing to hold risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting an included candidate. Student_E has repeatedly committed to accept immediately and is applying now at the reassessment trigger we communicated. Therefore accept to secure a match with an acceptable candidate."
