Risk: if Student_B stays at School_E and Student_C stays at School_D, we may end unmatched, but with full information, Student_B is highly sought by School_A and School_C; Student_E is top for School_E, so Student_E may have other options.

Therefore, the main risk is Student_B (and to a lesser extent Student_C, who is lower than E on my list anyway). Since I can only respond to Student_E now and must choose accept/reject on an APPLY, accepting E would block the chance to take B if B later applies. Given School_E likely attracts Student_B strongly (E is B’s first choice and also ranks B highly), B may match with School_E, but that is not guaranteed. With no confirmation that higher-priority candidates are matched elsewhere, and given repeated prior rejections to preserve the seat, the consistent optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Student_E to keep capacity open for Student_B (and Student_A/D, though they’re unlikely to apply). Also, Student_E asked whether higher-priority candidates have matched; I should respond that I cannot disclose other applicants’ status and that the seat remains reserved for higher-priority candidates."

We appreciate your patience throughout the process and look forward to welcoming you to our community.\n\n[ACTION: ACCEPT]\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions",

At Round 25 end-stage, no higher-priority students (B/A/D) have applied to School_C in this round, and waiting further risks ending unmatched if none apply by Round 30. Accepting E now secures a match with an eligible student rather than risking an unfilled seat; also E has repeatedly stated School_C is first choice and will commit, reducing reneging risk in this protocol. Therefore accept."
