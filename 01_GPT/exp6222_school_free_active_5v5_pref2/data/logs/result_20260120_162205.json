Student_E is the top-ranked candidate and has applied, so School_E should reserve the single seat for Student_E.

My best strategic move is to apply immediately to School_E, which is my last choice but where I am ranked #1 in priority, guaranteeing acceptance and avoiding the risk of ending up unmatched if higher-ranked schools fill.
