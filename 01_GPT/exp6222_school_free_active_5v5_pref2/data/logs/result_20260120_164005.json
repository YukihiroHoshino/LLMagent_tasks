Practically, that means we are continuing to keep the seat under review while we complete conversations with other candidates.\n\nReconsideration would only be possible under one condition: if our seat remains unfilled after we finish that review (i.e., if we do not finalize an agreement with another applicant). If that happens, we may re-open consideration of previously reviewed candidates, including you.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, we strongly encourage you to continue engaging with other schools in parallel so you are not left without a good option.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions",

With quota 1 still open and no other inbound messages this round, it is still rational to keep the seat available to try to attract higher-priority candidates (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) who may approach later given their preference orderings. We have already rejected Student_E twice; accepting now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the chance of a higher-priority student. Since Student_E sent [TALK], we should respond with [TALK], clarify there is no formal waitlist, and be transparent that reconsideration would only occur if the seat remains unfilled near the end of the process, while encouraging them to continue pursuing other options."

Waiting keeps option value for B/A/D, but risks ending unmatched if none apply.
