Since we prefer a higher-ranked student and there is still ample time/rounds, rejecting now preserves the chance to match with Student_B (top choice) if they become available.

Given students’ preferences: B ranks School_C 2nd (after E), C ranks it 2nd (after D), while A and D rank School_C last. There is a realistic chance Student_B may come to School_C if not accepted by School_E; Student_C could also apply, but is lowest on our list. Since the objective is to match as high as possible on our list, we should continue to hold out for Student_B (and possibly Student_A/Student_D though unlikely) rather than lock in Student_E now.
