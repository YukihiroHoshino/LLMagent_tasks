School_E, my last choice, ranks me 1st, so I can secure a guaranteed match there later if needed. To maximize my outcome, I should try for my 2nd choice School_A early: while School_A ranks me last, the top-priority students (B and D) are likely to focus on School_E first, and Student_A’s top choices don’t include School_A until 4th.
