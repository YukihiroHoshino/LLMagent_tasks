Please apply again in Round 30 if you remain available; we will act immediately once the endpoint condition is satisfied.\n\nThank you again for your patience and persistence.",

Higher-priority candidates are Student_B and Student_A (and Student_D). From preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd and may still apply if rejected by School_E; Student_A ranks School_C last (unlikely); Student_D ranks School_C last (unlikely). However, we have no process-verifiable updates clearing higher-priority candidates, and per our stated policy we hold the seat until endpoint unless they apply/withdraw/match elsewhere. It is Round 29 (penultimate); accepting now risks violating our commitment to hold for higher-priority candidates through the endpoint. Best is to reject in Round 29, confirm no updates, and reiterate that in Round 30 if no higher-priority candidate applies, we will accept Student_E immediately upon application."
