Because of that, we cannot responsibly state (even at a high level) that any of those higher-priority students are definitively “no longer active.”\n\nWhat we can say is this: based on the preference lists, at least Student_B could still realistically apply to School_C in a later round (School_C is a high choice for them). That is why we are still reserving our remaining seat according to our priority order.\n\nRegarding your second request—yes, your interest and commitment are clearly noted. If we reach the late-stage point we described (around Round 27) and no higher-priority student has applied to School_C by then, we will be prepared to finalize promptly with the highest-priority applicant who has applied by that time—which would include you.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

We currently have no match and must preserve the seat for a possible higher-priority applicant, especially Student_B who is plausibly still in play if rejected by School_E. Student_E is only [TALK] this round, so respond with [TALK]. Also, we cannot truly observe whether others have matched; even if we had full market info, the prompt doesn’t provide current match status. Best strategy: maintain commitment to late-stage finalization (Round ~27) and confirm their interest is recorded, while being transparent that we cannot confirm others’ match status in real time."
