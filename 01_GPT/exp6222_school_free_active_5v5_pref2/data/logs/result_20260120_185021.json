Student_E (our top choice) has not applied and in their preferences ranks School_E last, so it is unlikely they will apply later unless rejected everywhere else.

Accepting now would secure a match but could block a higher-priority student (B/A/D) who may still be unmatched and could apply in later rounds; since we prefer higher-ranked candidates and have been consistently rejecting E to preserve the seat, the optimal strategy remains to hold the seat for B/A/D unless the end of the process is near or we have evidence they are unavailable. Round 16 leaves ample rounds, so continue rejecting E despite their strong commitment."

We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, but accepting E now would block us from matching with higher-priority students (B/A/D) if they later apply. Given full information: Student_B ranks School_C as 2nd (after E) and is our top choice; Student_A ranks us last; Student_D ranks us last; Student_C ranks us 2nd but is last on our list. It is plausible Student_B may eventually apply to us if not accepted by School_E. Therefore, to maximize our outcome on our true priority list, we should continue to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates rather than accept Student_E now, despite their strong commitment and repeated applications."
