Given the market info: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd (after School_E) and could come if rejected from School_E; Student_A ranks School_C last, unlikely; Student_D ranks School_C last, unlikely; Student_C ranks School_C 2nd but is not in our acceptable list (we prefer empty to Student_C). With 15 rounds elapsed and no higher-priority applicants contacting us, probability of getting B/A/D seems diminishing, but Student_B remains the main threat. However, School_E prioritizes Student_E then Student_B, and Student_B likely can secure School_E if they apply, reducing chance they come to us. To maximize chance of matching as high as possible on our list, we still wait for Student_B; rejecting E preserves option. Since we can continue to reject without penalty and prefer higher-ranked, reject again."
