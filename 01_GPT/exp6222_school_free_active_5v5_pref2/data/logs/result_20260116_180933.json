Likely dynamics: Student_E will apply to School_C (already did) but could also be taken by School_E (its top). Student_B may first try School_E; if rejected due to School_E taking Student_E, Student_B could come to School_C next and we would strongly prefer them. Therefore, rejecting Student_E now preserves capacity for higher-priority Student_B, with some risk of remaining unmatched, but other acceptable candidates (A/D) are unlikely to apply to us.
