Because of that, it is still more likely that our decision will be determined by whether any of those higher-priority candidates formally apply.\n\nThat said, we recognize you have remained unmatched and have continued to demonstrate strong interest.

So the most realistic higher-priority candidate who may still come is Student_B; Student_A/D are unlikely to apply unless late desperation. Since we still have quota 1 and no other applicants this round besides E, the optimal strategy is to continue holding for at least another round or two to see if Student_B comes, while keeping E engaged via TALK. We should not promise timelines but can signal we are still holding for higher-priority candidates and suggest E can apply again if still unmatched later."
