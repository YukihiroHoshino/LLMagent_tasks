I should try for a higher school where I have a realistic shot: School_D ranks me 4th, and while Student_A and Student_C rank School_D 1st, Student_D ranks it 4th and Student_B ranks it 3rd—so competition exists, but there’s a non-trivial chance they commit elsewhere (especially since several prefer School_E or School_C).

Student_D has School_C as 5th choice (unlikely), Student_C has School_C as 2nd choice (after School_D). Given the risk that Student_B could become available later, but no guarantee they will apply to us soon (they will likely try School_E first), we must choose now: accept E (secure decent-ranked match) or reject and gamble for B/C. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our list within quota, and we are allowed to leave unfilled rather than accept outside the list (not relevant), the optimal strategic move is to reject Student_E to preserve the seat for higher-priority Student_B/Student_A/Student_D, with Student_C also possible though last on our list.

We must keep the seat available for applicants who are higher in our priority list should they apply in a subsequent round.\n\nWe appreciate your persistence, and we strongly encourage you to continue actively pursuing other schools on your list in parallel so you do not miss opportunities.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_C Admissions",

Given we are in round 25 with no match yet, but there remains a possibility that higher-priority students (especially Student_B or Student_A) could still apply to School_C (Student_B ranks School_C 2nd; Student_A ranks School_C 5th; Student_D ranks School_C 5th). Accepting E now would block a higher-priority match if one arrives later, which conflicts with the objective of matching as high as possible on the true priority list. Therefore continue to reject E while holding the seat for higher-priority applicants."

Although I am low in School_C’s priority order and have been repeatedly rejected due to higher-priority candidates, there is no other available school to approach in this round.

However, given full market information, higher-priority students are unlikely to apply to School_C: Student_B ranks School_C 2nd but is ranked 2nd by School_E and 1st by School_A, and both schools also highly value B, making B likely to match elsewhere; Student_A ranks School_C last and will not apply; Student_D ranks School_C last and will not apply. With round 26 and no signs of higher-priority applicants approaching, continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched. Accepting E now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) candidate and aligns with objective to fill within quota while still being as high as feasible given realistic availability."
