Practical factors that help us assess fit include: your child’s age/developmental needs relative to the classroom, consistency of schedule/attendance, and alignment with our approach (collaborative family communication, supporting independence, and a calm, predictable routine). If there are any sibling/household logistics or specific support needs, it’s helpful to share those as well.\n\nIf you’d like to demonstrate strong fit, the most useful things to send are: (1) your preferred start date and weekly schedule needs, (2) a short note about your child’s temperament/interests and what environments they thrive in, and (3) any goals you have for the year (social, language, routines, etc.).\n\nIf Nursery_A remains a top option for you, you’re welcome to submit an application when ready and include those details—we review promptly and follow up with next steps.",
