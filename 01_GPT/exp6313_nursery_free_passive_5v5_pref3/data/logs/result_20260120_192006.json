We can usually accommodate a small grace period for pickup if communicated in advance, and we’ll always work with families on occasional exceptions—our main priority is predictability for children and staffing ratios. If you tell me the hours you need, I can confirm whether we can meet them.\n\nMeals & naps: children have a set lunch and snack time; families typically provide packed meals unless otherwise arranged. Rest/quiet time is built in daily—children who don’t sleep can do calm activities while others nap.\n\nKey policies (high level): health/sickness guidance to keep the group well, clear authorized pickup procedures, and regular communication (brief daily updates + periodic check-ins).\n\nWhat we prioritize in families when offering a spot: (1) alignment with a play-based, gentle-structure approach, (2) reliable communication and partnership (especially during the settling-in period), (3) consistency with routines (drop-off/pick-up, sleep needs), and (4) a respectful, community-minded approach.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately: your child’s age, preferred start date window, and the hours you’d ideally need each day.
