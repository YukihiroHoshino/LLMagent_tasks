We typically offer these in the late afternoon (so you can see pickup routines) or a morning window (to see learning/play in action). If you share 2–3 times that work this week, we’ll try to fit you in.\n\nOne quick question so I can advise best: **what’s your decision timeline**, and if Nursery_E ends up being your top choice, would you be ready to **submit an application** right after a visit?\n\n[TALK]",

We can also arrange a quick call or short visit this week to confirm logistics and help with a smooth transition.\n\nWe’re pleased to offer you our spot. ",

Parent_B ranks Nursery_B first, but Nursery_B ranks Parent_B #3, and Parent_A is higher priority. Parent_E is lowest (#5) and was previously rejected. With quota 1, accepting Parent_A now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked parent if Parent_B matches elsewhere. Therefore accept Parent_A and finalize match."

Remaining unmatched nurseries are B, C, E; my top remaining is Nursery_B, then Nursery_E, then Nursery_C. I have strong priority at Nursery_A (1st) but it’s already matched; at Nursery_B I’m 3rd behind Parent_D and Parent_A, so B may be hard to secure if either applies. At Nursery_C I’m 2nd behind Parent_C, and Parent_C’s top choice is Nursery_D (already matched), then A (matched), then B; so Parent_C may apply to B first, and could later come to C, which would beat me. Therefore I should keep Nursery_C warm as a fallback but avoid applying this round to preserve flexibility to pursue B/E. I’ve already asked general questions to C; now I should signal serious interest/availability and ask about likelihood/timeline/next steps to be ready to apply quickly if needed."
