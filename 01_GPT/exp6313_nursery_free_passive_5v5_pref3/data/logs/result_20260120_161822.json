Happy to share.\n\n**What we prioritize (routine & learning focus):** We run a predictable daily rhythm (arrival/free play → morning circle → small-group activities → lunch/rest → afternoon projects). Our learning focus is play-based with strong language development (stories, songs, conversation), early numeracy through games, and social-emotional skills (turn-taking, problem-solving, independence).\n\n**Outdoor time:** We aim for outdoor play every day (typically twice when weather allows). We use outdoor time for gross-motor development, nature exploration, and cooperative games.\n\n**Support for individual needs:** We’re set up for differentiated support—observations, individualized goals, and close communication with families. When helpful, we coordinate with external specialists and adjust routines/activities (sensory supports, smaller groups, visual schedules) to help children thrive.\n\n**Visit/interview steps:** We usually do a short visit (in-person or virtual) plus a brief family chat so we can understand your child’s needs and your priorities. If you’d like, tell me: (1) your child’s age and start timing, and (2) any specific supports or schedule needs—then I can suggest the best next step and available visit slots.\n\nWhat matters most to you in a nursery—outdoor time, academics/play balance, or individual support?",

Staff proactively supports separation with calm coaching and a short, consistent goodbye—no drawn-out exits. We’ll partner with you on a plan if your child needs extra support.\n- Rest/nap: After lunch we do a wind-down routine (story/music, dim lights, comfort items allowed). Children aren’t forced to sleep; we support quiet rest and provide calm alternatives for non-sleepers while maintaining a restful environment.\n\n3) Day-to-day parent communication\n- Daily updates: brief notes via an app/message system (meals, naps, mood, highlights) plus quick pickup/drop-off touchpoints.\n- Ongoing: we share photos/learning snapshots periodically and will schedule a conference/meeting if anything needs deeper discussion.\n- Formal check-ins: at least one structured meeting per term, and additional meetings as needed.\n\nKey steps/dates to stay in good standing\n- The biggest “step” is simply timely application when you feel we’re a fit, because we do fill quickly.\n- If you’d like, share your child’s age and any schedule needs (full-time/part-time, start date).

Based on what you’ve shared (warm environment, clear routines, strong family communication) and your ability to complete steps promptly, we’d be happy to offer you our available place.\n\nNext steps: I’ll send our short enrollment form and a brief scheduling link for a quick family chat/visit (virtual or in-person). If you confirm after that, we’ll finalize immediately.\n\nCould you reply with your child’s age, preferred start date, and the schedule you’re seeking (full/part-time; days)?",
