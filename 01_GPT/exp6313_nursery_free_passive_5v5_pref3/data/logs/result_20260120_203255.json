We balance child-led exploration with gentle educator-guided activities (language, early numeracy through games, art/sensory, and social-emotional learning).\n\n**Supporting transitions for new children**: We use a gradual settling-in plan tailored to each child (short initial stays with a caregiver if helpful, then increasing independent time). Each new child is paired with a consistent key person for the first weeks to build trust. We use visual cues/routines, a consistent goodbye ritual, and regular check-ins with families. If separation is tough, we coordinate a step-by-step plan and keep communication frequent and practical.\n\nIf this sounds aligned, I’d be very happy to review an application from you soon—our single spot can move quickly.

A typical day includes:\n- Outdoor time daily (weather permitting), usually at least one longer block plus an additional shorter period as the day allows.\n- Meals/snacks at consistent times with an emphasis on routines, independence (e.g., self-help skills), and positive mealtime culture.\n- A dedicated rest/nap period after lunch in a calm, predictable environment.\n\nSocial-emotional support: We explicitly teach skills like turn-taking, emotion identification, and problem-solving through modeling, stories, role-play, and coached peer interactions. We use consistent classroom expectations, warm/firm boundaries, and proactive strategies (transition supports, visual cues, and individualized calming tools) to help children regulate and build confidence.\n\nTiming/availability: We do have only one available spot, and interest can move quickly once families begin applying.
