Lunch follows, then rest/quiet time (with a supported nap/quiet routine appropriate to age). Afternoons include small-group activities (art, music/movement, early literacy games), a second outdoor window when possible, and calm pickup transitions.\n\nSocial-emotional approach: We explicitly teach and model skills like turn-taking, naming feelings, gentle problem-solving, and repairing after conflict. Staff use positive guidance, consistent boundaries, and lots of coaching (“what can we do instead?”). We also build independence through small responsibilities (tidying, self-help skills) and predictable routines that reduce stress.\n\nIntake priorities (this year): We follow our published priority order and aim for a cohort that can thrive in a group setting. Practically, we look for: (1) readiness for a play-based, routine-driven day, (2) families who value consistent communication and partnership, and (3) alignment on behavior guidance (positive, consistent, respectful).

              "message": "Hello Parent_E—of course, happy to share more detail.\n\n(1) Settling-in (first 2–3 weeks): We use a gradual, child-centered transition. Typically it looks like: a short first visit with a parent/caregiver present, then a few short drop-offs that increase in length over several days. We keep routines very predictable (same greeting, same key activities, same comfort spot), and we assign a consistent “key person” teacher who is the main point of comfort and connection during arrivals, meals, and transitions. We also coordinate closely with you on what helps your child (comfort item, goodbye routine, preferred words/phrases, sensory needs). If separation is hard, we adjust the pace rather than forcing a fixed timeline.\n\n(2) Day-to-day communication: We do quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up whenever possible (sleep, mood, anything to watch for). In addition, we share regular written/photo updates about classroom activities and reminders (and we can do more frequent updates during the settling-in period if that helps). If something important comes up—sleep refusal, eating changes, repeated tears at drop-off, or a social issue—we reach out promptly the same day so we can stay aligned.\n\n(3) Nap/meal needs & allergies: Yes—within reason we accommodate individual nap rhythms (especially for new children) and we support children who need extra help settling for rest (quiet choices, comfort item, consistent teacher support). For meals, we can work with preferences and developmental needs (e.g., pacing, texture, encouragement without pressure). For allergies, we take them seriously: we follow documented allergy plans, avoid cross-contact, and communicate clearly with families and staff. If you share specifics (type/severity, epi-pen needs, food restrictions), I can tell you exactly how we’d implement the plan.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: your child’s age, any allergy details, and what you’re prioritizing most (hours, outdoor time, language support, temperament/transition concerns). Also—what decision timeline are you working with? If Nursery_E is still in serious consideration, I’d love to help you feel confident about next steps.",
