We may be able to accommodate extended care depending on the day and current staffing/capacity—if you tell me the exact start/end times you need (and which days), I can confirm what’s feasible.\n\n3) Meals/snacks & allergies:\nWe can do either provided meals/snacks or family-packed options depending on dietary needs and family preference. For allergies, we use an individualized allergy plan (documentation, ingredient checks, separation procedures as needed, and clear staff communication). If your child has any allergies/intolerances, please share specifics (severity, epi-pen needs, etc.) so we can assess safely.\n\nWhat we look for most in families during placement:\n- Alignment with a play-based, routine-driven approach (and comfort with social-emotional learning being central)\n- Clear communication and partnership (especially around transitions, behavior support, and any learning needs)\n- Practical fit: schedule reliability and any medical/allergy requirements we can consistently meet\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you share: your child’s age/temperament, any allergies or support needs, and your ideal drop-off/pick-up times?
