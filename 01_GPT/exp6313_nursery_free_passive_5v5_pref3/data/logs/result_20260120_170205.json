We also communicate closely with families so strategies are consistent at home and school.\n\n**Settling-in process:** we usually do a gradual transition (shorter visits at first, then building up to the full schedule) tailored to the child’s comfort and your family’s needs.\n\nIf a place opens, we’d be happy to consider you.
