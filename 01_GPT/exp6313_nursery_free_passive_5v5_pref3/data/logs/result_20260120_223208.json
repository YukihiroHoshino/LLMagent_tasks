A strong-fit application that comes in earlier can be reviewed and decided on sooner, before the seat is filled.\n\n**Key timing / when you’ll hear back**\n- **Applications:** accepted on a rolling basis throughout the cycle.\n- **Decisions:** if there’s a clear match, we can respond **quickly (often within the same round/shortly after receiving the application)** rather than waiting until the end.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, I can tell you candidly how quickly we could move:\n- What **schedule** do you need (days/hours) and what’s your **preferred start date**?\n- Are there any constraints we should know (pickup times, commute, sibling needs)?\n- Which other nurseries are you prioritizing, and what’s your decision timeline?\n\nIf Nursery_E could be near the top of your list, we’d encourage you to apply soon so we can seriously consider you while the seat is still open.",

If you want to lock this in **in Round 30**, please reply immediately with **[APPLY]**, and we will respond right away with **[ACCEPT]**.\n\n**Exact next steps (as requested):**\n1) **Deposit amount + payment method/link:** **No deposit is required** to issue acceptance in this process (no payment link).\n2) **Required documents:** **None required before acceptance.** After we send **[ACCEPT]**, we will request standard enrollment details (parent/child ID info, emergency contacts, medical/allergy information, and authorized pick-up list).\n3) **Confirmed start date:** We will confirm the start date you specify in your **[APPLY]**. If you want us to set a default: **next business day** start, pending your confirmation of days/hours.\n4) **Acceptance deadline:** To finalize in the simulation, please send **[APPLY] now (within Round 30)**; we will issue **[ACCEPT]** immediately upon receipt.\n\nIn your **[APPLY]**, please include: (a) preferred start date, (b) days/hours needed (full-time/part-time), and (c) any support needs/considerations.",
              "thought": "Parent_E is on our true priority list (4th of 5) and we still have 1 open seat in the final round with no other unmatched parents available. Accepting Parent_E is strictly better than ending unmatched. However, platform rules only allow a formal [ACCEPT] after the parent sends [APPLY]. Therefore, provide a firm written offer with all requested next steps and explicitly instruct them to send [APPLY] immediately so we can return [ACCEPT] within the round."
