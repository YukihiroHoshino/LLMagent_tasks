We plan schedules to minimize mid-year changes and use familiar float/support staff (rather than rotating unfamiliar substitutes) whenever possible.\n\n2) Settling-in / separation support\n- Gradual transition: We typically use a phased settling-in plan (short visits with a parent/caregiver, then short independent stays, building up to a full session).\n- Predictable routines: We use consistent arrival routines, a clear goodbye ritual, and comfort objects if helpful.\n- Communication: We’ll update you during the first days/weeks (quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up and brief messages as needed) so you know how your child is doing, especially around separation.\n\n3) Outdoor time & sick-day policy\n- Outdoor time: Outdoor play is built in daily (weather permitting). If weather is unsafe (e.g., severe conditions), we replace it with active indoor movement and gross-motor play.\n- Sick days: We ask families to keep children home when they have a fever, vomiting/diarrhea, or symptoms that suggest they’re contagious or not well enough to participate comfortably. We also follow standard return-to-school guidance (e.g., symptom improvement and fever-free for a defined period without medication). If you tell me what you’re most concerned about (frequent colds, allergies, etc.), I can be more specific about how we handle those.\n\nIf you’re willing to share, what are your child’s age and temperament around separation (slow-to-warm, generally adaptable, etc.)?
