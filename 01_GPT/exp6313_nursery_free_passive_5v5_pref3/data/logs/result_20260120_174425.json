We also like to align early on about goals (e.g., toilet learning, separation support) so home and school feel consistent for your child.\n\nFit criteria (beyond the formal priority list)\nWe don’t have “hidden” requirements, but we do look for practical fit: (1) alignment on routine and guidance approach, (2) open communication and partnership with families, and (3) the child’s comfort with a group setting (we support transitions, but it helps to plan together).\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: what are you hoping your child gets most from nursery this year (structure, language development, social confidence, etc.)?

I’m happy to share how our admissions typically works and what we look for.\n\nAdmissions factors we prioritize (in plain terms):\n- Child’s needs and fit with our environment (comfort with a play-based routine, readiness for group care, any supports that help your child thrive).\n- Family alignment with our approach (collaborative communication, consistency around routines, positive partnership).\n- Schedule fit (days/hours needed) and start date.\n- When applicable: sibling/continuity considerations and our ability to maintain balanced groups.\n\nTimeline / offers:\n- We review inquiries on a rolling basis and invite families to a short visit/chat when possible.\n- If you submit an application, we can usually give a clear answer within about 1–2 rounds of conversations here (so you’re not left waiting), assuming we have the information we need.\n- Once an offer is made, we typically ask for a prompt confirmation so we can plan staffing and the classroom mix.\n\nWhat helps a family be a strong fit (what to share):\n- Your child’s age and temperament, and any transition considerations (e.g., first time in group care, separation anxiety, nap needs).\n- The schedule you need (full-day vs part-day, specific days).\n- Your priorities (outdoor time, language exposure, gentle transitions, social-emotional support, etc.).\n- Anything you want us to know to support your child well from day one.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you tell me: (1) your child’s age, (2) ideal start date, and (3) the schedule you need? If Nursery_E might be a contender, I can also outline the exact next step to apply in the next round.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is #2 on Nursery_E’s true priority list, so it’s important to actively appeal and keep them engaged toward an application. Parent_C currently ranks Nursery_E last in their stated preferences, so they may be unlikely to apply unless persuaded; however, providing clear admissions criteria, timeline, and fit signals could move us up. Since they sent [TALK], respond with [TALK], highlight strengths, and ask targeted questions to identify needs and prompt a visit/application soon while keeping flexibility given quota=1."

Based on what you shared, Nursery_E does sound like a strong fit, and we do have capacity to offer you a place.\n\nDaily rhythm (typical):\n- Arrival & settling-in/free play\n- Morning circle (songs, language, routine preview)\n- Small-group activities (early literacy/numeracy through play, art/sensory)\n- Outdoor time (we aim for daily outdoor play, weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/nap or quiet-time (with calm options for children who don’t sleep)\n- Afternoon choice centers + story time and pick-up\n\nHow we help new children settle in:\n- A consistent key-person approach so your child has a familiar adult anchor.\n- Gradual transition when helpful (shorter early days if your schedule allows), with clear goodbye routines.\n- Predictable classroom routines and lots of communication in the first weeks (quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up and proactive updates if anything comes up).\n\nIf you’re ready, please reply next round confirming (1) your child’s age, (2) preferred schedule (full-day/part-day and days), and (3) any allergies or support needs we should plan for. We’ll then lock in the start plan together.\n\nWe’d be happy to welcome your family to Nursery_E.",

However, only Parent_C and Parent_D remain unmatched in round 3, and Nursery_E has quota 1 and no current match. Parent_C is ranked higher (2nd) and has previously engaged with [TALK], so there is a chance to secure Parent_C later. Also, Parent_D ranks Nursery_E as 4th choice (behind C, A, B), so Parent_D may be less stable and could later match elsewhere if not accepted now. Given we can’t hold a tentative spot and risk ending unmatched, and Parent_D is on our acceptable list, accepting now secures a match within quota. Decision: ACCEPT Parent_D while providing program details and onboarding info."
