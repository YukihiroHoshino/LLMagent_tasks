I’m glad to clarify, and based on what you’ve shared so far, Nursery_D could be a strong fit.\n\nCore hours & flexibility:\n- Our core day runs 8:30–15:30.\n- We offer flexible drop-off from 8:00–9:00 and pick-up from 15:30–16:30 (we ask families to keep a consistent “usual” time once settled, but we can accommodate occasional variations).\n\nNap/rest time:\n- We have a daily rest/quiet block after lunch.\n- Children who nap are supported with a calm routine (dim lights, individual mats, comfort items if helpful).\n- Children who don’t sleep are not forced to; we support quiet activities (books, puzzles, drawing) while maintaining a restful environment for sleepers.\n\nOutdoor play:\n- We plan for outdoor time every day, weather permitting—typically one longer block plus an additional shorter outdoor break when the day allows.\n- If weather is genuinely unsafe, we switch to indoor gross-motor activities.\n\nTransitions & behavior guidance:\n- Transitions: we use predictable cues (songs, visual cards, timers) and “previewing” (e.g., ‘two more minutes, then clean-up’), plus small helper roles and choices to reduce power struggles.\n- Guidance: we focus on positive reinforcement, clear and consistent boundaries, coaching children through emotions, and teaching replacement skills (asking for a turn, using words, taking space). We intervene early for safety, and we follow up with repair (helping children make amends) rather than punitive measures.\n- For children who need extra support, we coordinate closely with families on consistent language and strategies.\n\nIf these logistics work for you, I’d genuinely encourage you to submit an application soon so we can move forward while we still have availability. If you share your child’s age and ideal start date (and whether they typically nap), I can also confirm what schedule would fit best on our side.",
