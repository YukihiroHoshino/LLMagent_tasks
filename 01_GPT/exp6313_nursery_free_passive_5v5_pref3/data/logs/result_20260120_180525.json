Current unmatched parents are A, C, E; B and D appear matched elsewhere, so the best remaining candidate on our list is Parent_A (ranked above E). Since Parent_E is only TALKing now, we should keep them warm without committing, and use this chance to elicit whether we are their true first choice and any constraints, while we attempt to secure Parent_A. Do not accept unless they APPLY and we decide no better option is feasible."
