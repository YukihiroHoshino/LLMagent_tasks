We adapt the schedule to the children’s ages and energy levels.\n\nStaff-to-child ratio: We maintain a low ratio with consistent key staff in each room so children see familiar adults throughout the day. The exact ratio varies by age group and time of day; if you tell me your child’s age, I can share the typical staffing for that room.\n\nSupporting transitions: We use a gradual settling-in plan (short initial visits with a parent/caregiver, then increasing independent time), a key-person approach for attachment and communication, and consistent routines/visual cues. We also coordinate closely with families on comfort items, nap routines, and any separation concerns.\n\nIf you’d like, share your child’s age, start date you’re considering, and what matters most to your family (e.g., outdoor time, language support, allergies, nap needs).

At round 3, only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched, so securing A now is important to avoid ending up at my last choice (E). Also, Nursery_A’s priority ranks me 4th, but the higher-priority parents (B, D, A) likely matched elsewhere already given their preferences, so my acceptance chances are decent. I previously only [TALK]ed with Nursery_A, so I can still submit a formal application now."

We’re pleased to offer your family our available place at Nursery_A. Next steps: we’ll send the enrollment packet and deposit/payment details today; once returned, we’ll schedule a brief onboarding meeting and confirm your child’s start date and daily drop-off/pick-up arrangements. Congratulations, and we look forward to welcoming you.",

With quota 1 and only Parent_A and Parent_E remaining unmatched, accepting Parent_E now secures a match rather than risking ending unfilled. Parent_A was previously rejected and is ranked higher than Parent_E, but there is no guarantee Parent_A will re-apply or that we can reach agreement within remaining rounds. Given Parent_E’s readiness to commit immediately, accept to lock in a satisfactory match."
