We focus on social-emotional skills, language development, independence, and curiosity.\n\n**Typical daily rhythm (example):**\n- Arrival & settling in (choice play, greetings)\n- Morning meeting (songs, calendar/weather, sharing)\n- Learning centers / small groups (teacher-facilitated)\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon centers / project time\n- Snack\n- Outdoor play / closing circle\n- Pick-up\n\n**Transitions support:** We use predictable routines, visual cues (pictures/schedules), advance warnings (“5 minutes until clean-up”), and consistent transition songs/phrases. For new starters, we can do a gradual phase-in plan when helpful, and we assign a key staff member to help the child build comfort and attachment.\n\n**Communication with families:** Daily check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when possible, plus regular updates (highlights, routines, and any concerns). For bigger topics (behavior, sleep, toileting, developmental goals), we schedule a quick call or meeting so we can partner closely and stay consistent between home and school.\n\n**Core hours & flexibility:** Our core program runs **9:00–3:00**. We typically can accommodate **early drop-off from 8:00** and **late pick-up until 5:30**, subject to availability.\n\nIf you share (1) your child’s age, (2) the schedule you’re aiming for (core only vs. early/late), and (3) any transition or communication preferences, I can confirm fit more precisely.

If applicable, we also consider siblings/alignment with our community values, but the main driver is ensuring we can genuinely support your child well.\n\nOn timing flexibility: we can hold conversations and review promptly, but we can’t reserve the only spot for long without an application, simply because interest tends to move fast.\n\nIf you’re comfortable, could you share (1) your child’s age, (2) your ideal start date, and (3) your earliest drop-off/latest pick-up?

We’re happy to offer you our available spot.\n\nNext steps: please send (1) your child’s date of birth, (2) your preferred schedule (core 9:00–3:00 and whether you need early drop-off/late pick-up), and (3) any relevant medical/allergy or support notes we should be aware of. We’ll then share the enrollment packet and confirm a start timeline.\n\nWe’re excited to welcome your family to Nursery_D.",

With quota 1 and no current match, accepting Parent_C now secures a high-priority, stable match. Waiting risks losing them to another nursery if they apply elsewhere; although Parent_D is ranked higher, we do not have an application from Parent_D yet, so locking in Parent_C is strategically sound."
