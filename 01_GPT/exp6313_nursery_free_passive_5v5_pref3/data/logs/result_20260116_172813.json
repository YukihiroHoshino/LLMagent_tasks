I’m glad to hear you’re ready to move quickly.\n\nStart date: we can often accommodate a range of start dates (including a phased/gradual start) depending on the exact opening and your child’s transition needs. If you share your ideal start month/week and any flexibility, I can advise more precisely.\n\nDaily schedule (typical):\n- Arrival & free play/settling-in\n- Morning circle (songs/stories/social-emotional routines)\n- Learning-through-play centers (language, early numeracy, sensory, art)\n- Outdoor play (weather permitting)\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon small-group activities and free play\n\nPaperwork / materials: to move forward quickly, we generally ask for a completed application form plus basic child details (DOB), your preferred schedule (full-time/part-time), start-date preference, and any relevant medical/allergy information. If offered a place, we then finalize enrollment forms and any required health documentation.\n\nDecision timeline: we review on a rolling basis and can make decisions quickly once we have your application details and confirm the opening.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can guide next steps:\n1) What start date are you aiming for (and how flexible are you)?\n2) Do you need full-time or part-time days?\n3) Your child’s age/date of birth?\n\nIf you’d like, you can submit your application right away and we’ll prioritize reviewing it in the next decision window.",
