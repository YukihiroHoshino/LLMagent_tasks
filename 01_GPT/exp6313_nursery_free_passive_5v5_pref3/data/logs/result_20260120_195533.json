We keep transitions predictable so children feel secure, but we avoid a “worksheet-style” day.\n\nPolicies & day flow (typical):\n- Outdoor time: Daily (weather permitting), usually at least one longer outdoor block plus shorter walks/play.\n- Meals: Families provide lunch/snacks; we’re nut-aware and ask families to follow our allergy guidelines. Water available throughout the day.\n- Nap/rest: After lunch we have a quiet rest window; children who don’t sleep can do calm activities.\n\nHours/aftercare: Our standard day runs 8:30–15:30.

If you tell me the exact days/times you need, I can confirm whether we can accommodate.\n\nSettling-in support:\n- We use a gradual, child-centered settling plan (shorter initial stays building up over several days).\n- Consistent key-person check-ins and daily communication so home and school can align on routines.\n- We pay close attention to separation cues and adjust pacing to help children feel secure.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applications:\n- Fit with our play-based approach and willingness to partner on consistent routines/communication.\n- Practical schedule reliability (so the child can build a stable rhythm).\n- A clear commitment/timeline—because we cannot hold the spot for long without it.\n\nTo help you decide whether Nursery_E could move up your shortlist: what are your top 2–3 must-haves (hours, location, pedagogy, outdoor time, etc.) and, realistically, how soon could you apply if it felt like a strong fit?

So yes—if you submit a formal application this round and it’s a clear fit, we may offer immediately rather than waiting to compare across many rounds. We also can’t “hold” the spot without a confirmed application/commitment, since interest tends to move quickly.\n\n2) Key factors we prioritize when selecting among families:\n- Schedule fit & reliability: the days/hours you need (including any early drop/aftercare) and confidence that attendance will be consistent.\n- Program fit: comfort with a play-based approach and predictable routines.\n- Communication partnership: responsiveness and alignment on supporting routines/settling-in.\n- Start date & readiness: when you’d like to start and any constraints that affect a smooth transition.\nLocal ties can be a positive signal of stability, but they’re not a primary deciding factor compared with the fit points above.\n\nIf Nursery_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply this round rather than next to avoid missing the window.

I should clarify selection factors: schedule reliability, fit with play-based approach, communication partnership, and readiness/settling; local ties can be a plus but not primary.
