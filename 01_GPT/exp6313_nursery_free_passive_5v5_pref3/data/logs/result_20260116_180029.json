Practically, that looks like:\n- Consistent routines and clear, kind boundaries\n- Coaching language (“I see you’re upset… let’s find a safe way to show it”)\n- Guided peer conflict resolution (turn-taking, repairing, using words)\n- Positive reinforcement and modeling, rather than punitive approaches\nWe also collaborate with families on any specific goals (separation anxiety, transitions, peer dynamics).\n\n**Family partnership & communication (what we value most):**\nWe do best when communication is **proactive, two-way, and aligned**. Families can expect:\n- Regular updates on meals/rest/activities and notable moments\n- Quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when possible\n- Clear policies around health/illness and routines\n- Early communication if we notice patterns (sleep difficulties, social challenges, etc.) so we can address them together\n\nIf this sounds like the kind of environment you’re looking for, I’d love to learn a bit about your child (age, temperament/interests) and the schedule you need (full-day/part-time).
