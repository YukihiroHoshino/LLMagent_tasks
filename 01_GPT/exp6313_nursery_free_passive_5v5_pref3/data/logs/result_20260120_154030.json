We use guided play and small-group activities to build early literacy/numeracy foundations, social-emotional skills, and independence (routines, turn-taking, self-help). We balance child-led exploration with teacher-facilitated projects.\n\n**Typical daily flow (example):**\n- Arrival & settling-in / free play\n- Morning circle (songs, stories, sharing)\n- Learning centers / small groups (art, sensory, pre-literacy, math games)\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon centers / project time\n- Snack & pick-up\n\n**Drop-off / pick-up flexibility:** We have a standard drop-off and pick-up window, and we can usually accommodate a modest buffer if we know in advance (e.g., commute constraints). Frequent late pick-ups are harder due to staffing ratios, but occasional exceptions are workable with communication.\n\n**What we prioritize in applications:** We don’t use a single factor like “commute” as a strict rule. We mainly look for (1) fit with our program/routines, (2) readiness/support needs we can meet well, and (3) family commitment/likelihood of enrolling if offered a seat. If a family has schedule constraints, we just want clarity upfront so we can confirm we can support them.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise next steps:\n1) What drop-off/pick-up times do you need most days?\n2) If offered a seat here, how likely are you to enroll (are we your #1 or among a few)?\n\nIf after this you feel aligned, I’d encourage you to **apply as soon as you’re ready**, since we have one seat and we review applications as they come in during the rounds.",
