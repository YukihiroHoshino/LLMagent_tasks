We keep transitions calm and give children choice within structure.\n\nApproach to learning/play: Play-based and developmentally appropriate, with educators observing children’s interests and planning activities that build language, self-regulation, early numeracy, and social skills.

We’d be happy to share more.\n\n**Daily routine & curriculum:** Our day is structured but play-based, with a consistent rhythm: welcoming/free play, a short morning circle (songs, stories, early language), small-group activities (early literacy, numeracy through games, art/sensory), outdoor time, lunch/rest, and an afternoon project/free-choice period. We focus on social-emotional development, communication, and independence, with activities adapted to each child’s stage.\n\n**Settling-in support:** We use a gradual transition plan tailored to the child—typically a few shorter visits at first, a consistent key-person approach, and close communication with you on routines (comfort items, nap needs, separation strategies). We aim for predictable hand-offs and will adjust pacing if a child needs more time.\n\n**Drop-off/pick-up flexibility:** We can usually accommodate a reasonable window for drop-off and pick-up; specifics depend on the schedule you need. If you share your typical times, I can confirm what we can support.\n\n**What we value when considering families:** We prioritize strong alignment on partnership—clear communication, consistency between home and nursery routines where possible, and a shared commitment to supporting the child’s wellbeing and social development.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what are your child’s age and temperament (e.g., slow-to-warm vs. very outgoing), and what drop-off/pick-up window would you need? If Nursery_A feels like a strong fit after this, you’re very welcome to apply.",

Our child does well with a consistent routine and enjoys outdoor play; we’re happy to share any details you need right away (nap/meals, allergies/medical info, schedule needs, temperament) and can arrange a quick call/visit at your convenience. If you’re able to offer a place, we’re ready to accept immediately.",

Likely Parent_D is matched already (top priority for several nurseries), and Parent_A likely matched too, leaving me with a strong chance if I apply immediately.
