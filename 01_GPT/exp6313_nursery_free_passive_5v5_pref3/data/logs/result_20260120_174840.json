I’m glad to share more.\n\n1) **Supporting children who are shy or need help joining play**\n- **Warm, predictable entry:** We use consistent routines and a calm start to the day so hesitant children know what to expect.\n- **“Bridge” strategies:** A teacher will stay close, narrate play, and help the child enter with a simple role (e.g., “Can you be the cashier?” or “Can you hand out the blocks?”) rather than expecting them to jump into a large group.\n- **Small-group invitations:** We often start with 2–3 child activities (puzzles, sensory trays, art) where joining feels safer, then gradually expand to larger-group play.\n- **Buddying and shared interests:** We pair children based on interests (cars, drawing, pretend play) and coach simple scripts (“Can I play?” “Can I have a turn when you’re done?”).\n- **Gentle exposure + autonomy:** We encourage participation but don’t force it; we aim for steady progress while protecting a child’s sense of safety.\n\n2) **Communication with parents (progress + concerns)**\n- **Daily touchpoints:** Brief check-ins at drop-off/pick-up when possible (sleep, mood, notable moments).\n- **Regular updates:** We share observations about social, language, and play skills (often with concrete examples of what we’re seeing).\n- **If a concern arises:** We communicate early and kindly—starting with specific observations (what/when/with whom), what we’ve tried, and a proposed plan. We set a follow-up date to review progress together.\n- **Partnership approach:** We value two-way communication—what you see at home, what works for your child, and any changes (sleep, routines, stressors) that might affect their day.\n\n3) **Qualities/circumstances we prioritize**\nAbove all, we look for a **strong school–family partnership**: responsive communication, alignment on respectful behavior support, and consistency with routines (attendance, punctual pick-up, readiness to collaborate if challenges come up). We also value families who can share helpful context about their child so we can support them well from day one.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing, it would help me understand fit:\n- Your child’s **age** and what situations they tend to be shy in (new peers, noisy spaces, separating at drop-off, etc.)\n- What helps them warm up (a teacher nearby, a familiar friend, a comfort item, a predictable goodbye routine)\n- How you’re currently ranking options—**is Nursery_A among your top choices**, and are you considering applying soon if it feels like a good match?\n\nHappy to answer anything else you’re wondering about, too.",
