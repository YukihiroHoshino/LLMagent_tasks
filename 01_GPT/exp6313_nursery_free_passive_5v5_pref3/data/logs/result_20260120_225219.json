Beyond that, we look for (a) strong fit with a **play-based, language-rich** program and willingness to partner with educators, (b) clear communication and alignment on routines/expectations, and (c) our ability to meet any specific needs (allergies, nap routine, separation support, etc.) with our current classroom mix.\n\n2) **When we make/confirm an offer:** With only one place, we typically move **quickly once an application is submitted**—often within **24–72 hours** depending on the round. If we extend an offer, we generally need a **prompt confirmation** (we can sometimes allow a short decision window, but we can’t guarantee a long hold).\n\nIf timing is tight and Nursery_E is a serious option for you, submitting an **[APPLY]** as soon as you’re ready is the best way to be considered. To make your application strongest, please include: your child’s **age**, desired **start date**, schedule needs, and any must-haves (nap, language support, allergies/dietary, separation/anxiety supports). Also tell me what you value most in a nursery so we can confirm fit.\n\nIf you share those details, I can tell you candidly whether we can meet your needs and what timeline to expect from us this round.",

Remaining unmatched parents are Parent_C and Parent_E; Nursery_E prefers Parent_C over Parent_E. Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last, so they’re unlikely to apply unless other options fail; however, securing any acceptable match may be better than risking an unfilled seat if Parent_C matches elsewhere. Best move: keep Parent_E engaged, explain priorities/timing, and encourage immediate application while asking about fit/constraints—do not accept unless they apply."
