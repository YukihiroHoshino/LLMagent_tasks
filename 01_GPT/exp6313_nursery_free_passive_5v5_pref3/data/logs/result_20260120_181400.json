We also prioritize a smooth transition period at the start.\n\nOn availability: we have limited places (very small cohort), but we do expect to be able to offer a place to a strong-fit family this cycle. If Nursery_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready and share any priorities (schedule needs, start date, any support needs) so we can confirm fit.\n\nWhat matters most to you in a nursery—learning style, hours, location, or something else?",
