Teachers pull small groups for targeted support while others play/learn in centers.\n- **Snack + transition:** hygiene routines and helping set/clean up.\n- **Outdoor time (45–60 min):** gross-motor play, nature exploration, and group games when appropriate.\n\n**Outdoors vs. indoors:** We aim for **at least one substantial outdoor block daily** (often more, depending on weather and age group). If weather limits outdoor time, we substitute with indoor movement/gross-motor activities.\n\n**What matters most when deciding among applicants:**\n1) **Schedule fit & reliability** (consistent attendance, workable drop-off/pick-up windows)\n2) **Family–school partnership** (communication, responsiveness, shared expectations around routines)\n3) **Child fit for a play-based, routine-driven environment** (comfort with transitions, group settings, growing independence)\n4) **Practical logistics/proximity** insofar as it supports punctuality and consistency\nWe don’t formally prioritize “parent involvement” as a requirement, but we value families who engage constructively when needed.\n\nIf you tell me your child’s **age**, the **start date** you want, and the **weekly schedule** you need (days/hours, plus any flexibility), I can be candid about how strong the fit looks. And if Nursery_E is a serious contender for you this cycle, I’d encourage submitting an **application sooner rather than later** since we have a single place.\n",
              "thought": "Parent_E is on our true priority list but below Parent_A and Parent_C (who is already matched elsewhere). Remaining unmatched are A, B, E; we have 1 seat. Parent_A ranks us last, so unlikely to apply; Parent_B ranks us 4th, also less likely. Parent_E ranks us last too, but is engaging and could apply if other options reject. Best strategy: keep Parent_E warm, provide strong info, and gently encourage applying soon while collecting schedule/fit details; do not accept unless they apply."
