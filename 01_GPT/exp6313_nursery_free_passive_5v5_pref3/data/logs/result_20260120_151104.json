Your priorities (a warm, well-structured environment and clear family communication) align very well with Nursery_E, and your flexibility on start date/schedule is especially helpful for planning.\n\nWe would be happy to offer you our available spot. To finalize, could you please confirm:\n1) your preferred start window (earliest/latest), and\n2) the schedule you’re aiming for (days/hours), even if flexible.\n\nOnce you reply with those details, we’ll send the next-step paperwork and transition plan information right away.",

We’re a reliable, communicative family and we’re looking for a warm, consistent routine with lots of play/outdoor time and strong social-emotional support. If there’s any additional information you’d like from us to support your decision, I can provide it right away. Also, could you share your expected timeline for confirming your remaining placement?",
              "thought": "Nursery_D is 4th on my true list, but only D and E remain unmatched in round 8, so I likely need to secure a spot now. I have not yet formally applied to Nursery_D, only talked. Given capacities are 1 each, remaining competition may be low, but Nursery_D’s priority ranks me 2nd (after Parent_D), which is favorable if Parent_D is already matched elsewhere. Applying now maximizes chance of getting matched to D rather than risking ending unmatched or settling for E (my 5th)."
