              "message": "Hello Parent_A—thank you for reaching out. I’m glad you’re considering Nursery_E, and I’m happy to share the key details.\n\nProgram & priorities (how we review families):\n- We prioritize strong home–school partnership: clear communication, consistency with routines, and a collaborative approach when a child needs extra support.\n- Schedule fit matters (drop-off/pick-up reliability), but we try to be flexible where we can—especially around initial transition.\n- We value families who align with a play-based, relationship-centered classroom and who support community norms (kindness, respect, health/safety policies).\n\nHours & calendar (typical structure):\n- We operate on a school-year calendar with planned closures/holidays and professional development days.\n- Daily hours include a standard drop-off window in the morning and pick-up in the afternoon; we can discuss exact times and any extended-care options depending on your needs.\n\nStart date flexibility:\n- If a child is ready and a spot is available, we can often accommodate a start within a reasonable window. If you have a specific target start date, tell me and I’ll let you know what’s feasible.\n\nSupporting new children (transition period):\n- We use gradual entry when helpful (shorter initial days, caregiver goodbye routine, consistent handoff).\n- Teachers focus on attachment and predictability: same greeting, visual routines, and a “key teacher” who checks in frequently.\n- We communicate closely during the first 2–3 weeks (what’s going well, what’s hard, and strategies that work at home).\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you accurately:\n1) Your child’s age and any prior group-care experience?\n2) Any schedule constraints (earliest drop-off / latest pick-up) and your ideal start month?\n3) Anything that helps with transitions (comfort item, separation routine, temperament)?\n\nIf Nursery_E is a serious option for you, you’re very welcome to submit an application—an [APPLY] helps us move from general info to next steps quickly and make sure we can meet your timing.",
