We tailor support to each child’s needs.\n- Afternoon: small-group activities (art/sensory/early literacy), outdoor time, and pickup with a brief handover.\n\nOur approach:\n- Warm, consistent caregiving with predictable routines.\n- Play-based learning with gentle structure.\n- Strong emphasis on emotional regulation, kindness, and independence.\n\nExpectations for families:\n- Open communication (especially in the first month), and sharing any changes at home that might affect your child.\n- Consistent drop-off routine (we’ll help you develop one) and punctuality where possible.\n- Partnership on toileting, sleep, and behavior support so home and school feel aligned.\n\nWhat we value most in the first few weeks (transition):\n- A gradual, child-led settling plan when possible (shorter days at first, then building up).\n- A secure attachment with a designated key person—your child should know exactly who to go to for comfort.\n- Consistency: same goodbye routine, clear reassurance, and predictable pick-up.\n- Frequent updates to you (brief daily notes) so you feel confident and your child feels continuity.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age, any nap/toileting patterns, and what helps them feel safe in new settings—then I can suggest a transition plan that fits your family.

I’m happy to answer point by point:\n\n1) Free play vs. guided activities\n- Mornings typically start with 30–45 minutes of free-choice centers (blocks, pretend play, sensory table, art invitations, books). Teachers observe and join play to scaffold language and social skills.\n- We then do a short whole-group circle (10–15 minutes) for songs, story, and a simple shared routine.\n- The rest of the morning alternates between small-group guided activities (literacy/numeracy through games, art, science/sensory) and open-ended play. We generally aim for a play-forward balance—roughly 60/40 play-led to teacher-guided across the day, adjusted for the group’s needs.\n\n2) Transitions, conflict resolution, and emotional support\n- Transitions: we use predictable cues (visual schedule, “first/then” language, timers, transition songs) and we pre-warn children before changes. For children who need extra support, we use individual jobs (line leader, helper), choice within transitions, and calm coaching.\n- Conflict resolution: we coach in the moment—naming feelings, supporting turn-taking, and teaching simple scripts (“I don’t like that,” “Can I have a turn when you’re done?”). We keep it gentle and consistent, and we follow up with repairing (checking on a friend, helping rebuild, etc.).\n- Independence: we break skills into steps, model, then fade support (e.g., coat/shoes, tidying, toileting routines where applicable) while keeping expectations realistic and encouraging.\n\n3) Communication with families\n- Daily: quick handover at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily note (highlights, meals/rest, any notable moments). For younger children or those needing more support, we can add a bit more detail.\n- Ongoing: we message/call proactively if we notice patterns (sleep/transition challenges, peer conflicts, separation anxiety) so we can align strategies.\n- Formal: scheduled conferences during the year, and we’re always open to additional meetings if something comes up.\n\nVisits/observations\nYes—there are a few observation slots coming up. If you share your availability (weekday mornings vs. afternoons, and 2–3 preferred dates), we’ll offer the nearest openings.\n\nA couple quick questions so we can confirm fit and suggest the best visit time: your child’s age, any separation/transition patterns we should know about, and the start date/hours you’re hoping for.

For children who find transitions hard, we use individualized supports (a “helper job,” a comfort object where appropriate, or a staff check-in before moving).\n- Conflict resolution: we coach in-the-moment using simple steps—naming feelings, setting boundaries (“I won’t let you hit”), helping children use words/signals, and guiding turn-taking/problem-solving. The goal is calm, respectful co-regulation, not punitive responses.\n\n(3) Communication with families\n- Daily: brief pickup handover plus a short daily update (what they engaged with, mood, meals/rest highlights).\n- Ongoing: we’re responsive by message/email for quick check-ins.\n- Deeper touchpoints: scheduled conferences/check-ins during the year, and we’re proactive if we notice a pattern (sleep, separation, peer dynamics, etc.).\n\nAdmissions timeline / what helps you be a strong fit\n- Yes, we are considering applications now, and because we have a single place, we do tend to decide as soon as we have a strong match.\n- What we look for is mainly alignment and partnership: families who value routine, communicate openly, and are comfortable collaborating on transitions/behavior support.\n\nVisits/observations\n- We can absolutely arrange a short visit/observation. If you share two or three windows of availability (e.g., weekday mornings), your child’s age, and your ideal start date, I’ll propose specific times.\n\nIf Nursery_E is a top contender for you, I’d encourage you to apply soon so we can formally consider you while the place is still open.

We can fully commit to your schedule and policies (reliable drop-off/pick-up, consistent attendance, and responsive communication), and we’re ready to complete any paperwork or provide references immediately. If there’s anything you need from us to finalize consideration, please let me know and I’ll send it right away.",

At round 6, Nursery_E is the only remaining unmatched nursery, so securing it now avoids ending unmatched. I have only talked with Nursery_E before and have not applied yet, so I should apply. Nursery_E’s priority ranks me 4th, but other higher-priority parents are presumably already matched since only Nursery_E remains, so an application now should be accepted if they still have capacity."

We’re happy to move forward and offer you our open spot.\n\nNext steps to finalize:\n1) Please send your child’s full name and date of birth, your preferred start date, and your needed days/hours.\n2) I’ll reply with our enrollment packet (registration form, emergency contacts, medical/allergy info, and policies) and a date to return it.\n3) If you have references, you’re welcome to include them, but they’re not required to confirm the place.\n\nOnce we have the completed packet, we’ll confirm your start date and schedule a short settling-in/visit if you’d like.",

No higher-priority parents (A/C/B) are available now, so accept to secure a match within quota 1."
