While Parent_C is top priority, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and is likely to apply to Nursery_D or Nursery_A first; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last; Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 1st but is 4th on our list. Given Parent_D's strong commitment and high mutual interest (Nursery_C is their 1st choice), accepting now is a good outcome and reduces risk of ending unmatched or with a lower-priority parent later."

Since Parent_B ranks Nursery_B 1st and is applying now, rejecting risks ending unmatched if D/A never come.
