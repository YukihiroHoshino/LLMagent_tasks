Many 3s nap; for older 4–5s who don’t sleep, we offer a calm quiet-time routine (books, quiet table activities) while protecting the room’s rest environment.\n- **2:00–2:30** Wake-up + snack\n- **2:30–3:30** Project time / small groups (storytelling, science/art, phonological awareness through games)\n- **3:30–4:15** **Second outdoor block** when possible (often 30–45 minutes)\n- **4:15–5:30** Late pickup window + calm free play/reading\n\n**2) Supporting transitions in the first few weeks**\nWe use a gradual, child-centered settling plan:\n- **Pre-start family meeting** (quick call or in-person) to learn routines, comfort strategies, separation history, and any sensitivities.\n- **Staggered start/short initial days** when possible (especially helpful for first-time group care).\n- **Consistent “goodbye routine”** (we coach families to keep it brief and predictable; teachers take over with a warm handoff).\n- **Primary teacher point-person** for the first 2–3 weeks so your child has a reliable “safe base.”\n- **Intentional peer connections** (we pair new children with a friendly buddy, invite them into play, and scaffold turn-taking).\n- **Extra communication early on** (we typically send more frequent updates in week 1 so you’re not wondering how it’s going).\n\n**3) Parent involvement + communication (frequency/tools)**\n- **Daily touchpoints** at drop-off/pickup (quick highlights + anything to know for the evening/morning).\n- **Messaging tool/app** for short updates and logistics (and to share occasional photos/notes—frequency varies by the day, but you can expect regular check-ins, especially early on).\n- **Scheduled conferences** (and we’re available sooner whenever something comes up).\n- **What we ask from parents:** responsiveness to messages, sharing routine changes (sleep, big life events), and partnering with us on consistent strategies. Volunteering is welcome but **not required**.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: is your child currently napping most days, and how have separations gone in other settings? If Nursery_E is feeling like a strong fit, I’d encourage you to **apply to Nursery_E** soon—our single opening can move quickly once families start submitting applications.",
