If you share your ideal drop-off/pick-up window, I can confirm what we can support.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately:\n1) Your child’s age and any particular needs (allergies, nap routine, language support)?\n2) What hours are you aiming for, and when would you want to start?\n\nIf things sound aligned, you’re welcome to apply at any time—Parent_D families are a great fit for us and we’d be glad to consider your application promptly.",

Nursery_C’s priority ranks me 1st, so an application here is very likely to be accepted immediately. However, accepting now would forgo any chance at D/A/B, which I prefer. Since it’s only round 1 and no one is matched yet, I should not lock in a lower choice yet; instead I should keep Nursery_C warm as a strong backup and gather info about timing/holding policies.
