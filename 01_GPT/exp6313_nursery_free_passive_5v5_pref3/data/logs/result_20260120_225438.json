We also use short small-group moments for routines, phonological awareness, and fine-motor practice.\n\nCommunication: we do brief daily updates at pick-up, plus regular photo/learning notes and a monthly summary of themes and developmental goals. We’re also easy to reach for quick check-ins.\n\nOn demand: we do expect solid interest this cycle, but it can vary by family fit and timing—if Nursery_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to share what you’re looking for (schedule needs, temperament, any priorities) so we can confirm fit and next steps.\n\nWhat matters most to you—outdoor time, academics/structure, or a particular communication style?",
