When considering applicants, we especially look for:\n- **Alignment with our approach** (kind, firm boundaries; coaching children through emotions)\n- **Commitment to respectful communication** between home and school\n- **Readiness for group care routines** (with support—no child is expected to be “perfect,” just supported)\n- **A collaborative mindset** if a child needs extra help with transitions, separation, or peer conflicts\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to learn a bit more about your child (age, temperament, any transitions coming up) and what “good communication” looks like for your family (daily notes vs. pickup chats vs. a weekly summary).

In conflicts we:\n- Stay close, calm, and **coach in the moment** (we don’t expect kids to “figure it out” alone)\n- Help children **label emotions**, then **state the problem**\n- Support **safe boundaries** (e.g., stopping hitting/biting immediately) and guide toward alternatives\n- Facilitate **repair** (checking on a friend, practicing words, making amends)\n- Look for patterns and partner with families if a behavior repeats (consistent strategies across home/school)\n\n3) **Communication with parents**\nWe aim for no surprises and a strong partnership:\n- **Brief daily touchpoints** at drop-off/pickup when helpful\n- **Regular updates** on how the day went (highlights, meals/rest, notable social moments)\n- **Scheduled conferences** and goal check-ins, plus additional meetings any time something needs attention\n- If an incident occurs (injury, repeated conflict, big emotions), we communicate **promptly and directly** with context and next steps.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to understand your needs so I can tell you quickly whether we’re a strong fit: your child’s **age**, your **ideal start date**, and the **schedule** you need (days/hours).
