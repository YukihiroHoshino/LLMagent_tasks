We balance structure with plenty of child-led exploration.\n\nSocial-emotional support: our educators use positive guidance and coaching (naming feelings, helping children practice turn-taking and problem-solving). We also use small-group activities to build empathy and communication, and we partner closely with families so strategies are consistent across home and school.\n\nStart date & hours: our next intake starts at the beginning of the upcoming term, and our standard hours are 8:30–15:30 (with an early drop-off/late pick-up option depending on availability).\n\nIf Nursery_A feels like a strong fit, you’re very welcome to apply this round or next—I'd be happy to move quickly given your interest.",

We emphasize predictable structure with flexibility for individual needs.\n\n**Communication with parents**: We aim for proactive, clear updates—regular check-ins, quick messages for day-to-day items, and scheduled touchpoints for developmental progress. If something needs attention, we reach out early and collaborate on a plan.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child’s age, temperament, and what you’re hoping to see in a nursery day—then I can speak more specifically about fit and next steps.",
