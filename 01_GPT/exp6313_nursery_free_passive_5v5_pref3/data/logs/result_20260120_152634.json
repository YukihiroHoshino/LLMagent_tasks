We focus on social-emotional development, language growth, independence/self-help skills, and curiosity through projects and rotating activity stations. We use positive guidance and lots of communication with families.\n\nFlexibility on hours: We offer standard core hours with options for early drop-off/late pick-up depending on availability. If you share your needed schedule, I can tell you what’s feasible.\n\nWhat we prioritize in applicants: We look for a strong family-school partnership and readiness to engage with our routines—consistent attendance, open communication, and alignment with a play-based, child-centered approach. We also consider the child’s needs and how we can best support them within the group.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you tell me your child’s age, any specific needs/interests, and the hours you’re hoping for?
