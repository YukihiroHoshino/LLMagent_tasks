Once it’s filled, we can only offer a waitlist.\n- To apply: a short parent meeting (virtual/in-person) + a brief application form.\n- If accepted: enrollment packet (emergency contacts/authorized pickups), immunization/health documentation as required locally, and any allergy/action plans.\nIf you’re considering applying, I’d recommend doing so soon so we can make a timely decision while the spot is still available.\n\n(3) Typical day (high level)\n- Arrival & settling-in\n- Morning play-based learning blocks (language/storytime, early numeracy through games, sensory/art, music & movement)\n- Outdoor time daily when weather allows\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon small-group activity + free play\n- Pickup\n\nWhat makes an application stronger for Nursery_E\n- Clear, confirmed schedule needs (days/times) and a realistic start date.\n- Sharing your child’s routines/temperament and any supports (allergies, sleep needs, separation transitions) so we can plan well.\n- Responsiveness and readiness to complete required records quickly if offered the spot.\n\nTo help us assess fit quickly: what start date are you aiming for, and what exact weekly schedule (days + drop-off/pick-up times) do you need?",
