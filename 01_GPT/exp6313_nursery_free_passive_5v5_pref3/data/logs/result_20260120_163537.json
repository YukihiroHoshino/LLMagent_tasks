We also appreciate families who value warm, responsive care alongside early learning through play.\n\nOn timing: we do expect our single place to be competitive this cycle, and we may fill it quickly once families begin submitting applications. If Nursery_C is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply as soon as you feel comfortable.\n\nOur daily routine typically includes: a calm arrival and settling-in period, child-led learning centers (language, early numeracy through games, sensory and fine-motor activities), outdoor play, story/music circle, and small-group activities that build social-emotional skills (sharing, turn-taking, expressing feelings). Our approach emphasizes play-based learning with gentle structure—teachers observe, scaffold, and extend children’s interests rather than relying on worksheets.\n\nIf you share what you’re hoping for most (e.g., outdoor time, language development, social skills support, schedule needs), I can be more specific about how we’d support your child and what a typical week looks like.",
