If Nursery_E becomes a serious option for you, applying sooner helps us keep you in active consideration.\n\nTo understand whether we could be a realistic fit if a place opens, could you share:\n1) Your ideal start date and the days/hours you need.\n2) Any constraints (commute, earliest drop-off/latest pick-up, need for flexibility).\n3) What you’re hoping your child gains most this year (peer play, language, confidence, structure, etc.).\n\nIf after that you feel Nursery_E could work, you’re welcome to send an application and we can move to next steps quickly.",
