We use consistent visual cues and routines so children know what to expect and feel secure.\n\n**Supporting social-emotional development:** We focus on naming emotions, co-regulation, and practicing peer skills in real moments (turn-taking, repairing after conflict, asking to join play). Staff model calm language, help children label feelings (“I see you’re frustrated”), and guide them toward solutions (“What can we try next?”). We also use positive reinforcement for prosocial behavior and communicate patterns we notice so home and school can align.\n\n**What we value in families (selection fit):** Strong day-to-day partnership—open communication, consistency with routines, responsiveness to guidance, and a collaborative mindset if challenges arise. We also appreciate families who value community and kindness, and who share information that helps us support their child well.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a bit about your child’s temperament and what you’re hoping for this year (e.g., structure vs. flexibility, social goals, any sensitivities).
