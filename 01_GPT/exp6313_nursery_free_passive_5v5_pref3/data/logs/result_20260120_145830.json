Here are clear answers to your three questions:\n\n1) Core admissions/placement priorities + waitlist\n- We place families primarily by our priority order (our internal priority list) once a family submits an application.\n- After that, we confirm practical fit: start window, schedule/after-care needs, and our ability to support the child’s routine.\n- If our single opening is taken, we do maintain a waitlist (ordered by the same priority rules + timing of application), and we contact families immediately if a space opens.\n\n2) Decision timeline / deadlines\n- We can move quickly once you apply. If we can offer you the space, we typically ask families to confirm within a short window (usually 48–72 hours) so we can be fair to other families who are waiting.\n- There’s no fixed “deadline” this round, but because we have limited capacity, earlier applications are strongly advantaged.\n\n3) After-care + typical daily schedule\n- Typical day (high level):\n  • Arrival & settling-in / choice play\n  • Morning circle (songs/stories, social-emotional check-in)\n  • Play-based learning centers + small groups (language, early math through play, art/sensory, practical life)\n  • Outdoor time daily (weather permitting), usually a substantial late-morning block and often a shorter afternoon block\n  • Lunch + hygiene routine\n  • Rest/quiet time\n  • Afternoon project/play + movement/outdoor\n  • Pick-up with brief handover\n- After-care: we can often accommodate extended-day needs depending on enrollment/staffing for the year. If you share your earliest drop-off and latest pick-up needs (and how many days/week), I can tell you what we can realistically support.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you accurately and (if you decide) help you move forward smoothly:\n1) Where is Nursery_E currently on your preference list relative to your other options?\n2) What hours do you need (earliest drop-off / latest pick-up), and do you anticipate after-care regularly?\n\nIf Nursery_E is becoming a top choice for you, I’d encourage you to submit an application as soon as you’re ready so we can consider you while we still have availability.",

However, signaling strong interest and fit may help if they consider ties/soft factors, and keeping optionality is valuable while I still might pursue Nursery_C later.

When multiple families are a good fit, we also consider continuity factors where applicable.\n\n3) **What’s most helpful for you to provide:** If you’d like to be seriously considered, the most helpful next step is an **application** plus a short note covering:\n- Child’s **age** and any relevant transition/support needs\n- Your **ideal schedule** (days/hours) and **earliest/latest feasible start date**\n- Any flexibility (e.g., could you start part-time then move to full-time, or vice versa)\n- What you want your child to gain this year (routine, peer skills, language, independence)\n\nGiven what you shared—wanting a consistent routine and warm, play-based environment, with some flexibility—**you do sound like a potentially good fit**, and an application would be competitive *if* your schedule lines up with what we can accommodate.\n\nIf you send your child’s age + the specific hours/days you’re hoping for, I can tell you quickly whether that looks workable before you invest too much time in paperwork.",

Given Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me last, I’m unlikely to win if any other parent is still available, but at this late stage others may already be matched. Best move is a final concise talk that (a) confirms immediate acceptance and (b) asks for the single missing step / whether any higher-priority family is pending, without spamming further."

Parent_A is repeatedly signaling readiness but has not provided the requested schedule/start-date/age details and has not sent [APPLY] this round. Since their current tag is [TALK], we must respond with [TALK], clearly stating availability and that we can decide today, and specifying the single final item needed: one [APPLY] message with schedule alternatives, start date, and age. We should also nudge them to send it immediately so we can accept in the final round if it fits staffing."
