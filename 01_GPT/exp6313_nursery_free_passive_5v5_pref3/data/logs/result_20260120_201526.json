We focus strongly on communication, independence (self-care routines), and positive peer interaction.\n\n**Hours & flexibility:**\nWe can accommodate **standard and extended-day needs** depending on the schedule you’re looking for. If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up window (and any days that differ), I can confirm what we can offer.\n\n**Biggest strengths for families:**\n1) **Warm, consistent caregivers** and steady routines (helps children feel secure quickly).\n2) **Balanced structure + child-led play**—good preparation for the next stage without being overly academic.\n3) **Clear communication with parents** (regular updates on the day and developmental milestones).\n\nTo help me advise you best: what are your top 2–3 priorities (hours, location, outdoor time, learning style, meals, etc.) and your child’s age/temperament?

Typically we start with shorter visits (sometimes with a caregiver nearby at first), then increase independence and duration as the child shows readiness. We keep drop-off routines predictable and brief (warm goodbye, clear “I’ll be back after…” framing), assign a consistent key adult for the child to build trust quickly, and use comfort strategies (transitional object, a family photo, calm corner, sensory tools). We also proactively coordinate with you on what works at home and we’ll adjust the pace if a child needs more time.\n\n2) Daily communication: We prioritize reliable, practical updates. Families receive a short daily summary (mood, meals, naps/rest, toileting if relevant, key activities/learning moments) and we flag anything notable the same day. We also do quick verbal handovers at pickup when possible, and we schedule check-ins during the settling-in period so you’re not left guessing.\n\n3) What we value most when selecting families: A collaborative partnership—clear, respectful communication; consistency with routines/expectations; and a shared commitment to supporting children’s independence and kindness. We also value families who engage constructively if challenges arise (sleep, biting, separation anxiety, etc.) so we can respond as a team.\n\nFrom what you’ve shared so far, this sounds very aligned.

Lunch is followed by a rest/quiet period (with flexible options for children who don’t sleep), then afternoon project/play time and a closing circle before pickup. Throughout the day we emphasize social-emotional learning, independence (toileting/handwashing/putting away materials), and lots of movement and outdoor play.\n\n2) Settling-in support: We use a gradual transition plan tailored to the child—typically a short first visit with a caregiver, then increasing time over several days. We assign a consistent key educator for check-ins, keep routines predictable, and communicate daily (what helped, what was hard, what we’ll try next). We also collaborate with families on comfort objects, separation strategies, and any specific needs.\n\n3) What we value in selecting/working with families: We prioritize families who align with our routines and can partner closely—clear communication, consistency with drop-off/pick-up, and a shared approach to supporting independence and gentle boundaries.
