Teachers observe closely and gently extend play with questions, new vocabulary, and simple challenges—so it’s child-led with intentional support.\n\n2) Typical day (high level): Arrival and warm welcome → open play/centers → short morning circle (songs, story, routines) → snack → outdoor play/gross motor → small-group activity (art/sensory/pre-literacy/pre-math depending on age) → lunch → rest/quiet time → afternoon centers and/or outdoor play → pickup and brief family handoff.\n\n3) What we value in family–school partnership: Consistent communication, reliability with schedules (especially arrival/pickup), and alignment on routines/expectations so children experience a predictable, respectful environment. We also appreciate families sharing what helps their child thrive (comfort strategies, interests, any sensitivities) so we can support smoothly.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you tell me (a) your preferred start date, (b) the schedule you need, and (c) any priorities or considerations for your child (e.g., temperament, allergies, nap needs)?
