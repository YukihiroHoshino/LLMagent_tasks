Afternoons typically include small-group activities (storytelling, phonological games, puzzles, building) and more free play before pick-up.\n\nSocial & early learning support: We use small-group play and guided peer interactions to build turn-taking, empathy, and conflict resolution (naming feelings, coaching “how to ask,” and repairing).

However, we have no current application from Parent_A this round, while Parent_E is applying now and is ready to commit immediately. To avoid risking ending unmatched by waiting, accept Parent_E now to fill our only seat with an acceptable, committed family."
