We can accommodate common dietary needs/allergies with advance notice and clear documentation.\n- Rest: We offer a structured quiet period. Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet activities (books, puzzles) after an initial rest attempt, so they’re not forced to sleep.\n- Individual needs: Within reason, we adapt transitions, seating, and calming strategies; if there are specific routines (sleep associations, sensory needs, toileting plans), we’ll align with you and create a consistent approach.\n\n3) Communication with parents\n- Daily: brief pick-up check-in plus a short written update (highlights, mood, meals/rest notes). Depending on the class, this is via our messaging/app system.\n- Weekly: a summary of themes/skills, photos, and what’s coming next.\n- Conferences: scheduled progress conferences (and additional meetings as needed).\n\nTo make sure we’re addressing fit: what age group are you seeking and what hours do you need?
