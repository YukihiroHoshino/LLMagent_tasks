Nursery_E ranks me 4th as well (ahead of Parent_D only), so also uncertain, but since this is the only nursery I can engage with this round, I should keep the option open without committing yet.

If you apply, we can review immediately and aim to give you a clear answer on a short timeline (e.g., within 24–48 hours), depending on any final conversations already in motion.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can guide next steps:\n1) When are you hoping to start (immediate vs. later)?\n2) Do you need full-time or part-time?\n3) Where does Nursery_E sit relative to your other options right now (top choice vs. one of several)?",
