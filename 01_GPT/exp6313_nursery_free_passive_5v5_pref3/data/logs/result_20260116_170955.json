We balance structured learning with plenty of child-led play.\n\nSocial-emotional approach: We focus on helping children name feelings, practice turn-taking and problem-solving, and build independence. Teachers use consistent routines, gentle coaching during conflicts, and lots of positive reinforcement. We also communicate regularly with families so strategies are consistent between home and school.\n\nDrop-off/pick-up flexibility: We can typically accommodate a reasonable window for drop-off and pick-up, and we’ll work with families on occasional schedule constraints when communicated in advance.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age and what matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, language exposure, naps, transition support).

We keep structured segments developmentally appropriate and brief, and we follow children’s interests for much of the day.\n\nSocial-emotional development: This is a core focus.

Teachers model and narrate social interactions, and we partner closely with families so strategies are consistent between home and school.\n\nTransition (first few weeks): We plan a gradual transition whenever possible—shorter initial days, a consistent key teacher, and predictable drop-off routines. We’ll work with you on a goodbye plan (quick, consistent, and reassuring), and we provide regular check-ins during the first weeks so you know how your child is settling. We also use comfort items if helpful and build connection through one-on-one moments early on.\n\nHours & flexibility: Our typical day supports working families with standard drop-off/pick-up windows (and we can discuss earlier/later options depending on your needed schedule and availability).

A common flow is: arrival & free play → morning circle (songs, calendar/weather, community norms) → small-group activities (early literacy, early math, fine-motor/arts, hands-on projects) → outdoor time/gross motor → lunch → rest/quiet period → afternoon centers (sensory, blocks, pretend play, art) → story/music → pick-up. We aim for daily outdoor time and plenty of free-play/center time, with short structured blocks that are developmentally appropriate.\n\nSocial-emotional development & routines: We explicitly teach feelings vocabulary, turn-taking, and problem-solving. Teachers coach conflicts calmly (“name it, pause, try a strategy”), reinforce positive choices, and use consistent classroom routines/visual cues so children know what to expect. We focus on independence (self-help skills, tidying up, transitions) and building a kind classroom community.\n\nSupporting new children (first weeks): We use a gradual transition plan where possible—shorter initial days or a stepped approach if needed. We assign a primary teacher point-person, keep routines extra consistent, and use comfort objects/visual schedules. We also communicate closely with families during the first 2–3 weeks (quick check-ins at drop-off/pick-up and regular updates) to align on strategies that help your child feel secure.\n\nDrop-off/pick-up & flexibility: We typically offer a reasonable morning drop-off window and an afternoon pick-up window, and we can usually accommodate occasional constraints with advance notice. If you share your approximate schedule needs, I can tell you what we can reliably support.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you best: How old is your child, and what kind of temperament do they have in new settings (slow-to-warm vs. jump-right-in)?

We’re very happy to move forward with you.\n\nWe can confirm a place for your child at Nursery_E. Your emphasis on a supportive settling-in period and strong family communication aligns closely with how we work, and we’re confident this will be a great fit.\n\nNext steps: please send your child’s age/date of birth, your ideal drop-off/pick-up schedule, and any notes on temperament/separation (plus any comfort items/routines that help). We’ll then schedule a short onboarding call to agree on a settling-in plan and start date.\n\nWe’re looking forward to welcoming your family.",

Given Nursery_B’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_B), I may be disadvantaged if any of those parents are still in play, but they may already be matched elsewhere.
