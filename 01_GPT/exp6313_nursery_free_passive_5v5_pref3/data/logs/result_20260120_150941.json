We’d be happy to share more.\n\nWhat we prioritize most for incoming children/families:\n1) Settling-in (transition): We use a gradual, child-led settling-in plan (typically over several short visits, then increasing time). We aim for consistency of key staff so your child builds a secure relationship quickly, and we keep daily communication very clear during the first weeks.\n2) Approach to learning: Play-based learning with a strong focus on social-emotional development, language, and independence (routines, self-care skills). We observe children closely and adapt activities to their interests and pace.\n3) Partnership with families: Regular check-ins, quick daily handovers, and scheduled progress chats. We value aligned expectations between home and nursery.\n4) Practical flexibility: We try to be as accommodating as possible with schedules within our staffing ratios and routines—if you have specific days/hours in mind, tell me and I’ll confirm what we can offer.\n\nA couple quick questions to guide what to share next: what start date are you considering, and what schedule (days/hours) would you ideally need? Also, is there anything particularly important for your child (e.g., separation anxiety, language needs, allergies)?",

We focus on social-emotional development (sharing, routines, independence) alongside early literacy and numeracy in age-appropriate ways.\n\n**Typical daily routine:**\n- Arrival & settling-in / free play\n- Morning circle (songs, stories, calendar/weather)\n- Learning centers / small-group activities\n- Outdoor play\n- Lunch\n- Rest/quiet time\n- Afternoon activities (art/music/movement) + outdoor time\n- Pick-up\n\n**Hours:** We offer standard weekday care with morning drop-off and afternoon pick-up windows; if you tell me what schedule you need, I can confirm the closest fit.\n\n**Key policies:** We emphasize consistent routines, positive guidance (no harsh discipline), clear illness guidance (stay home when contagious), and regular parent communication. We also support gradual transitions for new children.\n\nIf you share your child’s age, any allergies/support needs, and what matters most to your family (e.g., academics, outdoor time, flexibility), I can be more specific about fit.
