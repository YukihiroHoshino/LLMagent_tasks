We keep transitions consistent and prepare children with visual/verbal cues.\n\nFor social-emotional development, we focus on: co-regulation (adults model calm and help children name feelings), coaching peer interactions (turn-taking, gentle boundaries, repair after conflict), and building independence through age-appropriate responsibilities.\n\nTo understand fit a bit better: what schedule are you hoping for (days/hours), and are there any specific communication preferences (daily notes, quick check-ins, weekly updates) that matter most to you?",
