We also emphasize gentle conflict resolution, independence (self-care routines), and close family communication.\n\nOn timeline: we review applications on a rolling basis and can make offers quickly once we’ve received an application and confirmed fit/availability. With limited spots, we encourage families who are seriously considering us to apply sooner rather than later.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what schedule you’re seeking (full/part-time, start date) and what matters most for your child (e.g., outdoor-heavy, language focus, quieter environment).

Given full information: Nursery_B’s priority ranks me 4th (behind Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_B). Parent_B has Nursery_B as their top choice and is ranked above me at Nursery_B, so if Parent_B applies there, I likely lose. Nursery_D is my top choice and ranks me 3rd; Nursery_A ranks me last. Since I’m currently paired with Nursery_B, it’s better to keep the option open and gather info rather than apply now, to avoid locking into a lower outcome if I can still pursue Nursery_D. I should lightly signal interest and ask about timing/availability to decide whether to apply in a later round if D/A don’t work out."
