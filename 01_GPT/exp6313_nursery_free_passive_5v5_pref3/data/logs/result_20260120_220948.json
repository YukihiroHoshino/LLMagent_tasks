We balance child-led play with small-group guided activities.\n\n**Typical day (example):**\n- Arrival & free play / settling-in\n- Morning circle (songs, calendar/weather, theme intro)\n- Learning centers / small-group activities\n- Outdoor play / gross-motor time\n- Lunch\n- Quiet/rest time\n- Afternoon project (art, sensory, science, music)\n- Snack\n- Outdoor/free play & pick-up\n\n**Communication with parents:** We aim for frequent, practical updates—daily notes on meals/rest/mood, periodic photos or activity highlights, and scheduled check-ins. We also welcome quick conversations at drop-off/pick-up and can arrange longer meetings as needed.\n\n**Enrollment priorities:** We look for overall fit and readiness to thrive in our routine—e.g., alignment with our play-based approach, consistency in attendance, and ability to work collaboratively with families. Practical factors like schedule needs and start timing can matter as well.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me your child’s age, start date, and any specific needs (e.g., nap schedule, allergies, language support). I can also share what a typical week’s themes look like.\n\n[TALK]",
