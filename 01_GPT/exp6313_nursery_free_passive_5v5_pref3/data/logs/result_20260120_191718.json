In week 1, we typically start with shorter days (or a shorter morning block) and build up as your child shows comfort.\n- We assign a consistent key educator to help your child form a secure relationship quickly.\n- We keep routines predictable (same arrival rhythm, visual cues, consistent goodbye routine) and coordinate closely with you on what helps (comfort item, preferred soothing strategies).\n- We’ll share brief daily notes during the transition period so you know how eating, mood, play engagement, and separation are going.\n\n(2) Naps + outdoor time (timing & flexibility):\n- Outdoor time: daily, usually late morning and/or mid-afternoon depending on weather and the group’s energy. We’re flexible—if a group is especially regulated by outdoor play, we prioritize it.\n- Nap/rest: after lunch. Younger children who need longer sleep are accommodated; older children who don’t nap have a quiet rest period and then calm activities (books, puzzles, table work) so the room stays restful.\n- We adjust expectations by age and individual needs (e.g., easing into the full rest routine during the first weeks).\n\nTo make sure we’re a strong match: how old is your child, and are naps currently consistent at home (duration/timing)?

Given capacities are 1 each and competition is tight, I should keep Nursery_C as a viable fallback. Importantly, Nursery_C ranks me (Parent_C) as its top priority, so an application here is likely to be accepted if still available. To maximize chance of matching as high as possible, I can apply now to secure a strong option rather than risk ending unmatched if B rejects and other nurseries fill. Applying to C does forgo potential later match with D/A/B only if those were still open, but I have no current channel with D/A and B may reject; since C strongly prefers me, locking it in is strategically safe."
