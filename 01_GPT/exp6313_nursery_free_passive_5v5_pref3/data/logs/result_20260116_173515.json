Staff model language for emotions and help children practice self-regulation through predictable transitions, calm corners, and positive reinforcement.\n\nOn drop-off/pick-up flexibility: we have set core hours for staffing ratios and classroom rhythm, but we can sometimes accommodate a small window on either end depending on your needs and the overall schedule mix in the class.

If you have any relevant references or notes you’d like us to have on file, you’re welcome to send those as well.\n\nWe’re excited about the possibility of welcoming your family to Nursery_D.",
