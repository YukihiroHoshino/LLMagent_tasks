If you share your expected schedule needs and any community/sibling connection, I can better gauge fit.\n\nOn the “one spot” question: it’s early and we’re still speaking with multiple families, so I can’t promise availability yet. If Nursery_C is a serious option for you, it helps to know how highly you’d rank us and whether you’d be ready to apply if a place becomes available.\n\nCould you tell me your preferred start date, weekly schedule needs, and any factors (location, siblings, etc.) that make Nursery_C a particularly strong match for your family?",

Practically, that means **within a few days of receiving an application + a brief fit check** (and a quick visit if you’d like one). Because we only have **one** remaining space, we do move as soon as we’re confident about fit.\n\n**(2) Commitment / confirmation window:** If we extend an offer, we typically ask for a **firm confirmation within 48 hours**. If you need a bit of flexibility to coordinate logistics, we can sometimes do a **short hold up to ~72 hours**, but we generally can’t keep the spot open longer than that given demand.\n\nIf it’s helpful, yes—please share your **schedule needs (days/hours), desired start date, and what you’re looking for in the classroom**. If it looks aligned, I’d encourage you to **apply right away** so we can move you to the front of the decision process for this last spot.",
