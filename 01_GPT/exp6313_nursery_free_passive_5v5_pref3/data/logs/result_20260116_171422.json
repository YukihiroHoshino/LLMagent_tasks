We find this is kinder than prolonged goodbyes.\n- **Key-person approach:** one primary educator intentionally builds trust early—greeting your child, helping them join play, and being the “safe base” during transitions.\n- **Comfort + regulation supports:** we use familiar objects (comfort item if helpful), visual schedules, and simple co-regulation strategies (quiet corner, breathing/grounding, sensory activities).\n- **Communication during the first days:** for children who are having a hard start, we proactively message/call to confirm they’ve settled and share what helped.\n\n2) **How we communicate with families (day + development):**\n- **Daily touchpoint at drop-off/pick-up:** quick, practical updates (mood, meals, sleep, highlights).\n- **Regular written updates:** we share brief notes on key moments/learning and any concerns that arise (frequency can increase during transitions).\n- **Scheduled check-ins:** we offer conferences/check-ins during the year (and sooner if a child is adjusting, or if you’d like to set goals together).\n- **If something notable happens:** you’ll hear from us the same day—whether it’s an injury, a tough emotional moment, or a big positive milestone.\n\nIf you’re open to it, two quick questions so I can advise you more specifically:\n- What’s your **ideal start date** and **days/hours** needed?\n- Is your child typically **slow-to-warm** or more **ready-to-jump-in** (and have they had any prior caregiver/peer experience)?\n\nIf Nursery_C is moving up your list, you’re also welcome to **apply**—we can then discuss timing and next steps in a more concrete way.\n\n[TALK]",

Check Nursery_C priority: C ranks Parent_C > Parent_B > Parent_D > Parent_E > Parent_A, so I’m 3rd. Parent_A and Parent_E both rank Nursery_C as #1 too, but Nursery_C ranks them below me, so my main competition at C is Parent_C and Parent_B. Parent_C’s top is Nursery_D (likely already matched), so Parent_C may now target Nursery_C or Nursery_A; Parent_B’s top is Nursery_B, so they may not apply to C first. Given C is my #1 and I have decent priority, I should apply immediately to secure the seat before higher-priority applicants do."

Also, when you consider families, what factors matter most for you (e.g., schedule needs, sibling priority, alignment with your approach)? Thank you—happy to share more about our family as well.

              "message": "Hello Parent_E—thank you for the thoughtful questions. Happy to clarify.\n\nCore hours & daily rhythm (typical):\n- Core day: 8:30–15:30 (drop-off window 8:30–9:15; pick-up 15:00–15:30). We can sometimes discuss limited extensions depending on staffing.\n- Outdoor time: usually 2 blocks/day (morning and afternoon), weather permitting.\n- Meals: families provide lunch; we provide a light snack (or you may send one depending on dietary needs). Water available throughout.\n- Nap/quiet time: after lunch (roughly 12:30–14:00). Children who don’t sleep have a quiet rest with books/quiet activities.\n\nKey policies:\n- Late pick-up: we ask families to arrive within the pick-up window. Repeated late pick-ups trigger a check-in meeting and may incur a late fee (primarily to cover staffing). We focus on clear communication—if an emergency happens, we expect a call/text as soon as possible.\n- Illness: children should stay home with fever, vomiting/diarrhea, suspected contagious illness, or when they’re too unwell to participate. Return when symptom-free per public-health guidance (and after the appropriate exclusion period where applicable). We’re careful about outbreaks and will notify families when there are relevant exposures.\n\nWhat we prioritize when choosing among families:\n- Strong fit with our play-based, routine-driven approach and positive guidance philosophy\n- Practical schedule fit (start date + days/hours needed)\n- Clear, reliable communication and partnership with educators\n- Consistency with safety/health and pick-up/drop-off procedures\n(Sibling priority can matter when applicable, but fit and schedule feasibility are the biggest drivers.)\n\nIf you’re open to sharing, I can give you the most accurate sense of fit:\n1) Your child’s age and any nap needs\n2) Ideal start date\n3) Days/hours you need (and whether you need extended care)\n4) Any non-negotiables (language support, outdoor emphasis, allergies, etc.)\n\nIf Nursery_E is still a realistic option for you this cycle, you’re also welcome to submit a formal application—given our limited capacity, we review complete applications promptly.",

In the remaining market, Parent_B is still unmatched but ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last, so they may not apply unless other options reject them. Best move is to keep Parent_E engaged, answer clearly, and ask for key fit details while encouraging an application if they see us as a viable option—without committing yet."
