We balance child-led play with gentle guidance and purposeful activities.\n\nApproach to play/learning: play-based and developmentally focused—social-emotional skills, communication, curiosity, and independence. We use observation to tailor support, and we keep parents in the loop with quick check-ins and periodic updates.\n\nDrop-off/pick-up flexibility: we can usually accommodate a reasonable arrival window in the morning and a short grace period at pick-up; if you anticipate regular early/late needs, tell me what times you’re considering and we’ll confirm what’s feasible.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise accurately: what age is your child, and what schedule (full-time/part-time; typical drop-off/pick-up times) are you hoping for?
