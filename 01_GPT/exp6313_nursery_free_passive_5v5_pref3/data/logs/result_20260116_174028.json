We use play as the core way children build early literacy/numeracy, social skills, and independence—staff set up “invitations to play,” observe, and extend learning with gentle guidance rather than formal worksheets.\n\nFor flexibility: we can usually accommodate a reasonable arrival window in the morning and a pick-up window in the afternoon (and we can discuss particular constraints you have). If you tell me your ideal drop-off/pick-up times and your child’s age/any needs (naps, allergies, language support), I can be specific about what we can offer.\n\nIf Nursery_C is on your shortlist, I’d encourage you to consider applying when you’re ready—our single spot can move quickly once families start submitting applications.

We keep arrivals predictable (same routine, same goodbye script), assign a consistent “primary” teacher for the first weeks, and use comfort objects/photos when helpful.\n- **Separation anxiety supports:** We validate feelings, offer a clear plan (“I’ll stay with you while you choose an activity”), and gently redirect into engaging play. We avoid prolonged goodbyes (which often increases distress) and coordinate with you on timing, cues, and what language works best. If anxiety persists, we set a joint plan with specific goals and check-ins.\n\n(2) **Social-emotional development, conflict resolution**\n- We explicitly teach skills like naming feelings, turn-taking, waiting, and repair (“What can we do to help?”).\n- Teachers coach in the moment using simple steps: **pause for safety**, **label emotions**, **state the problem**, **support solutions** (trade, take turns with a timer, find another material, ask for help), and **guide repair** if someone is hurt/upset.\n- We reinforce positive peer interactions (kind words, gentle hands) and use consistent classroom language so children internalize expectations.\n\n(3) **Parent updates / communication cadence**\n- **Daily:** quick handover at pickup/drop-off with key highlights (mood, meals, naps/rest, notable moments).\n- **Ongoing:** periodic photos/notes about classroom themes and activities (with consent) plus practical reminders.\n- **Conferences:** scheduled conferences during the year, and we’re available for ad-hoc check-ins if something comes up.\n\nTo tailor this to your child: how old are they, and what’s their typical separation pattern (e.g., do they warm up quickly, or need longer transitions)?

Happy to clarify how we think about fit and timing.\n\n**What we prioritize when selecting families**\nWe aim for a stable, consistent placement where a child can settle well. In practice, we weigh:\n- **Start-date and schedule fit** (whether we can reliably accommodate the days/hours you need)\n- **Readiness/fit for a group setting** (e.g., ability to separate with support, comfort with routines—this is never “perfect,” just a sense of alignment)\n- **Communication partnership** (families who value consistent routines and two-way communication)\n- **Timing/commitment** (when a family is ready to confirm if offered a place)\n\nWe don’t require “extra” priorities like siblings in our current process unless explicitly stated in the wider allocation rules; our main focus is schedule/availability and a good, stable match.\n\n**Expectations on start date & hours**\n- **Start date:** Ideally within the next available intake window (we can be flexible by a few weeks if needed, but we do prefer clarity so we can plan staffing and settling-in).\n- **Hours/days:** We generally work best with **consistent weekly attendance** (same days each week). If you need extended hours or specific pickup/drop-off constraints, it’s important to confirm those early.\n\nIf you share (1) your preferred **start date**, (2) the **days per week** and typical **drop-off/pick-up times**, and (3) any non-negotiables (work schedule, commute, etc.), I can tell you quickly whether we’re a strong fit.\n\nAnd if it does look compatible, I’d encourage you to submit a formal **[APPLY]** promptly this round/next—timing matters in a quota-1 environment.",
