Nursery_B is my top choice but is likely already matched by now; Nursery_D I already applied to earlier and may have been rejected or is pending but given we are at round 5 and only Nursery_A and Nursery_E remain unmatched, Nursery_D is presumably matched. I should now try to secure Nursery_A rather than risk ending up at Nursery_E (4th) or unmatched. Importantly, Nursery_A’s priority ranking puts Parent_B first, so if I apply now while they are still unmatched, I have an excellent chance of acceptance. I previously only talked to Nursery_A, so I am allowed to apply."
