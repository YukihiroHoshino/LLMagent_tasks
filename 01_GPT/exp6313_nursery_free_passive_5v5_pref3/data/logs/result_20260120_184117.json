We can accommodate common dietary needs with advance planning.\n• Nap/quiet time: A daily rest period is built in; children who don’t sleep have quiet activities.\n• Communication: We provide regular updates (daily highlights on routines, meals/naps, and notable moments), plus scheduled check-ins—especially during the first weeks—to ensure a smooth adjustment.\n\nTo tailor this to your family and confirm the most relevant details, could you share: your child’s age, the start date you’re aiming for, and whether you need full-day or part-day care?

Children who nap can sleep; children who don’t are offered calm activities (books, puzzles) so no one is forced to sleep. For meals, we provide a morning snack; lunch is typically packed from home to accommodate preferences/allergies (we can share our “nut-aware” guidelines and storage/heating details). We keep mealtimes relaxed and encourage independence (serving, tidying) with staff support.\n\n3) Settling-in / transition: We use a gradual settling-in plan over ~1–2 weeks depending on the child. Usually it starts with a short visit with a parent/caregiver present, then brief separations, then building to a half-day and full day. We assign a key teacher to be the main point of contact, and we’ll coordinate a consistent goodbye routine and comfort plan.

We keep transitions predictable (visual cues, songs, consistent routines).\n\n(2) **First 1–2 weeks / transition:** we focus on emotional safety and relationship-building—consistent key staff, clear goodbye routines, and frequent family updates. Depending on the child, we may recommend a gradual start (shorter days at first) or a consistent full schedule; we decide that together after an initial observation/visit.\n\n**Next steps & timeline:** decisions are made on a rolling basis as we confirm openings and overall fit. At the moment, we’re not in a position to extend an offer, but if circumstances change we would reach out directly. In the meantime, I’d encourage you to continue pursuing your other options as well.\n\nIf you’d like, you can share your ideal schedule (days/hours) and preferred start window, and I can confirm whether it aligns with any potential upcoming availability.",

If you apply soon, we can usually give you a clear answer relatively quickly rather than waiting for a single “decision day.”\n\nWhat matters most in our selection:\n• Schedule + start-date fit: Matching your needed days/hours and a realistic start window is a major factor.\n• Age-group availability: Openings depend on the classroom/age group.\n• Child/family fit with our program: We look for alignment with a play-based approach, consistent routines, and collaborative communication.\n• Flexibility helps: Your note that you can be flexible on start date/logistics is definitely a plus because it increases the chance we can place you in the right group at the right time.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing two quick details, I can tell you how this looks for your family and what the likely next step/timing would be:\n1) Your child’s age (or birth month/year)\n2) The schedule you need (full-day vs part-day; which days)\n\nIf Nursery_E is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply as your next step—then we can move you into the review/visit stage and give you a concrete timeline based on your child’s age group and your preferred start window.",

We assign a key teacher, agree on a consistent goodbye routine/comfort plan, and send frequent updates during the first days.\n\n3) Next steps & timeline: If you’d like, we can confirm enrollment immediately. The next step is to schedule a short visit (or phone call if easier) within the next few days to confirm start date, required hours, and any health/allergy or support needs. After that, we’ll send the enrollment packet (forms + document checklist) and confirm the settling-in schedule.\n\nIf you reply with your child’s age, your preferred start date, and the hours you need, I’ll propose a specific 1–2 week transition plan and book your visit time.",
