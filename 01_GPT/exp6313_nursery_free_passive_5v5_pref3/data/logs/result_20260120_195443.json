Check likelihood: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd (after C, A) and may apply later if rejected elsewhere; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th, less likely.

We also look for families who can commit to regular attendance and clear, timely communication when plans change.\n\nDaily routine & approach: we follow a play-based, structured day (morning welcome, free play/learning centers, circle time, outdoor play, lunch/rest, afternoon activities). We emphasize kindness, independence skills, and language development through guided play and small-group activities.\n\nHours: we operate on a standard school-day schedule with optional early/late care depending on availability (we can confirm exact times based on your needs).\n\nCommunication: daily quick updates at pick-up plus periodic written updates; we also schedule parent check-ins to discuss progress and goals.\n\nTo help me advise you best: what hours/coverage do you need, and what are the top 2–3 things you’re looking for in a nursery (e.g., outdoor time, academics, flexibility, proximity)?",
