Check feasibility of Nursery_A: Nursery_A priority ranks me 4th (behind Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A). Those parents likely matched already given only A and E remain, but I cannot be sure. Nursery_E priority ranks me 4th as well (behind Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_B). If those higher-priority parents are already matched, I have a decent chance. Since E is on my list and time is advancing, I should apply now rather than risk losing the remaining seat."

A nurturing environment and strong family communication are core to Nursery_E, and we’d be glad to welcome your family.\n\nWe are happy to confirm your placement for our available spot. Next steps: please reply with your child’s age, any allergies/support needs, and your preferred start date, and we’ll send the enrollment/confirmation details and arrange a brief onboarding chat.\n\nWe’re looking forward to partnering with you.",

In the current market, only Parent_B and Parent_E remain unmatched and I have one seat. Holding out for Parent_B (ranked higher) is risky because Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th and may match elsewhere; accepting Parent_E secures a match with an acceptable parent. Therefore, accept Parent_E now."
