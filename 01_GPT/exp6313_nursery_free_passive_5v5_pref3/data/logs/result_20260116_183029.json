If you tell me your child’s age, I can share the most relevant group setup and what a typical day looks like for that age.\n\nSocial-emotional learning (SEL) & routines\n- Predictable rhythm: we use consistent daily routines (arrival, play blocks, cleanup, meals, rest, outdoor) because predictability reduces stress and supports independence.\n- Emotion coaching: we help children name feelings (“you look frustrated”), practice regulation strategies (breathing, a calm corner, sensory tools), and repair after conflict.\n- Pro-social skills: teachers model language for turn-taking, asking for space, joining play, and problem-solving (“What can we do so both of you feel okay?”). We intervene early to keep everyone safe, then guide children toward repair.\n- Positive boundaries: clear, calm limits with follow-through—firm on safety/kindness, gentle on mistakes.\n\nWhat we value most in families\n- Partnership and respectful communication—especially when we’re problem-solving.\n- Consistency and reliability (drop-off/pick-up, sharing changes at home that might affect the day).\n- Openness to a shared approach to routines and behavior support so home and school can reinforce each other.\n\nTo help me assess fit: what’s your child’s age and temperament (more slow-to-warm or eager-to-join?), and are there any routines (sleep, separation at drop-off, food) that are especially important right now?

A key person/lead teacher helps your child settle, and we encourage a short, confident goodbye so children learn the rhythm quickly.\n- Between activities: We give clear “warnings” (e.g., 5-minute/2-minute reminders), use songs/visual cues, and offer small helper roles to make transitions feel positive and purposeful.\n- Nap/rest: We keep a calm, consistent wind-down (story, soft music, comfort items if needed). Children who don’t sleep are supported with quiet rest/quiet activities so the room stays peaceful.\n\n3) Day-to-day communication with families\n- Daily: quick in-person handoff at drop-off/pick-up plus a short daily update (what we did, mood, meals, nap/rest, any notable moments).\n- Ongoing: we’re easy to reach for anything important, and we proactively message/call if there’s a concern we want to partner on.\n\nIf you share your child’s age and anything that tends to make transitions harder/easier (separation, sensory needs, nap habits), I can describe exactly how we’d support them.\n\nAnd candidly—Nursery_E would be genuinely excited to consider your family.
