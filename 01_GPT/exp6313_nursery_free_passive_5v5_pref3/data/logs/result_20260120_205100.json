That said, **if you apply soon, you will be fully considered while the spot is still open**.\n\n3) **What to highlight to show fit:** The strongest applications help us understand:\n- **Your child’s age and temperament** (what helps them settle, interests, any sensitivities)\n- How your family feels about a **play-based approach with gentle structure**\n- Your ability to support **consistent routines/attendance** (drop-off/pick-up reliability, comfort with predictable daily rhythm)\n- Openness to **collaborative communication** (sharing strategies that work at home; partnering on social-emotional skills)\n- Any goals you have for your child this year (language, independence/self-care, peer interaction)\n\nIf you’d like, share 2–3 lines about your child (age + what environment they thrive in), and I can tell you candidly whether Nursery_E sounds like a strong match—and if it does, I’d encourage you to **apply this round** so we can make a timely decision.",
