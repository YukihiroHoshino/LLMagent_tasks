We encourage a calm, confident goodbye (brief but warm), and we’ll help with a predictable separation routine (wave at the window, choose a book, etc.).\n- During the day: we rely on visual cues, songs/short warnings (“2 more minutes”), and small-group transitions when possible so children aren’t rushed. For children who need it, we use individualized supports (comfort object, first/then language, extra time).\n\nCommunication with families\n- Daily: quick in-person handoff at drop-off/pick-up when possible, plus a short daily update (meals, nap/rest, mood, and a highlight from the day). We can also share photos/notes depending on the day’s flow.\n- Ongoing: we’re responsive by message/email for questions, and we like to schedule check-ins as needed—especially during the first few weeks to make sure the transition is going smoothly.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants/families\n- Partnership and communication: sharing what works at home and being open to collaborating on routines (sleep, toileting, separation, etc.).\n- Consistency and kindness: families who align with gentle, respectful guidance and understand that social skills take practice.\n- Practical info up front: allergies/medical needs, languages spoken at home, comfort strategies, and anything that helps us support your child.\n\nIf you’re open to it, it would help to know:\n1) your child’s age and temperament (slow-to-warm vs. jump-right-in),\n2) typical nap schedule and any comfort routines at drop-off,\n3) what you’re prioritizing most in a nursery setting.\n\nAlso, where are you in your decision process—are you considering submitting an application to Nursery_B soon, or are you still gathering information across a few schools?",

Our early learning focuses on social-emotional development, language-rich play, early numeracy/literacy through hands-on activities, and independence skills (self-help routines, turn-taking, tidy-up, etc.). We aim for a calm, structured environment where children know what to expect.\n\nWhat matters in admissions: We prioritize (1) overall fit with our structured routine and classroom expectations, (2) consistency of attendance/schedule and readiness to partner with us on communication and routines, and (3) alignment with our community values (warmth, respect, predictable transitions). Practical constraints like start date and schedule needs also matter for placement.\n\nIf you’re considering applying, it would help to know: your child’s age, desired start date, and the weekly schedule you need (full-time/part-time, drop-off/pick-up windows).
