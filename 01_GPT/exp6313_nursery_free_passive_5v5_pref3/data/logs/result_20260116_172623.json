We focus on social-emotional skills (independence, kindness, routines), communication, and curiosity—children learn best through hands-on exploration.\n\n**Hours:** Our standard day is **8:30–16:30** (with **early drop-off from 8:00** and **late pickup to 17:30** depending on availability).

We also appreciate families who can commit to timely drop-off/pick-up and keep us informed about any changes at home that might affect a child’s day.\n\nA few questions to help us understand fit:\n1) What’s your child’s age and current care setting?\n2) Any allergies, dietary needs, or support needs we should know about?\n3) What matters most to you—outdoor time, academics/early literacy, social development, hours, or something else?\n\nIf Nursery_E feels like a strong fit after this, you’re very welcome to apply—we’d be happy to consider your application promptly.",
