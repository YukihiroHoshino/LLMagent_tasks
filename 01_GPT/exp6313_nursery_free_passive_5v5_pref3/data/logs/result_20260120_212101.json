Children are supported by a key person who knows their routines and helps them feel secure. In the room, staff actively observe and join play to extend learning (e.g., adding vocabulary, turn-taking prompts, problem-solving), while also giving children space to initiate and lead.\n\nSocial-emotional development:\nWe explicitly support:\n- emotion recognition and regulation (naming feelings, calming strategies, quiet spaces)\n- friendship skills (sharing, turn-taking, repairing after conflict)\n- positive boundaries (clear, predictable expectations)\nWe use gentle, consistent guidance and model language children can use with peers.\n\nPlay and early learning:\nOur approach is play-based with intentional teaching moments—teachers set up invitations to play and small-group experiences aligned to children’s interests, then extend learning through questions, storytelling, counting in context, and hands-on exploration.\n\nSettling-in / transitions:\nWe use a gradual, child-led settling-in over ~1–3 weeks (tailored to the child). Typically:\n- short visits with a parent/carer present\n- brief separations once the child is ready\n- building up to a full session\nYour child’s key person stays closely involved to build trust and keep routines consistent.\n\nCommunication with families:\n- quick daily handovers at drop-off/pick-up\n- regular updates about wellbeing and progress\n- scheduled check-ins, especially during the first weeks\n- we partner with families on strategies that work at home (sleep, separation, comfort routines, etc.)\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise you well: What is your child’s age, and have they had prior group-care experience? Also, are you looking for a start date soon?\n\nIf after this you feel Nursery_A is the right fit, you’re very welcome to apply to Nursery_A—we can move quickly once we receive an application.\n\n[TALK]",

I previously only TALKed with E (twice), signaling interest but not commitment. I already applied to Nursery_D (my 2nd choice) and should still prioritize that, but to avoid ending unmatched if D/B don’t work out, it’s worth converting E interest into an application now. Nursery_E’s priority ranks me 3rd (A, C, B, E, D), so I’m competitive but not top; an early firm application may help if they’re deciding among remaining parents. Applying doesn’t preclude later outcomes in this simplified negotiation setting; if accepted, I secure a decent fallback."

Since this is the final round, I want to confirm as clearly as possible that if you are able to offer us the place, we will accept immediately and complete any paperwork today.\n\nWe can reliably meet drop-off/pick-up times, are flexible on start date and settling-in schedule, and can send any remaining items right away (schedule confirmation, emergency contacts, references, brief transition plan). If there is one specific detail you still need to finalize your decision, please tell me and I will provide it immediately.",

Please include (briefly is fine):\n- Exact days/hours needed (and any flexibility)\n- Confirm start date (e.g., “can start on your preferred date”)\n- Any allergies/medical notes (or “none”)\n- One emergency contact name + phone number\n- A short settling-in note (what helps your child separate/settle)\n\nIf you send that [APPLY] immediately, we’ll be able to confirm straight away on receipt.",
