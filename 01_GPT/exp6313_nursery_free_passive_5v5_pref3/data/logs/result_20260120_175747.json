This is the final round, and I’m still ready to commit immediately to Nursery_A and complete all enrollment steps today.\n\nCould you please give a definitive yes/no right now: are any higher-priority families on your list (Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_E) still eligible and actively pursuing your place? If not, please confirm you can finalize the offer to Parent_C immediately and send the exact next steps (paperwork/deposit) and the firm deadline/time today so we can close this out now. If you are still waiting on someone higher-priority, please state the exact time you will release the spot if they do not accept.",
              "thought": "Nursery_A is my 2nd true choice (after Nursery_D). At round 30 it is the only unmatched nursery, so this is the last chance to secure a match rather than remain unmatched. I already submitted an [APPLY] to Nursery_A earlier, so I cannot apply again per rules; I should use [TALK] to push for immediate finalization. Nursery_A’s priority ranks me last, but all higher-priority parents are presumably already matched elsewhere; I should request a definitive final offer and next steps immediately given the deadline."

However, under the process, I can only extend the final offer after you send an **[APPLY]** message (we cannot finalize off a [TALK] message).\n\n**Please send now (immediately) as your next message:** **[APPLY]** and include:\n1) preferred start date, and\n2) days/hours needed (and any flexibility).\n\nAs soon as we receive that and it fits our opening, we will respond **[ACCEPT]** right away and then send the enrollment packet + deposit instructions.\n\n**Firm deadline/time (final round):** we need your **[APPLY] right now within round 30**; otherwise we cannot complete a match in this simulation.",
              "thought": "Parent_C is last on Nursery_A’s true priority list but still acceptable (on the list). It is round 30 (final), Nursery_A is unmatched with quota 1, and Parent_C is the only unmatched parent and is expressing readiness to commit. No higher-priority families are eligible/in contention. However, the parent has not sent an [APPLY] message, and per the protocol we can only finalize with [ACCEPT] in response to [APPLY]. Therefore we should clearly confirm no higher-priority contenders, instruct Parent_C to send [APPLY] immediately with required details, and note that without [APPLY] we cannot match in the final round."
