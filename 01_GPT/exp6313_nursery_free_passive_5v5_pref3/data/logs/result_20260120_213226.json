For social-emotional skills, we focus on:\n- **Emotion labeling and co-regulation** (“I see you’re frustrated; let’s breathe together, then we’ll try again.”)\n- **Clear, consistent boundaries** (kind hands/words, turn-taking expectations)\n- **Problem-solving scripts** (asking for a turn, offering a trade, using a timer, seeking teacher help)\n- **Repair and empathy** (checking on peers, making amends after conflict)\nWe use positive guidance and calm, consistent follow-through rather than punitive approaches.\n\n2) **Communication with families**\nWe aim for frequent, practical communication:\n- **Daily handoff** at drop-off/pick-up (quick highlights and any needs)\n- **Brief updates** as needed (e.g., appetite, sleep/rest, big moments or challenges)\n- **Regular check-ins** when a child is settling in or if we’re working on a specific goal\n- **Scheduled conferences** (and additional meetings anytime there’s something we should align on)\nWe value a two-way partnership—what you’re seeing at home helps us support your child well.\n\n3) **Opening this cycle**\nYes—**we anticipate one opening** this cycle, and we expect to move from conversations to decisions soon.\n\n**What we look for most in families**\nThe strongest fit is families who value collaboration, consistency with routines (especially transitions), and open communication—plus a schedule/start timeline that aligns with our program.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, I can advise on fit and next steps quickly:\n- Your child’s **age** and temperament (slow-to-warm-up/energetic/sensitive, etc.)\n- Your preferred **start date**\n- The **schedule** you need (days/hours)\n\nAnd if Nursery_D is moving into your top choice tier, you’re welcome to **apply** now—then we can move promptly given the single opening.",

Only Nursery_D and Nursery_E remain unmatched in round 5, so my best outcome now is to secure something rather than risk ending unmatched.

I have not contacted Nursery_E before, so I should apply directly and signal readiness to commit immediately."

If you still have one opening, I would like to formally apply and be considered for admission.",

To avoid ending up with my last choice (E) or risking being unmatched if D fills, I should apply now. Nursery_D’s priority list ranks me 2nd (after Parent_D), and Parent_D is likely already matched elsewhere given only D and E are left. That makes acceptance highly likely, so applying is the best move."
