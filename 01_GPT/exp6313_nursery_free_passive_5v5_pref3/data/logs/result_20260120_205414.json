We focus on social-emotional skills, communication, independence, and curiosity—lots of hands-on materials, outdoor time, and consistent routines.\n\n• Hours & flexibility: we offer standard full-day hours with options for early drop-off/late pickup on most days, and we can discuss part-time schedules depending on availability.\n\nA couple of quick questions so I can advise fit/availability: what hours would you ideally need, and what age is your child?

We also put emphasis on social-emotional skills—cooperation, self-regulation, and confidence—alongside early numeracy/literacy foundations.\n\nWhat we prioritize in admissions: We aim for a cohort that will thrive in our setting. We look closely at (1) family fit with our daily routines and values, (2) readiness for group-based learning and play, and (3) clear communication from families about what they’re seeking and how they’ll partner with us through the year.\n\nKey steps to complete early: If Nursery_D is a serious option for you, the most helpful early steps are:\n- Schedule/attend a visit (or short call) so we can understand your child’s needs and what you’re looking for.\n- Share any relevant context early (schedule needs, support needs, languages spoken at home, etc.).\n- If/when you’re ready, submitting an application sooner rather than later helps ensure you’re fully considered as we begin filling our limited seats.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what matters most to your family (hours, teaching style, outdoor time, classroom structure), and I can be more specific about how Nursery_D compares to what you’re considering.",
