We also incorporate short “fresh air” breaks when possible.\n\n**Teacher–child ratio**\n- We staff to age-appropriate ratios; as a guide: **toddlers ~1:4–1:5**, **preschool ~1:7–1:8** (varies slightly by room composition and support staff). If you share your child’s age and start date, I can give the exact room/ratio you’d be entering.\n\n**Settling-in / transition**\n- We do a **graduated settling-in** over ~**1–2 weeks**: initial short parent-and-child visits, then brief separations, building up to full sessions at the child’s pace. You’ll have a key person/lead educator and we’ll align on routines (sleep, comfort items, drop-off plan).\n\n**Commitment timeline**\n- If we offer a place, we typically ask for a decision within **5–7 days** so we can plan staffing and confirm the room list.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can advise you accurately: **(1)** your child’s age (and desired start month), and **(2)** what hours you ideally need (earliest drop-off / latest pick-up).
