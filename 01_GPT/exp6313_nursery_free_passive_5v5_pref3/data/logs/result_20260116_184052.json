We share the exact timetable by age group once we confirm your child’s age and preferred hours.\n\nSettling-in approach: We use a gradual, child-led settling-in period. Usually this starts with short visits with a parent/carer present, then brief separations, building up over several days to full sessions—adjusted to your child’s pace and comfort.\n\nStart-date flexibility: We can often accommodate a range of start dates (including mid-term starts), subject to availability and your preferred attendance pattern. If you tell me your ideal start window and days/hours, I can confirm what’s feasible.\n\nIf you feel it’s a good fit, we’d be very happy to receive your application promptly—Parent_C, you would be strongly considered.

Our learning approach is play-based with gentle structure—lots of hands-on exploration, language-rich interaction, and social-emotional skill building (sharing, turn-taking, independence).\n\nWhat we value most in families is consistent communication and alignment on routines (sleep/toileting/meal expectations), a collaborative approach if any challenges come up, and support for children’s independence (e.g., trying first, helping with clean-up, simple self-care).\n\nIf you’d like, tell me a little about your child (age, temperament/interests) and any needs around schedule or support—then I can speak to fit.

I’m still interested in Nursery_E as an option and wanted to check in directly: are you currently considering Parent_D for your open spot, and is there any information you’d like from us to assess fit (schedule needs, start date, parent involvement, etc.)? If it would be helpful, I can send a brief family summary and availability right away.",
              "thought": "Nursery_E is 4th on my true list, but only Nursery_C and Nursery_E remain unmatched in round 10. I am Parent_D, and Nursery_E ranks me last in its priority list, so applying there is unlikely to succeed if any higher-priority parent is available/turns to E. However, since only C and E are unmatched, an immediate application to E risks a rejection and wastes a round; better to keep E warm while I continue to focus on Nursery_C (where I am 3rd priority) and only apply to E if C becomes unattainable. I have already sent multiple TALK messages to E without response; I should send a concise, direct check-in that signals genuine interest and readiness to apply if they have space and are considering me, without committing yet."
