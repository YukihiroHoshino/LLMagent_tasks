We balance child-led exploration with gentle structure so children feel secure and confident.\n\n**What we value in development:** We focus on social-emotional growth (kindness, self-regulation, cooperation), communication/language, and independence in everyday skills. We also emphasize play-based learning—curiosity, problem-solving, and creativity—because that’s where we see children thrive.\n\n**Communication with parents:** We prioritize clear, two-way communication. You can expect regular updates (daily notes/brief check-ins at pick-up, plus periodic progress conversations). If anything comes up—big or small—we reach out promptly and work collaboratively.\n\n**Transition for new students:** We use a gradual, child-centered transition: an initial orientation, short visits if helpful, and a consistent key-person approach so your child builds trust with a familiar adult. We coordinate closely with you on routines, comfort items, and any sensitivities to make the first weeks smoother.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me what matters most to your family (schedule needs, temperament, any goals for the year).

We coordinate closely with you on routines, separation strategies, and any sensitivities, and we communicate early and often during the first weeks.\n\nIf you think you may circle back after your next steps, I’d be happy to hold a short call or invite you for a visit.
