I’m happy to share more about Nursery_D.\n\n**About our program:** We focus on a warm, structured day with plenty of play-based learning (language, early numeracy, art/music, outdoor time) plus consistent routines that support social-emotional growth and independence. We keep communication with families frequent and practical (regular updates and quick check-ins as needed).\n\n**What we prioritize in applicants:** We look for strong family–school partnership (responsiveness and collaboration), alignment with our routines/values (kindness, respect, consistency), and a clear plan for supporting the child’s development and well-being.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can tailor details:\n1) What are you most prioritizing this year (schedule/extended care, curriculum style, outdoor time, communication, etc.)?\n2) Any specific needs or goals for your child that you’d like us to support?\n\nIf Nursery_D feels like a good fit after this, I’d be glad to have you consider applying.",

I’m happy to share more about Nursery_E.\n\nDaily routine: We keep a predictable rhythm—warm welcome/free play on arrival, a short morning circle (songs, stories, sharing), extended play-based learning time (indoors/outdoors), lunch, rest/quiet time, then afternoon small-group activities and outdoor play before pick-up.\n\nApproach to learning/play: We’re play-based and child-led, with educators setting up “invitations to play” that build early language, social-emotional skills, and foundational numeracy/literacy through hands-on activities (blocks, art, pretend play, sensory play). We observe children’s interests and extend them with gentle guidance and small-group moments.\n\nSupporting transitions: For new children we use a gradual settling-in plan (short initial visits that lengthen over time), a consistent key-person approach, and close communication with families. We also use visual routines, comfort objects if helpful, and daily check-ins so children feel secure.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can advise on fit and availability: What age is your child, and what start date/timetable are you aiming for? Also, what matters most to you (e.g., outdoor time, structure, language support, separation transition)? If you decide to apply later, I can explain the steps and expected timing as well.",

If you share your preferred start week and your child’s usual hours (e.g., mornings only vs. full day), we’ll lock in a plan.\n\nSettling-in (first 1–2 weeks): We use a key-person approach from day one, so your child has a consistent primary educator. Our settling-in is phased and individualized, but a common pattern is:\n- Days 1–2: Short visits with you present (30–60 minutes), exploring the room and meeting the key person.\n- Days 3–5: Gradual separation—brief drop-offs that increase in length (e.g., 1–2 hours), with a predictable goodbye routine.\n- Week 2: Extend toward the intended schedule, adding lunch/rest as your child is ready.\nWe stay in close contact during this period (quick updates at drop-off/pick-up, and we can message/call if helpful), and we welcome comfort items and consistent routines to support a smooth transition.\n\nIf you reply with (1) your child’s age, (2) preferred start date, and (3) desired weekly schedule, I’ll confirm the proposed settling-in timetable and next steps.",
