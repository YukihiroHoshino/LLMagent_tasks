We support individual sleep needs within a consistent routine.\n- **Afternoon:** quieter activities after rest, small-group projects/art, then another play/outdoor period when possible.\n\n**What we prioritize when considering families:**\n- **Schedule fit & reliability:** consistent drop-off/pick-up and predictable weekly attendance.\n- **Communication style:** responsive, respectful, and proactive collaboration if needs arise.\n- **Alignment on guidance:** warm, firm boundaries and consistency between home and school.\n- **Transition readiness/support:** we like to understand what helps your child separate and settle (comfort items, routines, sensitivities).\n(We don’t use distance as a strict rule, and siblings can be helpful context, but the day-to-day fit matters most.)\n\nIf you’re prepared to apply promptly, I’d love to confirm a few details so we can advise realistically:\n1) Preferred **start date**\n2) Needed **days/hours** each week\n3) Any notes on your child’s **nap needs/temperament/separation experience**\n4) Where does Nursery_D sit on your list right now (e.g., top 1–2 vs. one of several)?\n\nIf those align, submitting an application soon is the right next step and we can move quickly on a review.",
