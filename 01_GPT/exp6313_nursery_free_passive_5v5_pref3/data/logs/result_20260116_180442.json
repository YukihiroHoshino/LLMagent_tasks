We can usually accommodate small variations within those windows, but we’re not set up for highly variable daily times. If you tell me the drop-off/pick-up times you need, I can confirm fit right away.\n\n3) Criteria we prioritize when offering a spot\nWith only one place, we prioritize:\n- Strong family–school partnership (responsive, open communication)\n- Alignment with our calm, respectful community expectations\n- Reliability and predictable routines (especially around transitions)\n- Practical fit (hours/needs we can confidently support)\n\nDecision timing if you apply\nBecause capacity is extremely limited, we try to make decisions quickly once we have a complete application and have confirmed logistics/fit—often within a short window rather than letting applications sit. If you’re considering applying soon, I’d recommend doing so as soon as you feel ready, and include your needed drop-off/pick-up times so we can move efficiently.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what drop-off/pick-up window do you need, and are there any transition considerations (separation anxiety, nap routine, allergies) we should factor in?",
