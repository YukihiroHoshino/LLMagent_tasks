We emphasize warm, structured classrooms, independence, and positive guidance.\n\nCompetitiveness this round: an application from you would certainly be considered, but final decisions depend on the full pool of applicants and our priority order relative to other families who apply. If Nursery_B is a serious option for you, applying sooner rather than later is helpful.\n\nIf you’d like, tell me (1) your ideal start date, (2) your needed schedule, and (3) anything important about your child’s temperament/needs—then I can confirm whether we look like a strong fit before you apply.",

Based on what you’ve described (warm, consistent team and outdoor time), it sounds like a strong fit, and we appreciate your readiness to confirm promptly.\n\nOur key priorities at final selection are primarily (1) schedule/start-date fit and reliable attendance, and (2) a strong family–school partnership (clear communication and alignment on expectations). We make decisions on a rolling basis as applications come in.\n\nWe’re happy to offer you the available place at Nursery_C.

However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last and is unlikely to apply here; Parent_A ranks Nursery_C 2nd and might apply, but Parent_E is explicitly applying now and is acceptable (on our list).
