If you apply, it’s helpful to include: your child’s **age**, desired **start timing**, and any **schedule needs** (standard day/extended care), plus anything important for a smooth transition.\n\nIf you’re prepared to move promptly, I’d encourage you to **apply in the next round** so we can seriously consider you while the seat is still available.
