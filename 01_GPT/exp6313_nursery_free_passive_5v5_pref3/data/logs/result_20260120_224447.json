We’d be happy to offer you our available spot at Nursery_B.\n\nTo finalize enrollment, please reply with:\n1) Your child’s age and any key routine notes (sleep/separation/toileting),\n2) Your preferred start date and weekly schedule (days + drop-off/pick-up window), and\n3) Any allergies/medical or support needs we should plan for.\n\nOnce we have that, we’ll send the enrollment packet for signature and next steps.",

Accepting secures a match within quota and ends the search. We can accept while immediately confirming schedule/start date details to ensure fit."
