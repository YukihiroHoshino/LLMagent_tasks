We balance child-led play with gentle structure so children feel secure and engaged.\n\nApproach to learning/play: Our focus is play-based learning with intentional support for language, early numeracy, social-emotional skills, and independence. Teachers observe children’s interests and design activities that extend curiosity (e.g., sensory play, art, music/movement, blocks, early literacy through stories and conversation).\n\nCommunication with parents: We prioritize frequent, practical communication—brief daily updates at drop-off/pick-up, regular messages/notes about highlights and needs, and scheduled check-ins as needed. We also share periodic summaries of developmental goals and classroom themes.\n\nAdmissions steps/dates this round: If you decide we’re a strong fit, the next step is to submit an application in this round; we then confirm placement based on priorities and availability (we have limited capacity). If you’d like, tell me your child’s age and any key needs (schedule, allergies, support needs), and I can also explain how we’d accommodate them.\n\nIf Nursery_D is among your top choices, I encourage you to apply as soon as you’re comfortable—I'd be very glad to consider your application.",
