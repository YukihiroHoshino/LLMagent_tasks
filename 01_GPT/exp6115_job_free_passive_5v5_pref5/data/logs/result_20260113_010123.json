Company_E is mid-ranked (4th) on Seeker_A’s preference list, so I need to reduce uncertainty, show speed, and make the role sound concrete. With only 1 quota and no matches yet, securing Seeker_A would be optimal; I should answer clearly, highlight outcomes/skills, give an accelerated timeline, and invite an APPLY this round."
