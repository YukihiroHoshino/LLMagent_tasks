(2) what environment do you do your best work in—more ambiguous/0→1, or more scaling/optimization?\n\nIf what I described matches what you’re looking for, I’d encourage you to apply—we’re very interested in candidates who can drive outcomes quickly and collaborate cross-functionally.",

To maximize chance of matching, we should make a definitive commitment contingent only on receiving references + an [APPLY] message immediately, and be explicit that we will [ACCEPT] as soon as they do.
