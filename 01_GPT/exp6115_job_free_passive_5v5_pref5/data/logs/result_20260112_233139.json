With quota 1 and remaining unmatched seekers A, B, E, we should avoid committing to E while we may still have a chance at Seeker_A (ranked 2nd) or Seeker_D (ranked 1st but already matched elsewhere/not available). Seeker_E has shown strong interest in us (we are their #2), so keep them warm via [TALK] and request the most decision-critical evidence (end-to-end ownership) without offering acceptance. This preserves optionality while maintaining engagement."
