Given where things are in the process, I’m genuinely interested in moving forward with you and can make a quick decision if there’s mutual fit.\n\nTo confirm alignment before I submit a formal application: (1) what are the top outcomes you need from this hire in the first 60 days, and (2) are you planning to extend an offer as soon as you identify the right person this week/early next week? If so, I’m ready to proceed on an accelerated timeline.",
