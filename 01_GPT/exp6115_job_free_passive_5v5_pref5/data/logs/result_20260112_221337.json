If those align, I’d encourage you to apply this round and we’ll prioritize a fast process on our side.",

Seeker_E already applied and we rejected; Seeker_B is lowest on our list. Best move is to provide clear 60–90 day responsibilities, what success looks like, and ask for 1–2 concrete examples, while signaling we can move fast if there’s mutual fit."
