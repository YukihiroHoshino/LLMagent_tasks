Deliver at least one “quick win” to prove momentum.\n- Days 31–60: lead a scoped project with clear success metrics, coordinate stakeholders, and iterate based on feedback/data.\n- Days 61–90: own a larger initiative or roadmap slice, establish a steady operating rhythm, and demonstrate sustained impact (e.g., reliability, cycle time, customer outcomes—depending on the area).\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of work helps you contribute fastest (e.g., building new features, improving performance/reliability, process/automation, customer-facing problem solving), and what are your top 1–2 criteria in choosing a company right now?",

Success looks like: a crisp plan, tighter coordination across partners, and a measurable improvement (cycle time, quality, or throughput) with simple reporting that stakeholders can trust.\n2) Turning ambiguity into shipped improvements: There are a few “known pain points” in our process/product where the right person can quickly diagnose root causes, propose options with tradeoffs, and drive one improvement into production (or into a new operating cadence) within 60–90 days.\n\nBackground that tends to succeed here\n- Demonstrated end-to-end ownership (you’ve led a project/workstream from scoping → alignment → execution → measurement)\n- Strong stakeholder management (comfortable aligning multiple teams, surfacing risks early, and keeping comms tight)\n- Data-informed problem solving (you don’t need to be a pure analyst, but you can define metrics, instrument/track, and use evidence to decide)\n- Comfort operating in changing priorities (you can re-plan without losing momentum)\n\nHiring timeline\n- We’re moving quickly this round: if there’s mutual fit, we can go from application → decision in ~1–2 rounds of conversations. We’re prioritizing candidates who can commit to a process promptly.\n\nIf you’re weighing options, one thing that would help me assess fit fast: what’s the closest example you have to (a) reducing cycle time / improving a process with measurable impact, or (b) driving a cross-functional initiative under ambiguity? A 4–6 sentence snapshot is perfect. If it maps well, I’d encourage you to apply this round so we can keep momentum.",
