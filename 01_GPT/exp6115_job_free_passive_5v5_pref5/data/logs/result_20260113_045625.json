Seeker_E ranks Company_A 3rd, but an acceptance finalizes the match and prevents losing them to Company_C or Company_D if they apply elsewhere. Therefore accept and actively appeal by outlining 60–90 day outcomes and next steps."

In round 3, the remaining unmatched companies are A, D, and E; my top choices (B, C) are already gone. I have only TALK history with A and E and no commitments. Company_D’s priority list ranks me #1, so if I apply now I’m very likely to secure a match rather than risk ending up with an even worse outcome (unmatched) if A/E fill. Given the market, it’s optimal to apply to D now to lock in a guaranteed match."

We can align quickly and get everything finalized immediately.",
