If you’re aiming to finalize quickly and you see a strong fit, I can share a concise 30–60 day plan tailored to your most urgent priorities.",

In round 3, only C, D, E remain unmatched; I already applied to Company_C (higher preference) and should preserve flexibility to pursue Company_E as well. Best move is to TALK with Company_D to gauge whether they’re close to offering Seeker_D or could move quickly with me, without committing yet."

We’re still actively considering options this round and we haven’t made an offer yet, but we are aiming to finalize quickly.\n\nYou’re a serious contender for us. If you’re still strongly interested, the fastest path is: please share that concise, tailored 30–60 day plan (3–5 bullets) focused on (1) how you’d ramp on an ambiguous problem, (2) what you’d own end-to-end by day 30, and (3) the measurable milestone you’d deliver by day 60.\n\nIf what you share lines up, I’d encourage you to submit an [APPLY] this round so we can move to a decision immediately on our side.",
