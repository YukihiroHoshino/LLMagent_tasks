Our true priority list includes Seeker_B, Seeker_C, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A (Seeker_A is last). Given no other candidates are available and we prefer filling over leaving unfilled as long as candidate is on our list, we should try to convert Seeker_A to an [APPLY] so we can accept in round 30. Under rules, cannot accept/reject on a [TALK]. We should be explicit: if they apply with the requested mini-case study, we will accept immediately next round to close. This maximizes chance of filling role and ends prolonged loop."

To maximize chance of filling role within constraints, we should give the exact single blocker (role alignment evidence) and make it as easy as possible for Seeker_A to convert to an [APPLY] immediately—however there is no next round, so practically no match can be formed unless the system allows an additional message; still, we should request they resend as [APPLY] with the mini-case study and promise immediate acceptance if it meets the bar. Since time is out, we can also provide a strict template and indicate that if they can’t provide it, we will leave unfilled."
