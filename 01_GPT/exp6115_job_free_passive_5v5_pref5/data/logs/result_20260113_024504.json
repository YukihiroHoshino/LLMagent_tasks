However, Seeker_E ranks Company_D as their #2 choice, so acceptance is likely stable. Risk of holding out: Seeker_D and Seeker_A both rank Company_D last, making them unlikely to apply/accept; Seeker_C ranks us #3 and may be contested.

At Company_A I am ranked 4th, making acceptance less likely if higher-priority seekers apply; at Company_B I am ranked 2nd, a decent chance but still competitive.
