Typically it’s (1) a short alignment chat, then (2) one deeper working session/case + stakeholder-style discussion, then (3) decision quickly after—often within ~1–2 weeks depending on scheduling.\n\nIf you’re open to next steps, could you share one project where you took an unclear problem, aligned stakeholders, and delivered a measurable result (what you owned + the metric/outcome)? I can map it directly to what we need and suggest the best next conversation.",
