Specifically: (a) a crisp 1–2 page plan (problem, scope, success metrics, risks, stakeholders), (b) instrumentation/measurement plan in place, and (c) an initial launch or workflow change that creates a measurable leading indicator (even if the full impact takes longer).\n• By Day 90: Deliver the full v1 outcome of that initiative with measurable results, plus establish an execution cadence that sticks (regular stakeholder updates, decision log, and a repeatable experiment/iteration loop). Ideally you’ve also teed up the next 1–2 opportunities with a lightweight roadmap.\n\n(2) Hiring timeline + process\nWe’re moving quickly. From here: one focused deep-dive conversation (scope + execution case), then a final round with 1–2 key cross-functional partners. If there’s strong alignment, we can finalize within ~1 week from the next conversation.\n\nIf you’re open to it, please share that brief role-aligned snapshot (2–4 bullets) mapping to: (a) an end-to-end initiative you owned, (b) how you set/used metrics, and (c) a cross-functional situation you unblocked.

This person would take one of those from “fuzzy” → clear plan → shipped outcome.\n2) **Operating cadence + alignment:** We’re moving quickly and sometimes decisions/ownership aren’t as crisp as they should be. You’d establish lightweight rituals (weekly planning, decision logs, clear owners, risk tracking) so delivery is predictable.\n3) **Stakeholder communication:** We need someone who can proactively surface tradeoffs early, keep partners aligned, and prevent last-minute surprises.\n\n**What strong 30/60/90 looks like:**\n- **30 days:** onboard fast; map stakeholders; identify the highest-leverage workstream; propose a plan with milestones/metrics; start running a simple operating rhythm (updates, risks, decisions).\n- **60 days:** deliver a meaningful milestone (or launch a v1); demonstrate you can unblock dependencies; stakeholders see you as the “driver” who creates clarity.\n- **90 days:** ship a measurable outcome end-to-end (adoption/reliability/cycle-time—depends on the initiative) and leave behind a repeatable process that makes the team faster.\n\n**Process / timing / other candidates:**\nWe’ve spoken with a few candidates, but we’re not “locked in” yet. There is absolutely room to move quickly for a strong match—if we align, we can accelerate and make a decision within ~7–10 days.\n\nIf you’re open, I’d love to calibrate fit quickly: what’s one initiative you’ve driven from ambiguous start to launch, and what metric you used to define success?
