Remaining unmatched seekers are B, C, E; our top choice is Seeker_E (1st) who also prefers Company_A as their 3rd choice, so there is a meaningful chance we could match with E if we wait. However, we have quota 1 and no current match; Seeker_B ranks us #1 and is applying now, which is a strong, reliable option and reduces risk of ending unmatched if Seeker_E matches elsewhere (Company_C ranks E 4th; Company_D ranks E 4th; Company_B ranks E 1st and may capture E). Given the one-shot accept/reject on APPLY, accepting Seeker_B secures a match albeit not top-tier; but strategic risk of losing E is moderate-to-high because Company_B highly prioritizes E. Therefore accept Seeker_B."
