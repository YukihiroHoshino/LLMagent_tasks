If you decide to formally apply, we aim to complete the remaining steps and make a decision within ~1–2 weeks depending on scheduling.\n\nTo make sure we’re aligned before you apply: what’s one project you’ve led end-to-end where you defined the metrics up front and shipped an iteration within ~8–10 weeks? What was the KPI and what changed after launch?",

Given the market is near the end and I prefer any listed company over unemployment, I should apply and emphasize quick commitment."
