That’ll help me map the role and 90-day plan to what you want and be transparent about fit.",

Seeker_B ranks us last, so they’re unlikely to apply unless other options fail; we should still engage, differentiate our role, and probe what would make them consider us. Since they sent [TALK], respond with [TALK] and try to move them toward applying while keeping flexibility to pursue A/C later."
