Your emphasis on ramping quickly, taking ownership, and proactive stakeholder communication aligns strongly with what we value at Company_D.\n\nWe’d like to move forward and extend an offer for the open role. If you’re able, please do share your short 30/60/90-day plan—especially what you’d target as the first measurable “win” in the first 4–6 weeks—so we can align on priorities and get you set up for a fast start.\n\nLooking forward to working together.",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is on our true priority list (3rd: D > A > C > E > B). With quota 1 and only Seeker_A and Seeker_C remaining unmatched, accepting Seeker_C now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk of losing them to another company in later rounds. Seeker_C also ranks Company_D 3rd, so they may accept us if we move quickly. We previously only talked with Seeker_A and rejected Seeker_E; no conflicts. Best move: accept and reinforce mutual fit and fast start."
