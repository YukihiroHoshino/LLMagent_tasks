If I reject now, I might later attract a higher-priority parent (A-D), but each of those parents ranks Nursery_E last and is likely to apply elsewhere first, making it uncertain they will ever reach me within 30 rounds. Given the low likelihood of receiving higher-priority applicants and the benefit of filling the seat with a committed first-choice applicant, accepting Parent_E is the safer strategy to ensure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."
