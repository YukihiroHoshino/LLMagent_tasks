Given your confirmed readiness to start immediately, flexibility on schedule, and ability to confirm same-day, we’re able to finalize the available seat with your family now.\n\nPlease reply to confirm acceptance, and we will send the enrollment paperwork and next-step details today (we’ll also reach out via phone/text at +1-555-0104). If immediate start next week is still your preference, we’ll proceed on that basis unless you tell us otherwise. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_D’s true priority is A > B > C > D > E, quota 1. Only Parent_D is currently applying to us in round 7. Parent_D ranks Nursery_D first, so acceptance would be secure and end our search. However, higher-priority parents (A/B/C) have not applied to Nursery_D; given their preference lists, they are likely pursuing other nurseries first and may never reach us. Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting a lower-priority but committed candidate. With multiple prior rejections, we have already waited several rounds; market is progressing and it’s prudent now to fill the seat. Therefore accept Parent_D."
