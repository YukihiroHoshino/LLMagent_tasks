In the current inbox we have Parent_D and Parent_E applying; between them, Parent_D is ranked higher on our priority list. We have quota 1 and no current match, and there is no indication Parent_A or Parent_B are applying to us this round.

With quota 1 and still unmatched in round 7, accepting E now would lock in the lowest-priority feasible match and foreclose the possibility of matching with any higher-priority parent (A–D) if they later become unmatched and apply. Given the market: Parent_A ranks E last; Parent_B ranks E 4th; Parent_C ranks E last; Parent_D ranks E last—so chances are limited but not zero, especially if B is rejected elsewhere. Since we prefer higher-priority parents and can remain unmatched rather than accept a lower-priority one, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Parent_E’s applications while staying available for potential higher-priority applicants."
