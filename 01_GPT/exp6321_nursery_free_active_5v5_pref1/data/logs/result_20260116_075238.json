Accepting Parent_C now would prevent matching with A or B if they apply later, which would be worse per our objective. With round 28 (still rounds remaining), the best strategy to maximize match quality is to continue holding the seat for A/B and reject C again, consistent with prior communication."

Given we prefer a higher-priority match and can leave the seat unfilled rather than accept a lower-priority parent, and we have maintained this policy throughout, we should reject Parent_C again and keep the place open for A/B.
