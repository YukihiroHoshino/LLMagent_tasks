Parent_A has not applied at all; Parent_B applied earlier and was rejected, and there is no current [APPLY] from A/B in the round-16 inbox. We previously committed to a rule: hold through round 15 for A/B, then consider Parent_C in round 16 and act promptly unless a higher-priority application arrives at the boundary. Given only Parent_C has applied now, accepting Parent_C secures a match and is consistent with our stated process; continuing to hold risks ending unmatched through later rounds with no guarantee A/B will apply. Therefore accept Parent_C."
