However, accepting E now would block any chance to match with a higher-priority parent if one becomes unmatched and applies later. Our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting someone not on the list (E is on the list but lowest). With rounds remaining (16/30), we can still wait to preserve the option value for A–D. Therefore reject this round, but clarify the specific condition under which we would offer to E (i.e., sufficiently late rounds with no higher-priority applicants, or immediately if a higher-priority applicant set is known to be matched/withdrawn—though we lack visibility)."

Although we have not received any applications from higher‑priority families (Parents A–D) so far, we must still keep the remaining seat available in line with our priority order because a higher‑priority application could still arrive in the remaining rounds.\n\nOn your question: yes, we are approaching the point where we may be able to begin moving down the priority list, but we are not yet at the stage where we can do so this round. Practically, we would only move to the next family in priority order in the final stretch if the seat remains open and we still have not received any A–D applications by then.\n\nIf you would like to remain immediately actionable should we reach that point, please feel free to submit an [APPLY] again in a later round.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority order A>B>C>D>E. Only Parent_E applied this round; no higher-priority parents have contacted us at any point. However, accepting E now would foreclose the possibility of matching with any of A–D if they apply in later rounds. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should continue to hold the seat for potential higher-priority late applications until the very late rounds. Round 24 is late but not final; with 6 rounds remaining, there is still some chance A–D become unmatched and apply. Therefore reject E again while signaling we may move down the list only in the final stretch if no A–D appear."

Given the game ends at Round 30, continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched if A–D never apply (and their preferences place Nursery_E last for A–D, making it unlikely they will apply unless all other options fail). Parent_E has persistently applied and will accept immediately. In the late stage (Round 25), accepting Parent_E now maximizes the chance of filling our seat with an acceptable parent rather than remaining empty; the probability of receiving a higher-priority applicant in the remaining rounds appears low."
