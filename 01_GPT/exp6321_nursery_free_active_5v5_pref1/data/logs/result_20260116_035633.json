Parent_C lists Nursery_C as first choice and is applying now, giving a high likelihood of immediate stable fill. Given no higher-priority applicants in this round and the risk of remaining unfilled if we wait, accept Parent_C."

However, accepting Parent_E now would lock the only quota and foreclose any chance—however small—of matching with a higher-priority parent in later rounds.

Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A’s first choice is Nursery_B (and Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A highest), so Parent_A will likely match elsewhere and never apply to me.
