Parent_E sent [TALK], so we should maintain engagement without committing, reiterate no confirmed opening, and keep them active on the list."

I have already applied multiple times and they have not offered a confirmed place, but they have kept me on an active expression-of-interest list and asked for same-day confirmation if anything opens.

However, we have no current match and no higher-priority parent is engaging with us; also, Parent_E is not applying, only talking. With quota 1 and no confirmed opening to offer, accepting is not possible; rejecting would unnecessarily burn the relationship and could reduce chances to fill if no higher-priority parent ever applies. Best strategy is to continue TALK, confirm they remain active, and restate there is no change in availability while keeping them warm as a fallback."

Given parents’ preferences, Parent_A strongly prefers B over E, Parent_B prefers A/C/B over E, Parent_C prefers C/B/A over E, Parent_D prefers D/A/C/B over E, and only Parent_E ranks Nursery_E first. Since we cannot proactively solicit in this protocol and there is no indication higher-priority parents will apply to Nursery_E soon, holding the seat risks ending unmatched.
