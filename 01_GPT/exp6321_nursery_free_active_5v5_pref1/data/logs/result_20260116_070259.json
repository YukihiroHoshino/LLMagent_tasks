Since the current message is [TALK], I should not accept/reject; I should keep Parent_E warm, indicate waitlist/reconsideration possibility, and request key info, while preserving flexibility to accept a higher-ranked applicant if one appears."

Given parents' preferences, Parent_A prefers B then A then C then D then E (E is last), Parent_B ranks E 4th, Parent_C ranks E last, Parent_D ranks E last; thus it is unlikely higher-priority parents will apply to Nursery_E soon. Previously rejecting Parent_E preserved optionality, but continuing to wait risks ending unmatched. With no competing applicants in inbox and Parent_E ready to enroll immediately, accepting secures a match now, which is better than remaining unfilled if higher-priority parents never come."
