Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd (after Nursery_A), and Parent_A ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after Nursery_B and Nursery_A). Given Parent_A will likely apply to Nursery_B first and Parent_B to Nursery_A first, there is some chance one of them later applies to Nursery_C if rejected elsewhere. But there is no guarantee they will reach us, and rejecting Parent_C risks ending up with a lower-priority parent (Parent_D/Parent_E) or remaining unmatched if dynamics shift.

The reason we haven’t been able to make an offer so far is that we must finalize places based on our allocation/priority order and the set of applicants engaging with us in each round, and we cannot pre-commit the remaining place outside that process.\n\nIf you’d like, you can send a brief note confirming (1) your earliest possible start date, (2) your preferred schedule pattern (e.g., full-time/part-time days), and (3) a same-day contact number/email for rapid confirmation. If an opening becomes available for you within the process, we will reach out immediately.\n\nThank you again for your patience, and please do continue pursuing your other listed options in parallel given the uncertainty.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E",

Parent_E has applied multiple times and I have consistently rejected; accepting now would lock my only seat and prevent me from matching with any higher-priority parent if they approach later. In this round Parent_E sent [TALK], not an application, so I should respond with [TALK]. I should avoid signaling an imminent offer and instead keep the door open only conditionally while encouraging them to pursue other options. There are no other messages in the inbox this round, but given my objective (maximize priority), I should continue to wait for higher-priority parents rather than commit to Parent_E."

Given all nurseries share the same priority order and most parents rank Nursery_E last (A-D) while Parent_E ranks Nursery_E first, the probability of receiving A/B/C/D may be low, but not impossible if they fail to secure preferred nurseries.
