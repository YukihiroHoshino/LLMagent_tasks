Given all nurseries share the same priority order, Parent_A and Parent_B are highly competitive and may be accepted elsewhere; but Nursery_A and Nursery_B will likely attract Parent_A/Parent_B first. Still, accepting Parent_C now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the chance to match with Parent_A or Parent_B if they later apply.

This preserves the chance to secure Nursery_C as my best remaining feasible option without triggering another automatic rejection this round."

We don’t have a fixed “guaranteed round” to finalize, but as the process approaches the final rounds and the pool of unmatched higher-priority families becomes clearer, our ability to make a final offer to the remaining applicant increases.\n\nIf you would like to remain in consideration, you’re welcome to continue checking in and/or submit an [APPLY] in a later round.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
