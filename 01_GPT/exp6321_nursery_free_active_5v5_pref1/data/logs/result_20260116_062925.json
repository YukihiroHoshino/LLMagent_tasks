              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority order is A > B > C > D > E, quota 1. Only Parent_E is applying to us this round, and we have repeatedly rejected them to preserve the option of matching with a higher-priority parent if they later become available. However, it is now round 27 (close to the end at round 30). Given all nurseries share identical priorities, higher-priority parents (A–D) are likely to be absorbed by their higher-ranked choices earlier, and none have approached Nursery_E so far. Holding out further risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting Parent_E (who is on our acceptable list). Therefore, accept Parent_E now to secure a match within quota."
