Given all nurseries share the same priority order (A>B>C>D>E) and parents’ preferences show A prefers B most, B prefers A most, C prefers C most, D prefers D most, and only E prefers Nursery_E first. This makes it unlikely that higher-priority parents will come to Nursery_E early, but not impossible (they may be rejected elsewhere and later apply). With 30 rounds available, it is better to keep the seat open for now and reject Parent_E, since we prefer matching higher on our list and can likely still fill later if needed."

If the seat can be offered to us at this point for any reason (e.g., higher-priority families have accepted elsewhere, declined, or are no longer proceeding), we will accept immediately and can complete all enrollment paperwork the same day. We are fully flexible on start date and schedule, and can also accommodate a very short-notice start if helpful.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority order A > B > C > D > E. Parent_E is the lowest-priority acceptable parent. No other parents contacted Nursery_E in round 30, but accepting Parent_E would forfeit any chance (however small) of matching with a higher-priority parent if they were to become unmatched and apply. Throughout the history, we have consistently communicated strict priority allocation and repeatedly rejected Parent_E’s applications. To remain consistent with our stated policy and to avoid taking our lowest-priority candidate while higher-priority candidates may still be in play elsewhere, we reject again in the final round."
