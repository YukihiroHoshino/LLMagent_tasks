For that reason, we are not able to issue a time-limited/conditional offer to a lower-priority applicant while we are still attempting to finalize in priority order.\n\nThat said, your readiness to start immediately, accept any attendance pattern, and complete documentation/payment same-day is noted. If we reach a point where we are able to move to your application in our priority order, we would be able to proceed quickly.\n\nIf you would like to remain in active consideration, please continue to submit a formal application in the next round ([APPLY]) confirming immediate acceptance.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Parent_E is last on our true priority list. Higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) could still approach us if they fail to secure their higher-ranked options. Parent_C has repeatedly applied and is higher priority than E, so if we were to move down the list we would accept C before E. Parent_E is currently only [TALK], so no accept/reject decision is required. Best strategy is to keep E warm without committing, avoid conditional offers that could block a higher-priority match, and invite them to continue applying while we finalize in priority order."

              "thought": "Nursery_C’s true priority ranks Parent_E last. However, by round 22 no higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) are currently applying to Nursery_C; only Parent_E is in the inbox. Parent_C previously applied repeatedly and was rejected, and Parents A/B/D prefer other nurseries and likely matched earlier. With quota 1 and the process late, holding out further risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting a listed (acceptable) parent. Parent_E has repeatedly confirmed immediate acceptance and full flexibility, reducing execution risk. Therefore accept Parent_E now to secure a match."
