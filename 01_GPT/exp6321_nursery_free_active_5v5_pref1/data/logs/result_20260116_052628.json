I’m fully flexible on start date and schedule, including a short-notice start.\n\nIf you are still comparing families this round, I would be grateful to be considered as the lowest-risk option for immediate fill.

With quota 1 and round 18 (still time remaining), it is strategically better to keep the seat available for a higher-priority parent rather than lock in Parent_D.
