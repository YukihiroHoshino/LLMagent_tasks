We are already in round 18, Nursery_E is the only unfilled nursery, and continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched (worse than accepting E, who is still on our acceptable list). With quota 1 and only Parent_E applying this round, the best achievable outcome now is to accept Parent_E and secure a match rather than gamble on a highly unlikely late application from A–D."
