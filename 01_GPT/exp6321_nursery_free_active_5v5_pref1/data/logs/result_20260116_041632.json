Given the full market info: Parent_A prefers B then A; Parent_B prefers A then C then B then E; Parent_C prefers C then B then A; Parent_D prefers D then A; Parent_E prefers E first. It is plausible that higher-priority parents (especially B, who ranks E 4th) could still end up applying to me if rejected elsewhere.

However, Parent_A/Parent_B/Parent_C are higher priorities and currently unmatched; given all nurseries share the same priority list, those parents may be accepted quickly by their top choices, but there is still a chance one of them later applies to Nursery_E (especially if rejected elsewhere). Accepting Parent_D now would lock our only spot and prevent matching with A/B/C if they approach later.
