If an opening arises, I can:\n- confirm acceptance within 1 hour of contact,\n- start immediately (including mid-week),\n- take any pattern (including 2–3 days/week) with no day exclusions (Mon–Fri), including a temporary/bridging arrangement,\n- return forms within 24 hours and pay any required deposit immediately.\n\nAll contact details and emergency/authorised pick-up information are already on file; please contact me via my primary email + phone (and then my backup contact if needed).\n\nThank you again for considering us if circumstances change.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_E remains unmatched in the final round, and it is my top true preference. Although prior applications were rejected due to priority/capacity, a last-minute opening is still possible. I will send a concise [APPLY] that reiterates immediate acceptance within 1 hour, immediate start, and full flexibility, while minimizing admin burden and referencing that all documents/details are already on file."

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority order A>B>C>D>E. Only Parent_E is in the inbox this final round; Parent_D previously applied and was rejected, and no higher-priority parents (A–D) are currently engaging with Nursery_E. Given this is round 30 (end of simulation), holding out for a higher-priority parent is no longer feasible. Parent_E is on our priority list (though lowest) and has repeatedly confirmed immediate acceptance and extreme flexibility, so accepting now secures a match rather than ending unmatched."
