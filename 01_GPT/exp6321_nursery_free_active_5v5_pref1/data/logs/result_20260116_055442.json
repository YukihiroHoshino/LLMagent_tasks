From preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 1st. This implies it is unlikely A, C, or D will apply to us unless rejected elsewhere; B might apply later if rejected by A/C/B choices; E is most likely but was already rejected. Given uncertainty and to avoid ending unmatched, accepting Parent_C now secures a match, though C is unlikely to prefer us and may only be here after rejections. Still, per rules, an [ACCEPT] finalizes match, and our objective is to match as high as possible within quota; with no better candidates in inbox and low probability of A/B applying soon, accept C rather than risk no match."
