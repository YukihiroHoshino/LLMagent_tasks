Given the environment allows waiting up to round 30 and leaving unfilled is preferable to taking someone outside the list (but C is on the list), the key tradeoff is risk: accept C now vs hold out for A/B. Parent_A prefers B then A then C then D; Parent_B prefers A then C then B then E then D. Both rank Nursery_D low, so they are unlikely to apply early, but could apply if rejected elsewhere. Still, accepting C now guarantees a relatively high-ranked match (3rd) and avoids ending unmatched. With no other applicants and no mechanism for tentative holds, the safer strategy to maximize expected outcome is to accept Parent_C now rather than gamble on A/B appearing later."
