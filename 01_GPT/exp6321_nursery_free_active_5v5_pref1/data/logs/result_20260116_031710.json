Higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) all rank Nursery_E last except Parent_B who ranks it 4th, so it is unlikely they will apply to me early (or at all) in this market. Given the risk of ending unmatched if I reject now and wait for higher-priority parents who probably will match elsewhere, it is optimal to accept Parent_E’s application and secure a match."

Accepting Parent_B now would secure a high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-priority parent if Parent_A never applies.

Only Parent_C contacted us this round, but Parent_A and Parent_B are higher-priority and may apply later (Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd; Parent_A ranks Nursery_C 3rd). Accepting Parent_C now would forgo the chance to match with A or B if they approach in future rounds. Since Parent_C is only [TALK] and we have repeatedly rejected their [APPLY] attempts, we should maintain waitlist communication without committing, preserving flexibility to accept a higher-priority parent if they apply. Provide clear guidance: no confirmed opening; ask them to keep us updated and optionally submit docs for readiness, but no promise."

Given the repeated rejections, continuing to reject risks ending the simulation unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply to Nursery_C (they may be pursuing their top choices elsewhere). Accepting Parent_C now secures a match with a parent who ranks within our priority list and is ready to confirm immediately."
