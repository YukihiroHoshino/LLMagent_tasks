This is the announced reassessment round (15), and Nursery_C has repeatedly said they would consider issuing an offer if no higher-priority [APPLY] materialized. To maximize my chance, I should submit a clear, ready-to-accept application now, restating flexibility and emphasizing that no higher-priority application is in hand per their recent updates, while respectfully acknowledging their priority policy."

As of now, we do **not** have any higher-priority applications in hand, and we are ready to move forward with filling our single available place. We are therefore pleased to **offer you the place at Nursery_C**.\n\nIf you would like to confirm, please reply acknowledging acceptance and we will immediately proceed with enrollment (ID, immunization/health records, emergency contacts, and any remaining forms). Your stated needs (full-day Monday–Friday, flexible start date, no known allergies) are noted.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. True priority list ranks Parent_E last, but no other parents have applied to Nursery_C in many rounds; Parent_C previously applied and was rejected, and Parent_A/Parent_B have never applied despite Nursery_C being their 3rd/2nd choice respectively. We stated we would reassess around round 15 and begin issuing an offer rather than hold indefinitely. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply. At round 15, with no higher-priority applications in hand, the optimal action to secure a match is to accept Parent_E now."
