              "thought": "As Nursery_C, my true priority order is A > B > C > D > E, with quota 1. Only Parent_E has applied this round; Parent_C previously applied and was rejected, and no higher-priority parents (A–D) have contacted me in many rounds. With the simulation at round 25 and nearing the end (round 30), the risk of ending unmatched is increasing. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match rather than leaving the seat vacant, and there is no evidence of imminent higher-priority applications. Therefore, I should accept Parent_E."
