However, Parent_A ranks Nursery_D 4th and is likely to apply to B then A then C before D; Parent_B ranks D last; Parent_C ranks D 4th; Parent_E ranks D last. Parent_D ranks Nursery_D 1st and applied immediately, making them the most likely secure match. Waiting risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never reach Nursery_D. Accepting Parent_D now ensures a filled seat with a committed parent, despite not being top priority."

Given the market preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last and is unlikely to apply; Parent_B and Parent_C also rank Nursery_E 4th/5th and are unlikely to apply early; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last. While there is some chance a higher-priority parent could apply later if rejected elsewhere, it is low. With quota 1 and a reliable first-choice applicant now, accepting secures a match rather than risking ending unfilled or with the same/lower outcome later."

Since all nurseries share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), waiting would only increase the risk that Parent_A or Parent_B apply first and take the spot.

Our true priority ranks Parent_A and Parent_B above Parent_C, so ideally we would like to hold the spot for A or B if they are likely to apply. However, in round 1 Parent_A is expected to apply to Nursery_B first, and Parent_B is expected to apply to Nursery_A first, so neither is likely to approach us immediately. Accepting Parent_C now secures a solid match with a parent who strongly prefers us, avoiding the risk of ending up unmatched or with a lower-priority parent later. Given quota 1 and no higher-ranked applicants in our inbox, accept."

In this round, only Parent_B has applied to us. If we reject, we risk ending unmatched if Parent_A never applies (Parent_A’s first choice is Nursery_B, and Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A highly, so Parent_A may get and accept Nursery_B). Accepting Parent_B now secures a high-ranked match within quota 1 and is likely stable since we are Parent_B’s top choice."
