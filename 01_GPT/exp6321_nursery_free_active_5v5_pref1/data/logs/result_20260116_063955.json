Since Nursery_D is Parent_D’s first choice, Parent_D is likely to remain interested, but the protocol requires an immediate accept/reject on [APPLY]; I cannot hold. Given full information, higher-priority parents are likely to pursue their top choices first (A->B, B->A, C->C, E->E), so they may not come to D, but there is still a chance (e.g., if rejected elsewhere).
