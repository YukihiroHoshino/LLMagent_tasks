As we are now in round 7, I wanted to check in briefly: have you received (or do you expect imminently) any formal applications from higher-priority families (Parent_A–Parent_D) for the remaining place?\n\nWe remain genuinely interested in Nursery_C, and if no higher-priority application is in hand, I am ready to submit a formal [APPLY] at the start of round 8 (or sooner if you advise) and to confirm acceptance immediately if offered.\n\nThank you again for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Since we are in round 7, I will send a [TALK] message to maintain interest and ask whether any higher-priority applications have arrived, while signaling I am ready to submit a formal [APPLY] immediately in round 8 if the situation remains unchanged."

That said, late applications can still occur, so we are continuing to hold the place for higher-priority families through the next round.\n\nIf you would like to be considered at the earliest point we can, please send a formal [APPLY] at the start of round 8.

However, by round 7 no higher-priority parents have applied to Nursery_C; Parent_C applied earlier and was rejected, and Parents A/B/D likely matched elsewhere given their preferences (A prefers B then A; B prefers A then C; D prefers D then A then C). Nursery_C is currently the only unmatched nursery, suggesting higher-priority parents may already be matched, making it unlikely they will apply later. Still, to maximize chance of a higher-priority match, keep spot open through round 8 as previously indicated, and invite Parent_E to apply in round 8 for immediate consideration if no higher-priority applications arrive."
