Although Parent_E is applying now and ranks me first, I should consider the wider market: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last. That makes it unlikely that higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) will apply to me soon, especially since each has higher-ranked options where all nurseries share the same priority ordering (favoring Parent_A most). However, Parent_B might eventually apply if rejected elsewhere, but that is uncertain. With quota 1 and only one applicant now, accepting Parent_E guarantees filling the seat, but risks missing a potential later application from Parent_B (or others) who are higher on my list. Given the strong likelihood I otherwise remain unmatched because I am low on most parents' preference lists, it is strategically better to accept Parent_E now rather than gamble on a higher-ranked applicant who is unlikely to come."

It is plausible they may apply in upcoming rounds if rejected elsewhere (A prefers B then A; B prefers A then C). Accepting Parent_C now would block the chance to match with A or B later. Given we can still reject and wait without penalty in this setting, the optimal strategy to maximize our match on the true priority list is to keep the seat available for Parent_A or Parent_B for now.

However, only Parent_C is currently engaging with Nursery_C and has demonstrated strong commitment and flexibility. Still, Parent_C has already applied multiple times and was rejected; accepting now without a confirmed opening would be inconsistent with prior stance and could create an unstable commitment. Since the parent’s current message is [TALK] and asks about likely release patterns, the best move is to continue dialogue, avoid committing, and preserve the option to accept a higher-priority parent if they approach later. Provide realistic information: we cannot forecast specific days; if anything, partial-week Tue/Thu or 3-day patterns are most common but not predictable. Reiterate we will contact immediately upon confirmation and invite them to keep alternatives."
