So the only parent likely to apply to Nursery_E early is Parent_E (already rejected) and possibly others later if rejected elsewhere. However, in this market, each nursery shares the same priority list, so A/B/C will be highly sought and likely matched to top choices elsewhere, making it plausible that higher-priority parents (A/B/C) will never come to Nursery_E. Still, accepting Parent_D now would lock in a low-priority match and forgo any chance (however small) of later receiving Parent_A/B/C.

Parent_E ranks Nursery_E first and has been persistent, but is lowest on our priority list. Given we have an open quota of 1 and no higher-priority candidates in the inbox (and low likelihood of A–C approaching soon), accepting Parent_D now secures a better match than holding out and potentially ending with Parent_E or remaining unmatched. Therefore accept Parent_D."

Parent_D has applied multiple times and is ranked above Parent_E, but has already been rejected to keep the seat for even higher-priority families; accepting Parent_E would be inconsistent with that strategy and would yield the worst possible match on our list.
