However, Parent_A ranks Nursery_A as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_B) and Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A highest, so Parent_A is likely to apply to Nursery_B first and could be accepted there, making them unavailable later. Parent_C prefers Nursery_C first; Parent_D prefers Nursery_D first; Parent_E prefers Nursery_E first—so none are likely to approach Nursery_A early. Parent_B ranks Nursery_A as first choice and has applied, presenting a high likelihood of securing a strong match now. Waiting risks ending unmatched or getting a lower-priority parent later; accepting Parent_B yields the #2 choice on our list with high certainty."

With equal capacities and nurseries sharing the same priority order (Parent_A highest to Parent_E lowest), I should apply immediately to my first choice before it fills with a higher-priority parent. A clear, committed application may help if the nursery has any discretion in tie-breaking or engagement, but the main goal is to secure my top option as early as possible."

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority ranks Parent_E last. Parent_E is applying now and lists Nursery_E as their first choice, so accepting would secure a match immediately. However, higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) all rank Nursery_E last in their preferences, so it is unlikely they will apply to Nursery_E in early rounds (or at all unless rejected elsewhere). Given this, holding out for a higher-priority parent has low expected value and risks ending unmatched. Therefore, accept Parent_E now to fill the seat."

However, on Nursery_C’s true priority list, Parent_C is ranked 3rd behind Parent_A and Parent_B. Given Parent_A prefers Nursery_B first (and Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A highly), Parent_A is likely to match elsewhere quickly. Parent_B ranks Nursery_A first and Nursery_C second; they may apply to Nursery_A first and could be accepted there. There is no current application from Parent_A or Parent_B in the inbox, and holding out risks ending up unmatched if higher-priority parents secure other spots. With quota 1 and a credible immediate commitment from Parent_C, accepting is a safe way to fill the seat with a still-high priority candidate."

While Parent_D ranks below A/B/C, there is a significant chance higher-priority parents will not apply to Nursery_D because it is not their top choice (A prefers B; B prefers A; C prefers C/B/A). Parent_D lists Nursery_D as their first choice and is ready to commit immediately, which reduces the risk of ending unmatched. With no competing applications this round and no ability to hold a waitlist under the rules, accepting now secures a match and is preferable to rejecting and risking an unfilled seat."
