Although Parent_E is eager and repeatedly applies, accepting now would forfeit any chance to match with higher-priority parents (Parent_A–Parent_D) should they engage before the market ends. With quota 1 still open and no other applicants this round, the best strategy to maximize priority is to continue holding the seat rather than locking in the lowest-priority parent."

Parent_E is actively applying and can confirm immediately. Given the late stage and persistent lack of higher-priority engagement, accepting Parent_E now is better than risking ending unmatched by holding the seat indefinitely."
