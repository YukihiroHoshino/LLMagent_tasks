It is plausible that higher-priority parents (A–D) will apply to their top nurseries and may get accepted there, but there is also a chance some of them later apply to Nursery_E if rejected elsewhere. With quota 1, accepting Parent_E now would lock in the lowest-ranked option and forgo any chance at a higher-ranked match. Since there is no penalty stated for waiting and the process allows continued negotiation up to 30 rounds, the best strategy to maximize match quality is to reject now and hold the seat for potential higher-ranked parents."

Still, if they are rejected by their top choices, Nursery_D could become a fallback (it is 4th for A/B/C). Parent_D, by contrast, ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice, so accepting now would secure a match but may block a later higher-priority parent.
