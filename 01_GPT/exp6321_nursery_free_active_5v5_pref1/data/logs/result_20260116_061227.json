Given parents' preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 1st. This suggests Parent_A is unlikely to apply; Parent_B might apply later if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Parent_C now could block a potential higher-priority Parent_B later. With only round 2 and no competing higher-priority applicants in the inbox, optimal strategy is to reject Parent_C to preserve capacity for Parent_B (and theoretically Parent_A), since leaving unfilled is better than matching low in the list relative to possible future applicants."
