Parent_C is highly interested (first choice) but I have repeatedly rejected while waiting for higher-priority candidates to conclude. In this round, only Parent_C applied to me; however, accepting now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_A or Parent_B if they approach later, which would be strictly better per my priority list. With round 17 and no confirmed availability change, the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Parent_C and keep the seat for higher-priority parents, while giving a clearer timing expectation consistent with prior messages (1–2 rounds)."
