That reduces the chance I will receive higher-priority applications immediately. Since Parent_C ranks me first, accepting now secures a match with a relatively high-priority parent and avoids the risk of ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply.

              "thought": "Nursery_A’s true priority order is A > B > C > D > E. We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so we should only accept if we believe no higher-priority parent is likely to apply later; however, with full information, Parent_A ranks Nursery_A as 2nd, Parent_B ranks Nursery_A as 1st (but previously applied and was rejected), Parent_C ranks Nursery_A as 3rd, and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A as 2nd. Since accepting Parent_E (lowest priority) would block us from matching with any higher-priority parent should they apply in later rounds, and there is still ample time (round 15/30), the optimal strategy to maximize our match is to continue holding the seat for a higher-priority parent. Parent_E has applied many times and we have consistently rejected based on priority order; nothing has changed in our priorities or capacity. Therefore, reject again this round."

Although E is lowest priority, leaving the seat unfilled is worse than accepting someone on the list, and no higher-priority applicants are currently requesting the spot. Given repeated rejections were strategic to wait for higher-priority parents, but by round 16 with no such applicants appearing, accepting Parent_E secures a filled seat rather than risking continued vacancy through round 30."
