We can only make an offer when we are able to finalize the allocation in line with our priority order and any required eligibility/fit checks. At times this means a place can remain unconfirmed while we determine whether a higher‑priority application will proceed (e.g., pending a response/confirmation) or whether we are able to move to the next family.\n\nThere is not a fixed public deadline after which we automatically offer the place to lower‑priority families, and your flexibility on start pattern (which is helpful) does not override the priority order.\n\nPractically, the condition under which we could offer you a place is: if we reach a point where no higher‑priority family is able to take the place (or none comes forward in a way that allows us to finalize), and we are then able to allocate down the list.\n\nYour details remain on file as fully flexible and ready to start immediately.

However, the nursery also prefers leaving the position unfilled rather than accepting a parent not on the list; Parent_E is on the list, so acceptance is permissible. Still, accepting Parent_E conflicts with the repeated allocation-priority constraint narrative and would be a lowest-priority outcome. With no higher-priority applicants present and the cycle ending, the choice is between (i) accepting the lowest-priority listed parent or (ii) leaving unfilled. The objective emphasizes highest possible on the list; but since none higher are available now, accepting Parent_E is the best achievable match among feasible matches this round.
