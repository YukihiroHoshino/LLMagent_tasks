              "thought": "Nursery_A’s true priority is A > B > C > D > E, quota 1. Parent_E is the lowest-priority acceptable parent. Although Parent_E is highly committed and repeatedly reapplies, accepting now would lock in the worst feasible match while there remains a possibility (even late) that a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_A, who is top priority and not yet matched) could apply before the end (round 30). Since we prefer a higher-ranked parent and have been consistently holding the spot pending higher-priority outreach, and quota is still open, the best strategy to maximize outcome is to continue rejecting Parent_E’s application while keeping them as a backup if higher-priority options definitively fail—however, with only one round left, we still cannot improve by accepting E prematurely given our stated process. Therefore: reject, reiterate pending status and that we will contact if we reach them in sequence."

Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is the only applicant in the final round inbox. However, accepting E would lock in our lowest-priority parent and foreclose any chance (however small) of matching with a higher-priority parent (A–D). Given our objective to match as high as possible on our true priority list and our consistent prior stance of holding the spot for higher-priority families, we should continue to reject E rather than accept a lowest-priority match at the end. Leaving the seat unfilled is preferable to deviating from the priority objective."
