Given the market rules, I should only accept Parent_E if it is impossible/unlikely to receive any higher-priority applicant before the end; however, there is still time remaining (round 28 of 30) and no new information guaranteeing higher-priority parents are unavailable. Consistent with prior rounds and my objective to match as high as possible on my priority list, I should reject Parent_E again this round."
