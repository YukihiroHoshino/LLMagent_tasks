However, waiting preserves the possibility (however small) of receiving a higher-priority applicant later, and accepting now would lock in the lowest-priority match.

Therefore, the probability that Parent_A/B/C will later apply to me is low.

So only Parent_B has any realistic chance to come to us, but even Parent_B prefers A and C and B over E. With only one round left (round 29 now, round 30 final), the probability of getting a higher-priority parent is low, but not zero. However, if we reject again and no higher-priority parent comes by round 30, we risk ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is still on our acceptable list). Since our objective is to match with as high as possible within quota, and the time horizon is almost over, the optimal move is to accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than gamble on a very unlikely higher-priority late application."
