However, Nursery_D’s true priority ranks Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_C above Parent_D. Given the full preference lists, Parent_A/B/C all rank Nursery_D as 4th choice, so they are unlikely to apply here in early rounds but could if rejected elsewhere. With quota 1, accepting Parent_D now forecloses the possibility (however uncertain) of matching with a higher-priority parent later. Since we can only respond with ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, the strategic choice is to reject now to preserve the slot for higher-priority candidates."

However, Parent_A is my top priority and also ranks Nursery_B as first and Nursery_A as second; Parent_A may apply to Nursery_B first, but could later apply to me if rejected there. Waiting could risk ending unmatched or accepting a lower-priority parent later, but accepting Parent_B now forecloses the chance to match with Parent_A. Given the mechanism (parents choose one nursery per round) and no guarantee Parent_A will ever apply to me, the best expected outcome is to accept a high-priority, committed applicant now."

Parent_C likely goes to Nursery_C (top choice). Parent_D likely goes to Nursery_D (top choice). Parent_E uniquely ranks Nursery_E first, making them the most likely applicant I will actually receive.
