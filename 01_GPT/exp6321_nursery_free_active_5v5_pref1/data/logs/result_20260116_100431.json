Given all nurseries share the same priority order, higher-ranked parents (especially Parent_A) are likely to be accepted quickly by their top choices (e.g., Nursery_B for Parent_A), but there is still a meaningful chance that one of Parent_A/Parent_B/Parent_C could later apply to Nursery_D if rejected elsewhere. With quota 1, accepting Parent_D now sacrifices the option value of waiting for a higher-priority parent. Since only Parent_D has applied to Nursery_D this round and we are early (round 1 of 30), it is strategically better to reject and keep capacity for higher-priority candidates."
