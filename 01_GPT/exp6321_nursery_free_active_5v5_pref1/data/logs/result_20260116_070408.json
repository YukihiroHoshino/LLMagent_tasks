Under our true priority list, Parent_E is lowest, but accepting them is better than remaining unmatched given no higher-priority parents are currently engaging us and the process is late (round 24). Parent_E has repeatedly confirmed immediate acceptance and fast paperwork/payment, reducing risk. Therefore accept to secure a match now."
