Additionally, Seeker_C (our top choice) is unlikely to apply to us early because they rank Company_C 4th, so the best attainable improvement over Seeker_D would be Seeker_B or Seeker_C later, but we already have a higher-ranked applicant than Seeker_E in-hand.

Given we can leave the position unfilled rather than hire outside the list, but Seeker_A is on the list, the key question is whether we expect a realistic chance at Seeker_B/Seeker_D. Seeker_B ranks Company_A 3rd (after Company_B, Company_D), so they may not come to us early. Seeker_D ranks Company_A 2nd (after Company_C), so if Company_C doesn’t take them, they may apply to us soon.
