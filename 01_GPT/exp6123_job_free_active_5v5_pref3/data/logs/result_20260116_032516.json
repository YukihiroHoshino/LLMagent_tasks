Given Seeker_B’s strong preference for us (they rank Company_B #1), we can reject now and potentially still attract them later if top choices don’t materialize, but rejection risks losing them to Company_D/Company_A quickly. Still, to maximize chance of landing Seeker_D or Seeker_A, we should not fill the role immediately with a lower-ranked candidate."

In round 1, no higher-priority seekers (Seeker_D or Seeker_E) have contacted Company_D, and their preferences indicate they are more likely to pursue Company_C/Company_A/Company_B before Company_D (Seeker_D has Company_D last; Seeker_E has Company_D 4th). Waiting risks losing Seeker_C to another company and ending up unmatched or with a lower-ranked candidate later.
