Given we have full information: Seeker_B ranks Company_A #3 and may first pursue Company_B (#1) and Company_D (#2); Company_B prioritizes Seeker_D then Seeker_A then Seeker_B, so Seeker_B may not secure Company_B. Seeker_D ranks Company_A #2 but will likely pursue Company_C (#1) first; Company_C ranks Seeker_D #3, so Seeker_D could plausibly match there.

Per your request, here’s a concise “metrics plan” example (outline):\n\nMETRICS PLAN (example)\n- Baseline window: prior 4 full weeks pre-launch; exclude holidays/known anomalies; freeze definition before build.\n- Primary metric: median end-to-end cycle time (intake timestamp → “complete/fulfilled” timestamp).\n- Guardrails (2–3): (1) defect/rework rate (% items requiring reroute/missing fields), (2) incident rate/SEV count on the workflow, (3) customer contacts/CSAT for the affected flow.\n- Instrumentation: event + state transition mapping validated with Eng/Data; data quality checks (missing events, timestamp drift) logged.\n- Dashboard ownership: Data Analyst owns pipeline + dashboard; I own metric definitions, interpretation, and decision readouts; Eng owns logging fixes.\n- Review cadence: weekly metric review during build; daily/48-hr checkpoints during ramp; weekly for 4 weeks post-100% rollout.\n- Attribution/confounders: segment by cohort/channel/team; track volume mix; note concurrent policy/process changes; use staged rollout (10/25/50/100%) to compare exposed vs not-yet-exposed cohorts; if feasible, difference-in-differences on key segments.\n- Decision rule: proceed/hold/rollback if primary improves while guardrails stay within thresholds; document in decision log with rationale.\n\nIf you pivot and want to route interviewers, I’m happy to go deeper on metric definition tradeoffs (median vs p90, quality proxies, guardrail thresholds) in the screen. Email coordination remains best.",

In this round, only Seeker_E messaged with [TALK] asking whether the unmatched status is administrative. Since there is no [APPLY], no accept/reject decision is required. Best action is to confirm 'yes' (administrative artifact), close the loop, and direct them to apply to any future new req. Although Seeker_E is on our true priority list (last), we still cannot hire without an open slot."
