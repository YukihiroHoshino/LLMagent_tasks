I’ll proactively pre-brief decision-makers before meetings to shorten cycle time.\n\n3) Measuring impact in month 1: Define 2–3 leading indicators + 1 outcome metric (e.g., cycle time reduction, throughput/defect rate, on-time milestone hit rate, or cost/time saved).

Baseline by reviewing recent delivery plans/status updates and tagging blocks in a lightweight blocker log for new work starting week 1.\n\n2) Day ~14 increment I’d aim to ship\nA concrete increment would be a “Definition of Ready/Done + Acceptance Criteria template” enforced at the key handoff(s), plus a single shared intake board that makes readiness explicit. Practically: implement a required AC checklist in the ticket template, add a “Ready for Next Team” gate with named owner + timestamp, and pilot it on 5–10 live items across the three groups. The shipped outcome by ~day 14: fewer bounces due to unclear AC and a measurable reduction in queue time at the first major handoff.\n\n3) Handling a dependency owner repeatedly missing dates\n- First, make it visible and objective: agree on the dependency deliverable’s DoD, capture the commitment date in the shared tracker, and review weekly in the cross-team cadence.\n- Second, diagnose and fix the cause: 15-minute 1:1 to understand capacity/priority conflicts; propose a smaller slice, clearer AC, or earlier intermediate checkpoint; offer to remove blockers.\n- Third, add a reliability mechanism if misses continue: set an escalation path (their manager / steering owner) with a clear “if missed twice, escalate” rule, and create a fallback plan (alternative owner, parallel path, or scope adjustment) so the pipeline doesn’t stall.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share a one-page draft of the “handoff contract” (timestamps, readiness criteria, owners, escalation rule) that I’d use to standardize the three-group interface.

Crisp answers below.\n\n1) Tooling/automation (minimum viable workflow)\n- Non-negotiables in week 1 (manual if needed):\n  a) A single “Stage” field (G1 / H1 Queue / G2 / H2 Queue / G3 / H3 Queue / Done)\n  b) A “Stage Owner” field (who is accountable right now)\n  c) A “Blocked?” flag + Blocker Owner + Blocker Reason\n  d) A required Acceptance Criteria section before leaving G1\n- Timestamps: if we can’t auto-capture immediately, I’d start with just 4 manual timestamps captured via a simple checklist on transition (or even a Google Sheet roll-up): Ready_for_H1_at, H1_Accepted_at, Ready_for_H2_at, H2_Accepted_at. That’s enough to quantify the biggest queue-time issues fast.\n- Defer to week 2–4: full set of timestamps for all stages, automated workflow transition timestamps, and deeper integrations (PR links, deploy signals). The goal is to avoid “instrumentation paralysis” while still getting credible queue-time + blocker data.\n\n2) Governance (who is pipeline DRI + avoiding noisy escalation)\n- Pipeline DRI: I’d recommend a single accountable owner for 6–8 weeks (typically a program/ops PM or an eng lead with cross-team authority), with a named delegate in each of the 3 groups. Rotating DRIs can work later, but early on consistency matters while definitions and habits form.\n- Preventing noise:\n  a) Escalation triggers only on objective thresholds (e.g., 2 misses/30 days OR >2 business days downstream block) AND only after a quick “cause check” with the dependency owner.\n  b) Escalations are time-boxed and action-oriented: include the recovery proposal (re-scope/re-assign/intermediate milestone) so it’s not just reporting.\n  c) Use a “top blockers” lens: we escalate the few items causing the most aggregate blocked days, not every slip.\n\n3) First-week deliverable (day-5 output)\nBy end of day 5 I’d aim to deliver:\n- Baseline report (1–2 pages): last 4–6 weeks median + P75 end-to-end cycle time and (at minimum) H1/H2 queue-time estimates; top 3 stall points with evidence.\n- Working definitions: agreed DoR/DoD for each handoff (v1) + the minimum required fields/checklists embedded in the ticket template.\n- Operating cadence artifacts: kickoff notes (owners, SLAs, escalation path), a simple blocker log, and the weekly 5-minute readout template.\n- Dashboard draft: even if it’s a lightweight spreadsheet + screenshot from the ticket system at first, showing WIP by stage, aging items, and queue-time approximations.\n- A prioritized 2-week experiment plan: the specific “day ~14 increment” (e.g., enforced AC + readiness gate pilot on 5–10 items) with success criteria.\n\nIf this matches your constraints, I’m very interested in moving to the formal next step. If you’d like, tell me what tools you’re on (Jira/Linear/etc.) and the three group functions, and I’ll translate the minimum workflow into your exact fields/workflow states.\n\n[TALK]",

An ops/PM DRI is best positioned to maintain neutral governance, keep the system honest with metrics, and ensure follow-through without being pulled into one team’s local priorities.
