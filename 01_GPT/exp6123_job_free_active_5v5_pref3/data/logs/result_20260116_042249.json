I’m sharing these to understand which *types* of roles at Company_A they map to best for a future cycle (not to reopen the current role).\n\n1) Incident/ops domain (reliability + execution): Context: recurring operational incidents causing missed SLAs and noisy escalations. Ownership/scope: owned intake/triage process, set up weekly incident review cadence, defined KPIs and runbooks, coordinated fixes across 4 teams. Outcome: reduced repeat incidents ~30–40% over 8 weeks and improved on-time SLA performance.\n\n2) Program delivery domain (cross-functional execution): Context: ambiguous initiative with multiple stakeholders and unclear requirements. Ownership/scope: defined scope/milestones, created decision log, ran weekly stakeholder cadence, unblocked dependencies, managed risks to delivery. Outcome: launched by target date and improved adoption/throughput (measured via agreed KPI) within the first month.\n\n3) Process/backlog domain (operational efficiency): Context: large, messy backlog with unclear prioritization and long cycle times. Ownership/scope: implemented lightweight prioritization framework, cleaned taxonomy, introduced WIP limits and reporting, trained team on the new workflow. Outcome: improved cycle time and predictability (e.g., higher % of work completed within SLA) over the next quarter.\n\nTwo quick questions:\n- Based on these, which role families at Company_A would you expect to be the closest fit (e.g., ops/program, domain-specific execution, etc.), and are there particular domains I should target where “directly comparable reps” are most critical?\n- When I do see a clearly aligned posting, is the best path simply applying early via the careers page, or is there a specific recruiter/channel you recommend for ensuring the domain-specific examples are reviewed?\n\nAppreciate any directional guidance you can share.",
