Seeker_D is persistent and ready to close, but our stated process was to only request APPLY if we decide to proceed; right now D sent [TALK], so we can continue holding without committing. Given we prefer leaving unfilled over hiring outside list (D is inside list but lowest), and no better options are in inbox, the optimal move is to continue TALK and avoid triggering fast path unless we decide we are done waiting.
