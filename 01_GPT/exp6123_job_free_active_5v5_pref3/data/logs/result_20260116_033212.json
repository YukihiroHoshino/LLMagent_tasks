Decision recorded immediately in RAID as D-## with a 24-hr confirmation SLA.\n- Artifacts + enforcement: Updated sprint plan + dependency map, logged the scope change in RAID, and sent a same-day stakeholder note to QA/Support/Marketing with the new MVP definition + what moved to next sprint.\n- Escalation path used: When one team pushed back on de-scope, I escalated to the PO with explicit impact (“approve A today or launch slips ~1 week”); PO reaffirmed A and I documented the closure in the weekly exec update.\n- Before/after metrics: On-time sprint delivery improved from ~62% (prior 4 sprints avg) → ~85% (next 2 sprints); cycle time for the affected workstream reduced ~20% (less WIP/thrash); launch date held (no slip) and post-launch defects stayed flat vs. prior release.\n\nConfirmed for tomorrow 9:30–9:50am (local time).",

Here’s how I’d handle the scenario (P0 takes 2 eng-days mid-sprint; stakeholder insists keep full scope + hold date):\n\n(a) Exact options I’d present (quantified, decision-ready)\n- Option A — Protect date (recommended): Keep launch date; remove/shift ~2 eng-days of lowest-dependency scope from this sprint; keep quality bar/DoD unchanged.\n- Option B — Protect scope: Keep full scope; launch slips by ~2 eng-days (+ buffer for QA/retest), with an updated comms plan and downstream re-baseline.\n- Option C — Protect date + scope by trading quality/risk (explicitly): Keep date and scope only by accepting a defined risk (e.g., reduced non-critical test coverage OR temporary manual workaround) with named owner, monitoring, and a post-launch remediation SLA. This requires exec sign-off because it increases operational/defect risk.\n\n(b) What I’d de-scope first (1–2 concrete examples)\n- De-scope/shift items with low external dependency and low “gating” value:\n  1) UI polish / non-critical UX improvements (copy/layout, minor workflow optimizations).\n  2) Nice-to-have reporting/analytics (dashboards, additional breakdowns) that can ship safely post-launch.\n- If still needed: move non-critical edge-case handling where there is a documented workaround and it’s not compliance/security-related.\n\n(c) How I’d document/enforce within 24 hours\n- Within 2 hours: re-validate capacity vs. critical path with Eng lead; update the sprint plan and dependency map; draft a 1-page impact summary (A/B/C, timeline, risk, downstream impacts).\n- Same day decision huddle (10–15 min): PO + Eng lead as decision owners; stakeholder invited for input; exec sponsor only if stakeholder refuses tradeoffs.\n- Immediately after decision: log as RAID Decision (D-##) with owner + deadline, update the MVP checklist (Includes/Excludes + DoD unchanged unless Option C), and relabel moved items as Post-MVP with target sprint.\n- Enforcement: “swap-only” rule for the remainder of sprint; daily 10-min checkpoint; WIP limits; any new ask must specify what is removed and be approved by PO+Eng lead.\n- Comms: same-day stakeholder note to QA/Support/Marketing with the locked MVP scope + what moved + any risk accepted.\n\nI’ll walk this live tomorrow and can tailor the de-scope examples to your current workstream if you share what’s most at risk. \n\nBest,\nSeeker_E",

Answering the two clarifiers:\n\n1) Phased rollout — concrete rollback triggers + kill-switch authority\n- Rollback triggers I’ve used (set before ramp, reviewed with Eng/PM):\n  - Error rate: if 5xx (or request failure) exceeds baseline by >0.5–1.0pp for 10–15 minutes, or any sustained spike >2x baseline.\n  - Latency: p95 latency >20–30% above baseline for 10–15 minutes on the critical endpoints.\n  - Funnel/functional success: critical journey success rate drops >2–3pp vs. control/baseline (e.g., create→confirm completion), or retries/timeouts exceed an agreed threshold.\n  - “Hard stop” triggers: any P0 data integrity issue, security/compliance concern, or repeated bad states (e.g., duplicate writes) → immediate kill switch.\n- Final authority: I set this explicitly up front. In practice, the Eng on-call/Tech Lead owns the kill switch execution (fastest path), with the Product Owner as the business decision owner. For any P0 trigger, Eng Lead/on-call pulls immediately and informs PO/sponsor; no committee.\n\n2) Manual workaround — quantifying/limiting ops burden so it doesn’t become an indefinite tax\n- Volume cap + eligibility: define a maximum allowable manual cases/day (e.g., <=10/day) and a strict eligibility rule (only specific cohort/segment). If we exceed the cap for 2 consecutive days, we either (a) pause rollout/expand automation work, or (b) de-scope further.\n- Time-box + sunset: set an explicit sunset date (e.g., 2 weeks or by end of next sprint) with a committed automation/remediation ticket and named owner; tracked in weekly exec update until removed.\n- Staffing plan: assign a named ops owner + backup, estimate minutes/case, and confirm capacity (e.g., 10 cases/day * 8 min = ~80 min/day). If it threatens core ops throughput, we trigger the same decision framework (pause/ramp down/de-scope).\n\nConfirmed for tomorrow 9:30–9:50am (local time).
