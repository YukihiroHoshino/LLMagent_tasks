We’d be excited to move forward with you—welcome to Company_E. Please confirm you’re ready to proceed, and we’ll coordinate next steps right away.",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #2 on Company_E’s true priority list (only behind Seeker_A). We have quota 1 and no current match. Seeker_C has applied directly and signals readiness to commit. Given the round is already 4 and there is no guarantee Seeker_A will apply to us (Seeker_A ranks Company_E last), holding out risks ending unmatched. Accepting Seeker_C secures a very high-priority candidate immediately."
