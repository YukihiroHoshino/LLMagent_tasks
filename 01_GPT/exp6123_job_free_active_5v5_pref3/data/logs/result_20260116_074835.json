However, accepting Seeker_D now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority Seeker_C or Seeker_B later. Given seekers’ preferences: Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), Seeker_B ranks Company_C last (unlikely), while Seeker_D ranks Company_C 1st (strong commitment) and Seeker_E ranks Company_C 1st as well. Company_C has quota 1, so must balance certainty vs waiting for higher-ranked but unlikely candidates. Since Seeker_C and Seeker_B are unlikely to come to Company_C early (or at all), taking a top-choice candidate who is still reasonably high on our list (3rd) is a strong outcome and avoids ending unmatched.
