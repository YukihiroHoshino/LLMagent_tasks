In round 1, only Seeker_C has applied to us, but accepting now would use our only quota and prevent us from matching with higher-priority candidates who may still approach us (especially Seeker_D, though they currently rank Company_D last; Seeker_E ranks us 4th). Given the early round and the possibility to hold out for a higher-priority match, the optimal strategy is to reject Seeker_C now rather than lock in a lower-ranked hire."

In round 1, there is no guarantee Seeker_D or Seeker_A will apply to Company_B; Seeker_D prefers Company_C then Company_A then Company_B, and Seeker_A ranks Company_B 4th.

Between them, Seeker_D is ranked higher than Seeker_E, so accepting Seeker_D is preferable if we intend to fill now. However, there is a meaningful chance higher-priority candidates (Seeker_C or Seeker_B) may become available: Seeker_C prefers Company_D then A/B before C, and Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, so they are unlikely to apply early, but could later if rejected elsewhere. Also, Seeker_D has Company_C as #1 and would likely accept immediately; delaying risks losing them to another company, while accepting now locks the quota and prevents upgrading. Given Seeker_D is still a high (3rd) choice and is strongly committed to Company_C, the safer strategy to secure a solid match within quota is to accept Seeker_D now rather than gamble on low-probability availability of Seeker_C/Seeker_B."
