Given the market preferences, Seeker_D strongly prefers Company_C and Company_A over us and may never apply; Seeker_E also prefers Company_C/B/A over us, so they may not apply either.

Seeker_D (my top choice) has not applied to me and ranks Company_B third, behind Company_C and Company_A, so it’s unlikely I can attract D soon, especially since Company_D and Company_C also prioritize D highly. In this round I have applications from Seeker_A (my #2) and Seeker_C (my #4). I previously rejected Seeker_B (#3) and Seeker_E (#5). Seeker_A ranks me 4th, but is explicitly ready to commit immediately if accepted; accepting now secures a high-priority candidate and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for Seeker_D. Therefore, accept Seeker_A now and fill the quota."
