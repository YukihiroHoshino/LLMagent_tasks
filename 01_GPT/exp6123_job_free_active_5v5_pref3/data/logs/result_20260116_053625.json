I set success metrics, wrote the PRD, aligned stakeholders on tradeoffs, ran weekly exec readouts, and drove delivery to GA. Outcome: improved cycle time ~25% and reduced rework ~15% within the first quarter post-launch.\n\n(2) Prioritization + measurable outcomes: Took over a backlog with unclear ROI; built a scoring model (impact/effort/risk), reset roadmap, and negotiated scope with Sales/Support/Eng. Outcome: shipped top 4 initiatives in 8 weeks; increased adoption of the primary feature set ~20% and cut highest-volume support tickets ~30%.\n\n(3) Operational ownership + reliability: Led an initiative to harden a critical process with recurring incidents. I owned the incident review loop, implemented instrumentation/alerts, and coordinated fixes across teams. Outcome: reduced incident frequency ~40% and improved SLA compliance from ~92% to ~98% over 2 months.\n\n30/60/90 (tailored to an urgent deliverable: “own a key scope end-to-end and deliver measurable outcomes quickly”):\n• 30 days: Align on the exact success metric(s) and decision-makers; audit current state (data, user feedback, tech constraints); produce a crisp strategy + options doc with tradeoffs; lock an execution plan and milestone cadence.\n• 60 days: Deliver MVP/Phase 1 with instrumentation; run stakeholder reviews; iterate based on data; remove cross-functional blockers; publish weekly progress against metrics.\n• 90 days: Ship Phase 2/scale; formalize the operating rhythm (roadmap, KPI dashboard, incident/quality loop if relevant); document learnings and propose the next 2-quarter strategy with clear ROI.\n\nIf helpful, I can also send a 1-page writeup for any one of the projects above with deeper stakeholder map, risks, and artifacts.
