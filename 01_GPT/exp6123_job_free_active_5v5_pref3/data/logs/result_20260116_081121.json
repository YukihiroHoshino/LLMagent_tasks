Seeker_A ranks us #4, less likely but still possible. With only round 1 and quota 1, it is strategically better to wait rather than lock in a lower-priority candidate immediately.

Seeker_C’s top choice is Company_D (then A, B, then C), so landing Seeker_C is unlikely unless D/A/B reject them. Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, so they are very unlikely to apply here unless they are rejected broadly. Meanwhile, Seeker_D has Company_C as their #1 choice, so accepting secures a relatively high-priority candidate immediately and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked option or no match.

Result: delivered on schedule and reduced cycle time by ~20% versus the prior baseline by tightening handoffs and clarifying ownership.\n- In another project, I owned the rollout plan and cutover readiness (requirements, acceptance criteria, launch checklist). Result: smooth launch with no critical post-release issues and faster stakeholder sign-off due to clearer scoping and validation upfront.\n\n2) Cross-functional communication / clear updates + decisions:\n- I ran weekly stakeholder syncs and maintained a single source of truth (status, risks, decisions, next steps). Result: fewer escalations and faster decisions (typically within 24–48 hours) because tradeoffs were documented and surfaced early.\n- When priorities conflicted across teams, I drove alignment by framing options, impacts, and a recommended path, then closing decisions in writing. Result: avoided rework and kept execution moving without ambiguity.\n\nIf selected, I’m ready to commit to Company_E and start quickly.
