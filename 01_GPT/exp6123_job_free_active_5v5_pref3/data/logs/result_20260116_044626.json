Seeker_B ranks Company_C last and is very unlikely to apply. Seeker_D ranks us #1 and is ready to commit; if we reject now, we may lose a strong, high-ranked candidate and still fail to secure Seeker_C/Seeker_B later.

Please confirm you’re accepting, and we’ll send over the written details and start-date onboarding steps immediately.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Company_A’s true priority list is [Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_E, Seeker_C], so Seeker_C is lowest priority. However, in the current round the only inbound is Seeker_C, and we have no active conversations with higher-priority candidates. Seeker_A/E already applied and were rejected; Seeker_C has now demonstrated strong 1:1 fit to our must-match markers and is ready to accept immediately. Waiting for Seeker_B or Seeker_D is risky because (a) neither has engaged us so far, and (b) their top choices are Company_B/Company_C/Company_D ahead of Company_A, so they may never apply. With quota=1 and a qualified, ready-to-accept candidate in hand, accepting Seeker_C maximizes the chance of filling the role with an in-list candidate rather than ending unfilled."
