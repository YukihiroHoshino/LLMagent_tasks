Higher-priority seekers (B/D/A) may still be unmatched/able to apply, and accepting E now would forfeit the chance to match with a higher-priority candidate within our quota. Since Seeker_E is asking about whether we’re holding for someone and timeline, we should answer candidly without committing to accept; keep the channel in TALK and set expectations: we are holding for higher-priority candidates through remaining rounds (or a defined window), and if none materialize we still may choose to leave unfilled this cycle."
