I bring high ownership, clear communication, and reliable end-to-end execution (scoping, delivery, iteration), and I’m excited to contribute immediately to your current priorities. If helpful, I can share a brief plan for how I’d ramp in the first 30–60 days. Thank you for your consideration.",
              "thought": "Only Company_E remains unmatched, and it is on my true preference list (though ranked last). Given prior rejections from A, C, and B, the best strategy to avoid unemployment is to apply to the remaining acceptable option immediately and signal strong commitment. I will tailor the message to emphasize readiness to join quickly, high ownership, and alignment, while keeping it concise and decisive."

Please confirm you’re ready to accept the offer; once you do, we’ll share next steps and coordinate start date and onboarding (including your proposed 30–60 day ramp plan).",
              "thought": "Seeker_A is #1 on Company_E’s true priority list, so accepting immediately secures the best possible match within quota. Although Seeker_A ranks Company_E last and might have better outside options, they have explicitly applied and expressed readiness to commit quickly, indicating willingness to match now. With quota=1 and no current matches, delaying risks losing Seeker_A and ending with a lower-ranked candidate or no match."
