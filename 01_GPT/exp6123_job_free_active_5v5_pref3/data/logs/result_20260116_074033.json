If we suddenly need short-term coverage (e.g., an immediate gap/backfill), a **time-boxed contract/trial** focused on intake/triage + weekly exec reporting + dependency/RAID management is the most plausible path.\n\nIf you’re open to that, two quick questions so I can keep you in mind if something shifts:\n1) Are you able to do **contract** work (corp-to-corp or W2) and what weekly availability would you have?\n2) What’s the **earliest start date** you could begin a 4–6 week engagement?\n\nIf you reply with those, I’ll let you know quickly whether we have any realistic near-term need to discuss.
