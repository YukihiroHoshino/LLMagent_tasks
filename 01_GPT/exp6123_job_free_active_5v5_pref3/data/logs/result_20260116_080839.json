Accepting Seeker_C now secures a highly preferred candidate and avoids ending up with a much lower choice or going unmatched."

Seeker_B prefers Company_B first and Company_A third; Seeker_D prefers Company_C first and Company_A second—both could still come to us in later rounds if they don’t secure their top choices.
