I ran stakeholder interviews (Sales/Support/Product), mapped the funnel, and turned loosely defined complaints into a prioritized plan. Timeline: 3 weeks from kickoff to shipping v1. I coordinated design + eng, wrote the PRD, defined success metrics, and managed weekly updates.\nMeasurable outcome: reduced onboarding drop-off by ~18% and cut Support tickets related to setup by ~25% over the following month (measured via funnel analytics + ticket tags).\n\n(2) How I’d structure my first 2 weeks to deliver a tangible quick win:\nDays 1–2: Align on the single most important deliverable + definition of done; identify stakeholders and set a tight comms cadence (daily async update + 2 check-ins/week).\nDays 3–5: Translate ambiguity into a plan: clarify requirements, risks, dependencies; propose a thin-slice v1 that can ship fast; confirm metrics + rollout plan.\nWeek 2: Execute and ship the thin-slice quick win (instrumentation + small workflow/UX/process change), then report results and next steps.

Stakeholders wanted a broad “perfect” onboarding overhaul, but we had to ship in 3 weeks. I cut scope to a thin slice focused on the single biggest drop-off step, accepted some manual/internal tooling for v1, and deferred edge cases to v2. If I did it again, I’d instrument a bit earlier (day 2–3) and pre-align stakeholders on explicit non-goals in writing to reduce late-stage scope pressure.\n\n2) One thin-slice v1 quick win I’d target for you without full context (and why):\nI’d target a fast, end-to-end deliverable that improves execution visibility and reduces ambiguity for stakeholders—specifically: a lightweight “single-source-of-truth” delivery cadence (clear owner, definition of done, weekly milestones, risk log, and a simple metric dashboard) paired with shipping one small but measurable workflow improvement. Reason: it creates immediate stakeholder confidence, surfaces bottlenecks quickly, and produces a tangible shipped outcome while we learn the real constraints of the org.\n\nHappy to meet in any of the windows above—just send the invite and I’ll join.",

Also, to make the 10 minutes as concrete as possible, reply with:\n1) Your preferred email for the calendar invite, and\n2) One sentence on the kind of role you’re targeting day-to-day (e.g., PM / ops / program / generalist) so I can calibrate questions.\n\n[TALK]",

However, in the current market state, only Seeker_E is engaging Company_A and no higher-priority candidates (Seeker_B/Seeker_D/Seeker_A) are in the inbox this round. With quota=1 and the role still unfilled, it is optimal to keep the conversation moving while preserving the option to accept a higher-priority candidate if they appear later. Therefore, continue with [TALK] and schedule the 10-minute screen promptly to validate fit and maintain momentum."

Seeker_E has demonstrated strong alignment with our stated top need (end-to-end ownership, execution speed, crisp stakeholder comms) through multiple high-signal interactions, and is actively applying now.
