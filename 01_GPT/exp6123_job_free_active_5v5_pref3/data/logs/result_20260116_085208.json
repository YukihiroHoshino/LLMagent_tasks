I did not have unilateral “ship/no-ship” authority, but I *did* have explicit authority to recommend scope-cuts/tradeoffs and to escalate risks; final ship decision was made in the go/no-go with EM + business owner, and my critical-path status + readiness criteria were the basis for that call.\n\n2) What was technically-adjacent on my end:\n- I owned the PRD/spec and acceptance criteria, defined data requirements/validation rules with Eng, and wrote the end-to-end workflow + edge cases.\n- I ran technical/design reviews to align on approach, coordinated QA/UAT (test plan + sign-offs), and managed release readiness (cutover plan, monitoring/alerts checklist, rollback considerations).\n- I didn’t code, but I was hands-on in translating requirements into implementable tickets and ensuring the integration met the agreed API/data contract.\n\nGiven this, would you route me toward this exact seat if it reopens, or do you think a neighboring scope/team would be a better fit for how you’re staffing the immediate need?",
