Between them, Seeker_D is higher on our true priority list than Seeker_E, so accepting Seeker_D weakly dominates accepting Seeker_E if we want to fill now. However, we should consider the chance of landing Seeker_C or Seeker_B later. Seeker_C’s top choices are Company_D then Company_A then Company_B then Company_C (we are 4th), so unlikely to come soon. Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, so very unlikely. Seeker_A ranks Company_C 2nd, but may pursue Company_A first. Seeker_D ranks Company_C 1st and has applied now, offering high certainty. With quota 1 and strong likelihood that higher-priority seekers won’t apply to us, accept Seeker_D now to secure a decent (3rd) choice rather than risk ending with lower or unfilled."

I want to be transparent, though: we are still in conversations/consideration for a small set of candidates we’re prioritizing ahead of others, so I can’t promise we’ll be able to move to an offer even with an updated note.\n\nIf you send the examples, we’ll take another look this round.",
