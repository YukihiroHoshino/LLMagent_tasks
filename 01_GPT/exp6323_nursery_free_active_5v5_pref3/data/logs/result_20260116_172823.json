              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority is A > C > B > E > D, so Parent_E is only 4th. Parent_E is engaging, flexible, and ready to enroll, but accepting now could block a higher-priority parent if they later apply (especially Parent_A/Parent_C, who currently rank Nursery_E last and may come only after rejections elsewhere). Since Parent_E sent [TALK] (not [APPLY]), I should keep them warm without committing, preserving the option to accept later if higher-priority parents don’t materialize as rounds progress. Gather any final details needed for quick conversion to an offer and set expectations about timing."

Parent_E has applied twice before and was rejected; they are now in TALK mode and highly flexible, but accepting them now would lock the single seat and could prevent matching with higher-priority parents (Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B) if they approach in later rounds. Also, Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last, so they may be shopping and could leave if given another offer, reducing reliability. Since Parent_E did not APPLY this round, I should continue TALK, keep them warm, and avoid committing while waiting for higher-priority candidates to potentially engage."
