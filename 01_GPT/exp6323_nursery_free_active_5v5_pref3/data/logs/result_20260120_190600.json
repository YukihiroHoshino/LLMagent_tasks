However, holding out is risky because Parent_C has us as first choice and is ready to commit, and other nurseries may accept them quickly (e.g., Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_C #1).

If we accept Parent_B now, we lose the chance to take Parent_D/Parent_A should they come. Since we can reject and try to attract higher-priority candidates, and Parent_B has other options (Nursery_D, A, E, C), the best strategy to maximize our match is to reject now and keep the seat open for higher-priority parents."

However, Parent_C (my top choice) is not currently in my inbox and may still apply in later rounds. Given the one-seat quota, accepting Parent_D now would block a potential match with Parent_C or Parent_B. I should consider the likelihood they apply to me: Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (after D, A, B), so they are unlikely to come to me early; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, very unlikely. Meanwhile, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to commit, making this a strong and reliable match. With limited rounds but wanting a high-priority feasible match, accepting Parent_D now is a good outcome (3rd on my list) and better than risking ending with a lower-ranked parent or no match."
