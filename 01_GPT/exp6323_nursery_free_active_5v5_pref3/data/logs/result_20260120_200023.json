However, Parent_C and Parent_B may still apply later; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they are less likely to come to us early (or at all). Given only one applicant in the inbox this round and the risk of ending unmatched if we wait, it is strategically better to accept Parent_D now rather than reject and hope for higher-priority candidates who have weaker interest in Nursery_C."

My second choice, Nursery_B, ranks me last, so that’s also weak. Nursery_D is my 4th choice but it ranks me 2nd (behind only Parent_D). Since Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C, there’s a good chance Parent_D applies to Nursery_C first, giving me a strong shot at securing Nursery_D early.

Looking at Parent_D’s preferences (Nursery_C first, then A, then B), they will likely apply to C and/or A before us; and nurseries C and A rank Parent_D highly enough that Parent_D has a strong chance to be taken before reaching Nursery_B.
