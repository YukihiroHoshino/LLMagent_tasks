Check likelihood: Parent_D’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_A then Nursery_B, so they may come to us if rejected by C/A. Parent_A ranks us 4th, so less likely to apply early. Since we must either accept or reject on an APPLY, and there is no mechanism to hold, optimal is to reject now to preserve the chance at Parent_D (top) who has a plausible path to us. Risk: could end unmatched if D and A never come; but D’s preferences make them a realistic future applicant. Therefore reject Parent_B politely, encouraging them to pursue other options."

Parent_E’s top is Nursery_C as well; Nursery_C ranks Parent_E 4th, so Parent_E might be displaced and could apply to us later (they rank Nursery_D 4th). Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 2nd and could also apply. Since Parent_C is a solid acceptable option and is our 3rd choice, but there is meaningful chance of getting Parent_D or Parent_E later, rejecting now preserves capacity but risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never come.

Given we are at round 10/30 and still unmatched, there is a tradeoff between waiting for higher-priority candidates and securing a mid-priority match. Since Parent_E is within our acceptable list and is higher than Parent_C, and repeated rejections have not attracted higher-priority applicants so far, it is reasonable to accept Parent_E now to avoid ending unmatched."
