At that point, we expect to either (i) move to an offer with a shortlisted family, or (ii) confirm that we are keeping the place unfilled pending further movement.\n\nIf you would like to remain in consideration for a potential short-notice offer after that decision point, please reply confirming that your **immediate start** and **7:15am–6:15pm Mon–Fri** commitment still stands through Round 18.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority list is A > C > B > E > D, so Parent_E is 4th choice. We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so holding the seat is only beneficial if there is a realistic chance to attract Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B later. From the global preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last but is actively pursuing us. Given Parent_A and Parent_C are extremely unlikely to approach Nursery_E, and Parent_B is only a moderate possibility, continuing to delay risks ending unmatched. However, Parent_E has repeatedly applied and been rejected; accepting now would secure a match but sacrifices the option to wait for Parent_B. Since Parent_E is currently only [TALK], we can keep flexibility this round by responding with [TALK] and provide a concrete decision point, while not committing yet. Set a near-term deadline (e.g., by round 18) after which, if still unmatched with higher-priority candidates, we will decide whether to offer to remaining interested families. This manages Parent_E’s planning and preserves optionality for higher-ranked candidates."
