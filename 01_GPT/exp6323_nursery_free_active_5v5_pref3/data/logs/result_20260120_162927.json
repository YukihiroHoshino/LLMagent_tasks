However, Parent_D (our top choice) prefers Nursery_C then A then B then E then D (us last), so they are unlikely to apply to us unless rejected elsewhere. Parent_E ranks us 4th, also unlikely to apply early. Given quota=1 and the low probability that Parent_D or Parent_E will come to us later, accepting Parent_C now maximizes our expected outcome versus waiting and risking ending unmatched or with a lower-priority applicant (Parent_B/Parent_A)."

Given we have quota 1 and already have a higher-priority applicant (Parent_D) in hand, accepting Parent_E now would block a better match.

Between these two, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_D weakly dominates accepting Parent_E. However, Parent_C and Parent_B are higher priorities and may still be available, but there is no mechanism described to hold offers or make conditional acceptances; if I reject Parent_D now, I risk ending up with Parent_E or no one, since Parent_D has Nursery_C as first choice and could match elsewhere if turned away. Also, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks it 5th, so they are unlikely to apply to me early (or at all) unless rejected by their top choices. Given the immediate high-quality applicant (3rd on my list) and inability to wait safely, I should accept Parent_D now to secure a relatively high-priority match."
