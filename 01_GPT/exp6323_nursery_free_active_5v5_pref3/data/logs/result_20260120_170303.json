Given the full market preferences, Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as 3rd and may apply later if rejected elsewhere (likely to try Nursery_C first, then Nursery_A). Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th and is unlikely to come early. With only one seat, accepting Parent_B now guarantees a decent match but risks missing a higher-priority Parent_D if they approach us in subsequent rounds.

Given the market information, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last—so demand for Nursery_E is generally low, but Parent_B is the only higher-priority parent who might plausibly apply if unmatched elsewhere.
