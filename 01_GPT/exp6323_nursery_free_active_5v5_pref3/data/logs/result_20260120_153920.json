If I accept now, I lock in a decent match but lose the chance to match with higher-priority Parent_D or Parent_A if they apply later. Check parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd (after C and A), so they may apply to C/A first and only come to me if rejected. Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th, unlikely to reach me early. Given uncertainty and to maximize chance at higher-priority candidates, I should reject Parent_B now rather than commit, hoping to attract Parent_D or Parent_A in later rounds."

However, Parent_C is applying now and ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice, so acceptance would form an immediate, secure match. Waiting for Parent_D or Parent_E is risky: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (Nursery_C ranks Parent_D 3rd, but may still accept), and Parent_E’s top choice is Nursery_C as well (Nursery_C ranks Parent_E 4th). Both may never apply to Nursery_D, and with quota 1 it is better to lock in a high-priority acceptable parent now rather than risk ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked parent later.

Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_E now would block a better available candidate. Also, Parent_C (our top) and Parent_B (second) have not applied yet; delaying commitment could improve our outcome, but the protocol requires accept/reject on APPLY.

In this round I have applications from Parent_D and Parent_E; Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_D dominates accepting Parent_E. However, I should consider whether I can realistically secure Parent_C or Parent_B later if I keep my seat open. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (behind D, A, B) and is likely to be taken by Nursery_D (which ranks Parent_C 3rd) or Nursery_A (ranks Parent_C last) / Nursery_B (ranks Parent_C 4th), so Parent_C is not a reliable future match for me. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so also very unlikely to come. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is applying now; if I reject, I may end up with a worse match or unfilled. Therefore, accept Parent_D now to secure a relatively high-priority and committed applicant."
