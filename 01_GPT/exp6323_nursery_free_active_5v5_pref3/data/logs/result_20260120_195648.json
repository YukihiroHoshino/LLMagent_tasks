Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 1st and is applying now, making them a reliable and relatively high-priority match.

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and no current match. Our true priority ranks Parent_E as 4th (above only Parent_D), while Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B are preferred. However, none of those higher-priority parents are in our inbox this round, and given their preference lists Nursery_E is last for A/C/E and 4th for B, so it is unlikely they will apply soon. We have already rejected Parent_E twice but explicitly invited a formal APPLY this round to move to a firm decision pathway; rejecting again risks ending unmatched. With round 16 ongoing and a willing parent ready to accept immediately, accepting Parent_E secures a filled spot, which is better than remaining vacant with low probability of higher-priority interest arriving in time."
