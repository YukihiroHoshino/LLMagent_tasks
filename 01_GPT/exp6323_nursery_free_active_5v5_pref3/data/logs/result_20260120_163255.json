We should consider whether holding out could secure Parent_D or Parent_E. However, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last, so they are very unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else. Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 4th and is more likely to match with Nursery_C/B/A before reaching us. Parent_C ranks us 1st and will commit immediately, giving us a high-quality, stable match. Accepting Parent_C now maximizes expected outcome given the low probability of attracting Parent_D/E later."

Since quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now would block the possibility of matching with Parent_D (or potentially even higher-ranked Parent_C/Parent_B in later rounds). Given Parent_D also lists Nursery_C as first choice, the best move to maximize my outcome is to reject Parent_E and keep capacity for higher-priority candidates."

Between them, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_D is better than accepting Parent_E. However, Parent_C (our top choice) is likely to apply to Nursery_D first (their first choice), and Parent_B is unlikely to apply to us (we are their last choice). Parent_C could still become available later if rejected by Nursery_D and others, but that is uncertain. Parent_D has us as first choice and will likely commit immediately; accepting now secures a relatively high-priority match (3rd) and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked parent or an unfilled seat. Therefore, accept Parent_D."

However, on Nursery_B’s true priority list, Parent_B ranks 3rd (behind Parent_D and Parent_A). Given the market preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd (after Nursery_C and Nursery_A), so they may not approach us immediately; Parent_A ranks us 4th, also unlikely early. Still, with quota 1, accepting Parent_B now would prevent us from taking a higher-priority parent if they later apply. In round 1, it is strategically better to wait and try to attract Parent_D/Parent_A rather than lock in a lower-ranked match immediately."
