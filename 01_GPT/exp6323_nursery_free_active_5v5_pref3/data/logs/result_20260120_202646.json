              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority order A > C > B > E > D. Parent_E is 4th. However, by round 15 no higher-priority parents (A/C/B) have engaged with Nursery_E, and given their preference lists Nursery_E is last for all of them, making it unlikely they will ever apply unless rejected everywhere else very late. Continuing to hold risks ending unmatched. Parent_E has repeatedly demonstrated readiness to accept immediately and flexibility, reducing execution risk. Therefore accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than gamble on unlikely higher-priority arrivals."
