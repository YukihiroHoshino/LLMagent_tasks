Check likelihood: Parent_D’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_A then Nursery_B (we are 3rd), so they may not reach us unless rejected by C/A. Parent_A ranks us 4th, unlikely to apply early. However, it is only round 1 and no other applicants are currently in our inbox; still, strategically we should hold out for higher-ranked candidates rather than commit immediately.

However, Parent_D (my top choice) has not applied yet and, based on their preferences, Nursery_D is their last choice, so it is unlikely they will apply unless rejected elsewhere. Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 4th, also not very likely to come soon.

The only higher-priority parent is Parent_A, but Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, so it is unlikely they will apply unless rejected everywhere else, and waiting risks ending unmatched. Parent_E (lower priority) is also applying again, but I should prefer Parent_C over Parent_E. Accepting Parent_C now secures a high-priority match within quota and avoids the risk of losing them to other nurseries, since Parent_C prefers several other nurseries over Nursery_E and may not keep applying here if delayed/rejected."
