Given the current stage of the process and your readiness to enroll on short notice, we’re able to offer you the available place at Nursery_E. Please reply to confirm, and we’ll send the enrollment steps (start date confirmation, required documents, and deposit/paperwork details).",

Although accepting now would fill our only spot, the market still has higher-priority parents (A/C/B) who may yet approach us; however, based on all parents’ preferences, Nursery_E is the last choice for every parent, so the chance that Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B will apply to us soon is extremely low. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is ready to commit immediately. With round 6 ongoing and the risk of ending unmatched if we keep waiting, accepting Parent_E now maximizes expected outcome given realistic applicant arrival."
