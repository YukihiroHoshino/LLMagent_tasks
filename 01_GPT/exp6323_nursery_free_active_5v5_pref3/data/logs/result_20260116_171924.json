However, both list Nursery_B as their 3rd (Parent_D) and 4th (Parent_A) choices, so they could come to us later if rejected by higher choices. If we accept Parent_B now, we forgo the chance to match with D or A later. Since we can’t hold offers and acceptance finalizes match, strategically reject now to preserve capacity for higher-priority parents, given early round and reasonable chance they may approach later.

Since the parent used [APPLY], we must choose ACCEPT or REJECT; strategically REJECT to preserve option value for higher-priority candidates."

If there is documentation you need to assess this (proof of address, proposed schedule, start date confirmation, etc.), I can provide it immediately.\n\nNursery_A is still a strong option for our family, and if an offer becomes possible we can confirm acceptance the same day and complete all onboarding paperwork right away.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

However, in the current round the only inbound message is from E (TALK), and we remain unmatched at round 11, suggesting B and D may be pursuing/holding other options (B prefers Nursery_B/D over A; D prefers Nursery_C then A). Since E is asking about criteria and is willing to provide documentation, we should keep the channel open without committing, to preserve the chance to match with B or D if they apply later. Therefore respond with TALK, reiterate we cannot disclose full internal ordering or pre-offer, and invite E to apply again while clarifying what documentation is typically required."
