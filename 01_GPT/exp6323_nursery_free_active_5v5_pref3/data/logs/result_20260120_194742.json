Between these two, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_D weakly dominates accepting Parent_E given my objective. While Parent_C and Parent_B are higher priorities, neither has contacted me yet; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply soon (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st, so accepting now secures a high-likelihood stable match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-priority parent later. Therefore, accept Parent_D."

However, Parent_D (our #1) prefers Nursery_C first and lists Nursery_D last, so they are unlikely to apply here early (or at all). Parent_E ranks Nursery_D as #4, also not very likely to apply early. Given quota=1 and only one applicant in round 1, accepting Parent_C secures a relatively high-priority match with low risk of forgoing a better candidate who is unlikely to come. Therefore accept."

Given full information: Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_B (Nursery_A is 3rd), and Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (Nursery_A is 2nd). So Parent_D is a plausible future applicant to Nursery_A if they don’t secure Nursery_C, and Parent_B could also come if Nursery_B rejects them.
