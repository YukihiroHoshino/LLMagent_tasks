Check parents’ preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last. So it is relatively unlikely that A or C will ever apply to Nursery_E, and even B/D may only come if rejected elsewhere. However, with rounds remaining, holding the spot could still yield Parent_B (ranked above E) or even Parent_A/C if market dynamics push them. We have already rejected Parent_E multiple times; switching to accept now could be justified due to low likelihood of higher-priority applicants, but objective is to match as high as possible, not to fill quickly. Given no other applicants in inbox this round and significant time left (round 8/30), continue to keep option open by rejecting the apply to avoid commitment; we can reconsider later if time runs out or if it becomes clear no higher-priority parent will approach."
