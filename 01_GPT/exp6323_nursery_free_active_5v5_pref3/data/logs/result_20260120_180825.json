If, after the reassessment, you are able to move to my position in your priority order (i.e., no higher-priority family has applied and can commit), I will accept immediately, complete all enrollment steps the same day, and withdraw from all other options. Thank you for reconsidering—please let me know right after the reassessment if you are able to offer me the place.",

Parent_A already applied earlier and was rejected; Parent_B and Parent_D have never applied to Nursery_A and both prefer other nurseries first (B prefers Nursery_B/D; D prefers Nursery_C first). However, they might become unmatched later and apply. We are at Round 16 with quota 1 and still unmatched; continued waiting risks ending unmatched if no one applies by Round 30. Given the history, we have repeatedly told Parent_E we are holding for higher-priority families, but none have appeared for many rounds, and Parent_E can commit immediately. To avoid going unfilled and because Parent_E is still on our acceptable priority list, accept now."
