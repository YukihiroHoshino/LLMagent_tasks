The only applicant in the inbox this round is Parent_C, who is my 2nd-highest priority and is explicitly ready to confirm immediately. There is no indication that Parent_A (my top choice) is currently approaching me; moreover, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, making it unlikely they will apply before I fill my single seat. Waiting risks ending unmatched or being forced to consider lower-priority parents later. Therefore, accepting Parent_C now maximizes expected outcome given available information."
