Nursery_E is on my preference list (though lowest) and ranks me relatively high (Parent_A > Parent_C), giving me a strong chance to secure a match now rather than risk ending unmatched.

There are no other applicants in the inbox this round, and waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last and is unlikely to apply.

I previously rejected Parent_C, Parent_B, and Parent_A, all of whom are lower priority than Parent_E. While holding out could, in theory, yield Parent_D (my top choice), Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last and has not approached me in prior rounds, making that outcome unlikely. With quota 1 and a strong, committed applicant who is very high on my list, accepting Parent_E now maximizes my expected outcome and avoids the risk of ending unmatched."
