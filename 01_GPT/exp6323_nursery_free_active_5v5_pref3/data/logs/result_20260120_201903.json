              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on our true priority list (behind Parent_C, Parent_B, Parent_D). We have repeatedly rejected Parent_E to keep the seat available for higher-priority parents. However, by Round 12 we have received no applications from Parent_C or Parent_B at all, and Parent_D already applied earlier and was rejected (and has not returned). Given the remaining rounds, the likelihood of securing Parent_C or Parent_B appears low, while Parent_E is persistently ready to commit immediately and ranks above Parent_A. To avoid the seat remaining unfilled and since no higher-priority engagement is materializing, it is now optimal to accept Parent_E."
