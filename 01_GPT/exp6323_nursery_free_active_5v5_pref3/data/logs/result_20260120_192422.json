As requested, here are the details so you can move quickly if you reopen offers:\n\n1) Preferred start window: We can start immediately (as early as next week) or anytime that suits your intake; no restrictions.\n2) Days/hours: Ideally full-time Monday–Friday, roughly 8:30am–5:30pm, but we can adjust earlier/later and can also do part-time if that’s what’s available.\n3) Non-negotiables/constraints: No allergies or medical needs to flag. Pickup is flexible (two authorized adults available), and we can comply with any standard policies and paperwork right away.\n\nIf it helps, please let me know what the best way is to proceed in Round 8—should I send a formal [APPLY] then, or will you reach out if you’re ready to offer the place?",

From parents’ preference lists, Nursery_E is last choice for all parents, so it is unlikely Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B will ever apply here unless they are rejected everywhere else, which may or may not happen before Round 30. Holding the seat longer risks ending unmatched, which is worse than accepting a listed (acceptable) parent. Parent_E has shown strong commitment and immediate acceptance, reducing execution risk. Therefore accept now to secure a match within quota."
