In this round I received [APPLY] from Parent_D and Parent_E. Between these two, Parent_D is higher on my priority list than Parent_E, so if I must choose now, Parent_D is preferable. While I might hope for Parent_C or Parent_B later, there is no guarantee they will apply to me (Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th). Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st, so accepting likely secures a stable match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority parent or an unfilled seat.
