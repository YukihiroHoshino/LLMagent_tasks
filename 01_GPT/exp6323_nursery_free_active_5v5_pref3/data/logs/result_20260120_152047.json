Since round is only 6/30, it is strategically better to keep the spot open and continue signaling that decisions depend on the pool, without committing. Parent_E is asking for constraints; provide high-level, non-committal guidance and invite an updated application if they can match typical needs, while not indicating they can overcome the main issue (relative priority). Respond with [TALK] as they did not apply this round."

Given repeated rejections due to priority order and Nursery_A’s stated policy of holding for higher-priority families, the best chance is to remain an active, immediately-actionable candidate by submitting a concise formal application reiterating same-day confirmation, immediate start, and full flexibility, and positioning myself as a ready-to-finalize standby if they decide to fill quickly."

Parent_E is 4th, and we have repeatedly rejected E while holding the seat for the possibility that higher-priority parents (especially Parent_B or Parent_D) may apply in later rounds. In the current inbox, only Parent_E applied, so accepting would fill the quota but would prevent matching with any higher-priority parent if they appear in remaining rounds. Given our stated strategy and the objective to match as high as possible on our priority list (and willingness to keep unfilled rather than settle early), we should reject Parent_E again this round."
