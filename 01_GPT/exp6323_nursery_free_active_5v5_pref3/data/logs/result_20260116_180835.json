Check likely availability: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C, then Nursery_A, then us (Nursery_B). Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_C first, then Parent_B, then Parent_D; so Parent_D may be rejected by Nursery_C if Parent_C applies there, and could flow to Nursery_A (which prioritizes Parent_D highly) before reaching us. Parent_A ranks us 4th and is unlikely to apply early. Given uncertainty and that Parent_B is still a relatively high priority (3rd) and is strongly interested (first choice), accepting secures a good match and avoids risk of ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never reach us.

The specific condition under which we would reconsider your application is if we are unable to finalize an enrollment with one of those families (or if their circumstances change) and the place remains unfilled.\n\nIn terms of timing: we expect to have more clarity very soon. If the place is still not filled, we will re-check our active files and may reach back out on short notice. If you are able to accept immediately if contacted (same-day/next-day confirmation), please reply to confirm that, and also let us know if you receive an offer elsewhere in the meantime.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_A Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_A’s true priority list, and we have already rejected them multiple times. Our top priorities are Parent_B and Parent_D (then Parent_A). Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may come if rejected by Nursery_B/Nursery_D; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd and may come if Nursery_C doesn’t work out. Since quota is 1, accepting Parent_E now risks blocking a higher-priority match. Parent_E is only TALKing; we should keep them warm without committing, provide a clear but non-binding timeline/condition: we would reconsider only if we cannot place a higher-priority family by a certain round/date. Continue to avoid revealing exact priority order; state we are still in conversations and will decide soon. Ask them to keep us updated if they receive other offers; confirm they can accept on short notice."

We have already rejected Parent_E multiple times and are keeping the seat open to try to secure a higher-priority parent if they apply. In the broader market, Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may apply if rejected elsewhere; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd and could also come if Nursery_C doesn’t work out. Since Parent_E is only talking (not applying) and is willing to accept immediately, the best strategy is to keep them warm as a fallback without committing or revealing too much, while giving a reasonable decision window to maintain credibility and avoid losing the option. Continue [TALK] and provide a short rough timeline, plus request they remain reachable and confirm willingness to accept on short notice."

We previously rejected Parent_E multiple times while waiting for higher-priority candidates (B, D, A). In this round, only Parent_E applied to us. Given the market dynamics: Parent_B’s first choice is Nursery_B; Parent_D’s first choice is Nursery_C; Parent_A’s first choice is Nursery_A but we already rejected them; Parent_E prefers Nursery_C/B over us but is now repeatedly applying and ready to commit immediately. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply to us (likely, since they have higher-ranked options). Accepting Parent_E now secures a match rather than leaving the seat empty, and Parent_E is on our acceptable list. Therefore, accept."
