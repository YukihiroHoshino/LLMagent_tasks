Given the one-shot accept/reject nature of an [APPLY], rejecting Parent_C to wait for a higher-priority parent is risky and could leave our seat unfilled. Therefore accept Parent_C now."

              "thought": "Nursery_C quota is 1 and currently unfilled. My true priority order is Parent_C > Parent_B > Parent_D > Parent_E > Parent_A. In this round, I received applications from Parent_A and Parent_E only; Parent_E ranks higher than Parent_A. Although Parent_E is not my top choice, holding out risks ending up with Parent_A (lower) or remaining unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply. Given repeated applications from Parent_E (high commitment; Nursery_C is their first choice) and no sign that Parent_C or Parent_B will apply to me (they rank Nursery_C low), accepting Parent_E now secures a better outcome than accepting Parent_A or waiting with uncertain upside."
