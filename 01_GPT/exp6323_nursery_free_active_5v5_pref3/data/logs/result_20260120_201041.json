My details remain unchanged:\n- Child age: 3 years\n- Start: ASAP (immediately) or from the 1st of next month\n- Schedule: Mon–Fri ~8:30–5:30 (flexible), and happy with a temporary reduced settling-in schedule\n- Funding: private and/or funded hours with top-up as needed\n- Additional support needs: none known\n\nIf you are at the point where you can consider me, please explicitly invite my formal [APPLY] and I will submit it immediately and can accept the same day.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

I have already applied multiple times and was told to wait for an explicit invitation to re-apply; applying again now would likely be ignored or rejected while higher-priority talks continue. In round 16, the best move is to [TALK] to (1) reconfirm I am still available and fully flexible, (2) ask for a concrete decision point within their stated next 1–2 rounds, and (3) request that they explicitly invite my [APPLY] immediately if/when they are ready so we can finalize same-round."

If the place is still unfilled once those higher-priority discussions conclude and we are able to consider you, we will message you promptly in round 17 and explicitly invite your [APPLY] so we can move straight to a same-round decision.\n\nIf you have any external deadline before or during round 17 (e.g., another offer expiring), please tell us the specific round/date and we will do our best to give you the clearest possible status update.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority is A > C > B > E > D. Parent_E is 4th, so accepting now would likely block a better match if Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B later apply. Parent_E has only ranked Nursery_E last, so they may keep trying elsewhere; however, they are persistent and can serve as a fallback if higher-priority talks fail. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], we should continue to hold without inviting an [APPLY], provide a concrete update window (round 17) consistent with prior message, and keep them warm while preserving flexibility to accept a higher-priority parent if they appear."

No other parents contacted us this round, so rejecting Parent_E risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply or accept elsewhere. Parent_E has repeatedly demonstrated immediate acceptance, flexible start/schedule, and operational fit. Given the late round (17/30) and uncertainty of securing Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B, accepting Parent_E now maximizes the chance of filling our single seat with an acceptable candidate from our priority list rather than remaining empty."
