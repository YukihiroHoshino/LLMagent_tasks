Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to commit, so accepting now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-priority parent if higher-priority candidates never apply.

If the place frees up, we will contact you immediately.\n\n2) If the place opens—what else we’d need beyond scanned documents: Once your ID / proof of address / immunization record are scanned, the only additional items typically needed to issue an offer quickly are:\n- Confirmation of your preferred start date (even if “immediately”) at the time we call\n- Completion/signature of our enrollment agreement (we can do this same-day)\n- Funding/payment setup details (e.g., whether you intend to use any childcare funding scheme vs. full private fee payment), which we can also capture quickly once an offer is made\n\nYou’ve already provided the key operational details (schedule flexibility + emergency contact), so scanning the documents is the main remaining step to keep you “ready to move” if the place becomes available.\n\nSee you tomorrow morning, and we will update you right away if there is a definitive change on the place.\n\n[TALK]",

So Parent_E is a plausible eventual match if the seat opens, but I should not accept now (they did not APPLY) and should keep them warm as backup while leaving room for any higher-priority parent if they unexpectedly approach.

              "thought": "We are Nursery_E with quota 1 and true priority: A > C > B > E > D. Parent_E is 4th, so we should not commit unless higher-priority parents are unavailable. Parent_E is only talking, not applying; we can keep them warm as backup while avoiding any promise that could block a better match. Round 29 is late, but still possible higher-priority parents may approach; we should continue to state place is pending and confirm contact/hold process without offering."

              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority list is [Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_B, Parent_E, Parent_D], so Parent_E ranks 4th. Accepting Parent_E now would permanently fill our only quota and prevent matching with any higher-priority parent if they become available. Parent_E also ranks Nursery_E last, implying they are likely applying only as a fallback, while higher-priority parents may still be in play elsewhere. Given it is round 30, but no evidence that higher-priority parents are unavailable; the place is stated as still pending with other families. Therefore, to maximize chance of matching with a higher-ranked parent, we reject Parent_E’s application while keeping them as a non-binding backup (outside the formal match)."
