Considering market: Parent_C’s top choice is Nursery_D, and Parent_B’s top is Nursery_B, so they may never apply to Nursery_C unless rejected elsewhere.

Given all parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last but is persistently applying. Higher-priority candidates may not come at all, but with 24 rounds remaining it is still rational to hold the seat for Parent_B (ranked above E) and especially Parent_A/Parent_C if they unexpectedly reach us. History shows repeated rejections with the same rationale; consistency suggests another rejection while keeping door open to reassess later if the market nears the end and the seat risks going unfilled."

Higher-priority candidates for Nursery_E are Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B; none are currently in the inbox this round, and based on their preferences they are likely pursuing other nurseries first (A prefers A/C/D/B over E; C prefers D/A/B/C over E; B prefers B/D/A over E). Still, it is early (round 7/30), so holding the seat a bit longer could yield a higher-priority match.
