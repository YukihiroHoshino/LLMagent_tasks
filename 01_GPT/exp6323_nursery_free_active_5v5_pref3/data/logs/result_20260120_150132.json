However, Parent_C (my top choice) and Parent_B (second) have not applied yet; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they are unlikely to approach me early, but could if rejected elsewhere. Since an [ACCEPT] creates an immediate match and removes me from the market, accepting now risks losing the chance to match with Parent_C or Parent_B later.
