There is a meaningful chance that either Parent_B or Parent_D could come to me later if rejected elsewhere. If I accept Parent_A now, I forgo the possibility of matching with Parent_B or Parent_D.

Check likelihood: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd (after Nursery_C and Nursery_A) so may not apply immediately; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th so also unlikely to apply early. Parent_E ranks Nursery_B 2nd and might apply, but Nursery_B ranks Parent_E last.

Parent_E is also unlikely to match with us via their own preferences (they rank Nursery_E last), suggesting they are applying only after failing elsewhere; however, with only 5 rounds left, leaving the seat empty is a risk. Still, the objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, and there is no evidence that higher-priority parents (A/C/B) are definitively unavailable yet.

Nursery_E still has quota 1 and is currently unmatched; however, given the repeated pattern of Parent_E applying while higher-priority possibilities remain unresolved, and no new information indicating higher-priority parents are no longer available, it is optimal to continue holding the seat for a higher-priority parent rather than accept Parent_E now."
