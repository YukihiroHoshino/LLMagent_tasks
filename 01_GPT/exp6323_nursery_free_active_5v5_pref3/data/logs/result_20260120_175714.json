However, accepting now could forgo a potential higher-priority match with Parent_C or Parent_B. Looking at parents’ preferences, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and is likely to apply to Nursery_D/A/B before C, so may never reach me. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so is very unlikely to apply. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is applying now, making this a strong, reliable match. Given the low likelihood that Parent_C or Parent_B will apply to Nursery_C before the market closes, it is optimal to accept Parent_D now rather than risk ending unmatched."

To answer directly: at this stage we are not in a position to make an offer yet, as we are keeping the place available while the wider allocation develops and while we see whether families with higher priority for this intake approach us and/or finalize elsewhere.\n\nThat said, there is a realistic scenario in which we could consider you—specifically, if we do not receive (or cannot finalize) an application from higher-priority families in the coming rounds. I can’t give a guaranteed timeline or a formal waitlist commitment through this channel, but you are welcome to check back and/or submit a renewed [APPLY] in a later round for us to reassess based on the then-current situation.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I would also encourage you to continue actively pursuing your higher-ranked options in parallel so you’re not waiting on us.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E admissions",

We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so we should avoid committing to a lower-ranked candidate if there is a reasonable chance that higher-priority parents (A/C/B) may approach later. Given Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last in their preferences, they are likely applying here only after failing elsewhere, which suggests they may keep searching and could later withdraw; however, they are also signaling readiness to accept immediately. Still, our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list; with many rounds remaining, it is strategically better to continue talking rather than accept now. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK], provide candid guidance: we are not ready to offer yet, we would only consider them if higher-priority families do not apply/accept, and we encourage them to pursue other options while checking back. We should not promise a timeline or a waitlist guarantee."
