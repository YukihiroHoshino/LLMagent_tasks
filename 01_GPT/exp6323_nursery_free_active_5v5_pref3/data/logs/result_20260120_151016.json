Even if we had space, Parent_C is ranked below Parent_A on our true priority list, so there is no reason to displace the existing match. Therefore, reject Parent_C while being courteous and clear that we have no availability."

              "thought": "Parent_C is currently applying and is #2 on Nursery_E’s true priority list (only Parent_A is higher). With quota 1 and no other applicants in this round’s inbox, accepting Parent_C secures a very high-priority match immediately. Waiting for Parent_A is risky because Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last and is unlikely to apply; accepting Parent_C dominates the expected outcome versus holding out. Therefore accept."
