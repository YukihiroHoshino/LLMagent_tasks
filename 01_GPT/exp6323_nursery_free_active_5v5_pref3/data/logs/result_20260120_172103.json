Meanwhile, Parent_C has Nursery_D as first choice and is likely to commit, and other nurseries (especially Nursery_C) prioritize Parent_C highly, so delaying could risk losing Parent_C to another match.

However, Parent_C and Parent_B are both higher priority than Parent_D, and neither has applied yet. Given round 1 and that Nursery_C is first choice for Parent_D and Parent_E, there is a reasonable chance Parent_C or Parent_B may apply in later rounds (though they currently rank Nursery_C lower: Parent_C has Nursery_C as 4th; Parent_B has it as 5th, so their likelihood is lower).

              "thought": "As Nursery_A, my true priority order is Parent_B > Parent_D > Parent_A > Parent_E > Parent_C. Parent_E is acceptable but not top-tier. However, by round 15 only Parent_E is actively applying to me; Parent_A previously applied and I rejected, and Parent_B/Parent_D (my top two) have not approached me at all. Given the repeated rounds with no higher-priority applicants engaging and the risk of ending unmatched by round 30, it is now optimal to fill my single quota with the best available active applicant rather than continue holding out indefinitely. Accepting Parent_E yields a match with an acceptable candidate and avoids remaining empty."
