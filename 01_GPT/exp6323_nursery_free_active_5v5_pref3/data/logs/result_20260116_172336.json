Parent_E ranks me 2nd and could apply soon if rejected elsewhere, but I still prefer Parent_B over Parent_E.

Given we previously set a concrete deadline (end of Round 17) and are now in Round 18, credibility matters; but we can still reject while stating that higher-priority families remain in play / allocation still not released. With no commitment mechanism, accepting E is risky relative to objective. Therefore reject and provide a new concrete trigger (short) to avoid endless delay and preserve credibility."
