Given my quota is 1, accepting Parent_B now would block the possibility of matching with Parent_D or Parent_A later.

However, accepting Parent_E now would foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority parents (Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B) if they later apply, and those parents all rank Nursery_E last, so they may only come to us after being rejected elsewhere—making it plausible they could approach in later rounds. Since we prefer higher-ranked parents and have no urgency/penalty stated for remaining unmatched, it is strategically better to keep the seat open rather than accept a lower-priority applicant now. Parent_E has applied twice and we already rejected once; consistency also supports rejecting again unless circumstances changed. Therefore, reject Parent_E to preserve the option for higher-priority matches."
