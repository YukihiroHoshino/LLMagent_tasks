Check likelihood: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (and D ranks us last), so Parent_D is unlikely to apply to us early, if at all. Parent_E’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_B then Nursery_A then us; also Nursery_C/B/A may reject them depending on their priorities. So Parent_E could eventually come to us, but that is uncertain. Given Parent_C is a strong, immediate match (they want us #1) and we risk ending unmatched if we wait too long, it’s optimal to accept Parent_C now rather than gamble on Parent_E arriving later."

However, Parent_C (my top choice) is not in my inbox; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and will likely apply elsewhere first (Nursery_D then A then B). Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so unlikely to apply. If I reject Parent_D now, I may end up unmatched or forced to accept a lower-priority parent later.
