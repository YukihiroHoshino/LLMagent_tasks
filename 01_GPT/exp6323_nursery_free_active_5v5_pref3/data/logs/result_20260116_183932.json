I have quota 1 and no other inbound messages this round, but accepting now could block a higher-priority match (Parent_D or Parent_A). Given full information: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as 3rd choice (after C, A) and may apply later; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th and is unlikely to apply early. Parent_B ranks me 1st and would secure a solid match immediately. With no mechanism to hold offers (must accept/reject on APPLY), the decision is between guaranteed mid-high priority now vs uncertain chance at higher priority later. I will prioritize securing a high-ranked, committed applicant rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked later applicant."

Between these two, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, and I have quota 1. Also, Parent_D lists Nursery_C as first choice, so accepting Parent_D would likely secure a strong match immediately, while rejecting Parent_E preserves capacity for a higher-priority applicant. Therefore I should reject Parent_E now to keep the seat available for Parent_D (or potentially Parent_C/Parent_B if they apply later)."

There is a meaningful chance neither Parent_B nor Parent_D applies to Nursery_A soon (or at all), so holding out risks ending unmatched.
