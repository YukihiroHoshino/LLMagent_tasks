Although Parent_E is highly committed and repeatedly applies, we previously rejected Parent_D (ranked above E) to hold capacity for even higher priorities. Given we still have many rounds remaining (round 21/30) and no information that higher-priority parents are matched elsewhere, accepting Parent_E now would foreclose the chance to match with Parent_C or Parent_B if they apply later.

Parent_E has applied repeatedly and would accept immediately, but accepting now would forfeit any chance to match with higher-priority Parent_C or Parent_B if they apply later. Given the market information: Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (likely to come only if rejected elsewhere), and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last (unlikely but still possible late). With round 22 and no other applicants in my inbox this round, the tradeoff is between securing Parent_E now versus preserving the option value for higher-priority parents. Since my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list (not merely to fill early), and we still have several rounds remaining, I should continue to hold the seat and reject Parent_E this round, consistent with prior communications."

However, in round 23 the only applicant in our inbox is Parent_E; Parent_D previously applied and was rejected, and Parent_A also applied and was rejected. Parent_B and Parent_C (our top two) have not approached us historically and, given their preference lists, they rank Nursery_C last (Parent_B) or fourth (Parent_C), making it unlikely they will apply this late. Continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with an acceptable mid-priority candidate. Parent_E has repeatedly demonstrated immediate commitment and full flexibility, reducing execution risk. Therefore, accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than gambling on unlikely higher-priority arrivals in remaining rounds."
