Given Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd and Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th, they may still apply if rejected elsewhere, so it is strategically better to hold the seat and reject Parent_B now rather than lock in a lower-priority match in round 1."

Between these two, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so accepting Parent_E now would block a better available candidate. Also, Parent_D lists Nursery_C as their first choice, making acceptance likely to stick. While Parent_C and Parent_B are higher priorities, they did not contact me this round and may be pursuing their top choices elsewhere; still, with Parent_D already applying, the best move is to reject Parent_E and preserve capacity for Parent_D (or an even higher-priority parent if they approach later)."

Parent_B ranks us 3rd and Parent_D ranks us 2nd, so either could still come to us in later rounds depending on rejections elsewhere.

This suggests Parent_D is unlikely to apply to us soon (they rank us last), and Parent_E also ranks us 4th, making them less likely to apply early.
