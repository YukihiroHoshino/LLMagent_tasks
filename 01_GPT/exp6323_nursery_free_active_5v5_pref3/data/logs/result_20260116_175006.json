Since Parent_C ranks Nursery_D first, rejecting risks losing them and potentially ending up with a lower-priority parent (Parent_B/#4 or Parent_A/#5) or even going unmatched. Given the low likelihood of Parent_D applying and uncertain arrival of Parent_E, accepting Parent_C now maximizes expected outcome while securing the seat."

Since I can reject now and wait, and there is no penalty stated for rejecting besides possibly ending unmatched, optimal is to hold out for higher-priority candidates, especially Parent_D.

However, Parent_C (my top choice) is likely to apply to Nursery_D first (their first choice) and Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_B first, so they may not approach me in round 1.

Since Nursery_E is the only remaining unmatched nursery and your place is still showing as available, I would like to formally re-confirm our application for the open spot.\n\nWe can accept immediately and complete all enrollment paperwork the same day, and we remain fully flexible on start date and any transition/orientation requirements. If you are still holding the place pending higher-priority families, could you please let us know whether there is a decision point (e.g., by the end of this round) after which you would be able to offer the place to the next eligible family?\n\nWe would be very grateful to join Nursery_E if the place becomes available to us.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

I have already applied twice and been rejected due to higher-priority families possibly taking the seat. Since this is the only remaining option and the seat is still open, I should re-apply with a clear, time-bounded commitment and ask for a definitive update/decision timeline, while reaffirming flexibility and readiness to enroll immediately."

If that changes and we are able to move to the next eligible family, we will reconsider your application.\n\nThank you again for your patience and understanding.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",

Although Parent_E is the only parent contacting and appears to be the only remaining unmatched parent/nursery, accepting now would forgo any chance (within remaining rounds) that a higher-priority parent (A/C/B) might become available if their current match dissolves or if they re-enter the market. Our objective is to match as high as possible on the priority list; we can prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting a lower-priority parent. Therefore, continue to reject Parent_E’s application at this time while keeping door open if circumstances change later."

If you are still holding it, is there a condition you use to decide when to move to the next eligible family (e.g., no response after X rounds / by a certain internal deadline)?\n\nTo reiterate, if you become able to offer the place to us at any point, we can confirm immediately and complete enrollment paperwork the same day.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

I have already applied multiple times and been rejected due to Nursery_E holding the spot for higher-priority families. Re-applying yet again is unlikely to change the outcome without new information. The best move is to use [TALK] to (1) confirm whether any higher-priority families are still actively in contention, (2) ask for a concrete trigger/condition under which they would move to the next eligible family, and (3) restate that I can accept immediately so they can fill the seat the moment they are able."

However, by round 7 Nursery_E is the only remaining unmatched nursery, and Parent_E is the only remaining unmatched parent actively engaging us; higher-priority parents (A/C/B) appear to have secured matches at other nurseries they prefer and are unlikely to apply here (Nursery_E is last choice for A/C and 4th for B). Continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched through round 30, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is on our acceptable list). Since Parent_E is currently only [TALK], we cannot accept yet; we should be transparent at a high level and invite an [APPLY] next round with a clear condition to proceed."

Given the market state described (Nursery_E is the only remaining unmatched nursery) and parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_C ranks it last, Parent_B ranks it 4th, and Parent_D ranks it 4th—so it is increasingly unlikely any higher-priority parent will apply now.
