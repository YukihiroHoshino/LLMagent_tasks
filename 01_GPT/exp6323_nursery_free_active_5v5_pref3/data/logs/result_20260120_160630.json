Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st, making the match stable and likely to persist.

I can also flex earlier pickup/part-time temporarily if that helps with transitions.\n3) Allergies/medical/support needs: No known allergies or medical needs; no special support requirements.\n4) Reference: I can provide a reference from our prior childcare/babysitting arrangement upon request—please tell me the best email/phone format and I will send it the same day.\n\nIf the place becomes available after higher-priority families are resolved, I can confirm acceptance immediately and complete all paperwork/deposit the same day.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",
