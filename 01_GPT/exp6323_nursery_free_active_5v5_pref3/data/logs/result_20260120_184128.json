Higher-priority parents (A/C/B) currently prefer other nurseries over Nursery_E, so they are unlikely to apply here unless rejected elsewhere later. Given we are only at round 6/30, it is rational to keep the seat open a bit longer to try to attract Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B. Parent_E is asking for timeline/info via [TALK], so respond with [TALK], set a clear decision timeline, and request any key details that could allow a fast accept if we decide to fill from waitlist."
