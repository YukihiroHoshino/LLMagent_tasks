Accepting Parent_E now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority parents (Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B) if they approach later. Given the repeated pattern: Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last in their preferences and is likely applying here only after failing elsewhere, while higher-priority parents may still be circulating. With no other applicants in this round’s inbox, the best strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue holding the spot and reject Parent_E’s application this round, consistent with prior rounds, while leaving the door open if higher-priority families do not materialize by later rounds."

However, accepting Parent_E now would forgo the chance to match with a higher-priority parent if they later apply. Check parents' preferences: A ranks Nursery_E last; C ranks E last; B ranks E 4th; D ranks E 4th; E ranks E last. So the probability of A/C choosing us is very low; B/D could come, but likely have better options (B prefers B,D,A first; D prefers C,A,B first). Given late stage (round 18/30) and persistent unfilled seat, the expected value of waiting for A/C/B is low, and leaving seat empty is worse than taking Parent_E (who is on our list). Therefore accept now to secure a match."
