Accepting Parent_E now would lock in a low-ranked match and foreclose any chance of matching with A/C/B if they engage later. From parents’ preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks it last; Parent_B ranks it 4th—so likelihood of higher-priority applicants is low but not zero, especially if they get rejected elsewhere later. However, given we still prefer higher-priority families and can leave the seat unfilled rather than accept outside the list (Parent_E is on the list, but below A/C/B), the priority-consistent move is still to reject and keep the slot open. Also, conditional offers aren’t allowed in this protocol, and committing to a hard deadline could be strategically harmful. Therefore reject while confirming status as of close of Round 20 and reiterating rule."
