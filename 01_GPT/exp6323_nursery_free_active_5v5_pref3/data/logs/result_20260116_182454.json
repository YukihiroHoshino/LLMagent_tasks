Parent_D’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_A then Nursery_B, so they might not come to me immediately; Parent_A ranks me 4th and is unlikely to apply early. However, accepting Parent_B now would fill my only seat and prevent matching with a higher-priority parent if they approach later.

Strategically, holding the spot could yield a higher-priority parent (A/C/B) later, but those parents all rank Nursery_E last as well, so the likelihood they apply here soon is low.
