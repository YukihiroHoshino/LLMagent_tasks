The remaining step on our side would be a brief call/visit to confirm practical details (exact contracted hours, settling-in plan, and paperwork checklist). If you’re available, please share two or three time slots over the next few days that would work for a 10–15 minute call.\n\nWe appreciate your continued interest and will update you as soon as a final decision is made.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E",
