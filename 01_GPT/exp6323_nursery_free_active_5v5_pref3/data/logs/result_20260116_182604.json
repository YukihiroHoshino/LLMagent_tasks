Given full information: Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_B (we are 3rd), and Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (we are 2nd). So there is a meaningful chance neither applies to us, but it’s not negligible that Parent_D could come to us if rejected by Nursery_C, or Parent_B could come to us if Nursery_B/D reject. Since we can’t ‘hold’ with TALK on an APPLY and must accept/reject, the safer strategy to maximize our outcome is to reject now and keep the seat available for higher-priority parents."

However, I should consider whether holding the seat could realistically secure Parent_C or Parent_B. Parent_C’s top choices are Nursery_D then Nursery_A then Nursery_B, with Nursery_C only 4th, so Parent_C is unlikely to approach me early. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so very unlikely to apply. Meanwhile, both Parent_D and Parent_E rank Nursery_C as their 1st choice and are ready to commit, so rejecting Parent_D to wait would risk ending up with a lower-priority match (Parent_E) or no match.
