If you’d like to stay in consideration for that scenario, the most useful details to have on file are: (1) earliest start date, (2) the exact days/hours you can commit to (including whether you can take any specific “hard-to-fill” pattern), and (3) any non-negotiable constraints.\n\nIf you send those specifics, we will keep them on record and will contact you promptly if we reach the point where we can reopen consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

In parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_C ranks it last, so they may never apply; however, it is still early (round 6/30) and leaving the seat open preserves the chance of a higher-priority applicant. Parent_E is only TALKing this round, so I should respond with TALK, be transparent that offer is unlikely unless higher-priority options do not materialize, and specify what would trigger reconsideration (timing near end of rounds / if still vacant)."
