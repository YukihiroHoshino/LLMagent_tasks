Given other parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_C ranks it last, Parent_B ranks it 4th, Parent_D ranks it 4th—so higher-priority families may not come soon, but accepting Parent_E now would eliminate any chance to match with A/C/B if they later approach. Since Parent_E is [TALK], we can be transparent about priority-based holding without committing. Continue conversation, signal we are waiting on higher-priority interest and cannot provide a definitive condition beyond priority/availability; invite them to keep us updated but do not encourage immediate re-apply unless they still want to be considered if seat remains."

Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last. Thus, it is unlikely that A or C will ever apply to Nursery_E; B might apply if rejected elsewhere, but could be absorbed by other nurseries that rank B relatively well (A ranks B top, C ranks B 2nd). Given we already extended the waiting window and are at round 12 with no higher-priority approaches, the expected benefit of further waiting is low relative to the cost of remaining unmatched. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match and respects the earlier stated timeline (window now closed)."
