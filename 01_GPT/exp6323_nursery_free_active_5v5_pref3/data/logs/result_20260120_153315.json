Since we have quota 1, accepting now could block a higher-priority Parent_D or Parent_A who may apply later. Check likelihood: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C, then Nursery_A, then us (Nursery_B) as 3rd; so Parent_D might not come to us early. Parent_A ranks us 4th, so also unlikely to apply early. Parent_B lists us as 1st choice, so if we reject we likely lose them. Given only one current applicant and uncertainty that higher-priority parents will apply to us, but our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list; the optimal strategy is to hold out for Parent_D/Parent_A if possible. With no mechanism to 'hold' an application (must accept/reject), we reject Parent_B to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates."
