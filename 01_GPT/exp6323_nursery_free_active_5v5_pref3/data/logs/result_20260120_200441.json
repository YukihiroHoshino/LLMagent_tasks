Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 2nd and could apply, but may first pursue Nursery_B. Given I have an immediate, valid application from a relatively high-priority parent (3rd) and there is no guarantee higher-priority parents will apply before the process ends, accepting Parent_C now secures a strong match within quota 1."

However, Parent_C (my top choice) is likely to apply elsewhere first (they rank Nursery_C 4th), and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so neither is likely to apply soon. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to commit, making acceptance now a strong outcome and reduces risk of ending with a lower-ranked match or vacancy.
