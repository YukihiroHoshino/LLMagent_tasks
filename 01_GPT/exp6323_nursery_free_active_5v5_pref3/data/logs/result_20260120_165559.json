Given Parent_D ranks Nursery_C as their 1st choice, if I accept now I secure a reasonably high-priority match but forgo the chance to match with Parent_C/Parent_B if they apply later. Still, there is no guarantee Parent_C or Parent_B will ever apply to Nursery_C (they prefer Nursery_D/Nursery_B respectively), so holding the seat risks ending up with a lower-priority match or vacancy.

Parent_E also prefers Nursery_C/B/A before Nursery_D, so also unlikely to apply to us soon.

However, rejecting now risks losing a solid, committed applicant who has me as first choice, and I may end up unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply.
