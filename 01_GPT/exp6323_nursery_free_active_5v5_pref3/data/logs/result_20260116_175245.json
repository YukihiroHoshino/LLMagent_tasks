However, there is no guarantee they will apply, and accepting Parent_E now secures a filled seat with an acceptable (listed) parent. Given we already rejected a higher-ranked applicant (Parent_A), it is consistent to wait for B or D if we believe they are likely to become available, but that risks ending unmatched. With round 2 and only one current applicant, a cautious strategy is to reject now and keep capacity for B/D, who are plausibly still unmatched and may reach out soon."

Given Parent preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (may come if rejected by B/D), Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (likely to come if not matched to C), Parent_A ranks Nursery_A 1st but was rejected earlier; still could re-apply if unmatched. With quota 1 and no other messages this round, best strategy is to keep spot open and continue stalling via [TALK], setting a clear next check-in and reiterating we will request [APPLY] if we can proceed.

Also, Parent_E’s preferences place Nursery_A 3rd, so they may still be available later, whereas higher-priority parents might become available if rejected elsewhere.
