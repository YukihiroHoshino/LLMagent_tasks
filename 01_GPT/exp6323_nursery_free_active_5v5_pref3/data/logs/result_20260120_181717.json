Given the market info: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (likely to apply first to Nursery_B, then Nursery_D), and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (likely to apply first to Nursery_C). There is still a meaningful chance either could come to Nursery_A in subsequent rounds if rejected elsewhere. Since we can only respond with ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, the best strategy to maximize expected priority is to reject Parent_A now and wait for higher-priority parents."

In this round I have applications from Parent_D and Parent_E; Parent_D ranks higher than Parent_E, so if choosing between these two I should prefer Parent_D. However, both Parent_B and Parent_C rank above Parent_D, and I know Parent_B and Parent_C currently prefer other nurseries first (Parent_B: Nursery_B first; Parent_C: Nursery_D first), so they may not apply to me immediately. Given the one-shot accept/reject on an [APPLY], accepting Parent_D now would fill my only quota and prevent matching with higher-priority Parent_B/Parent_C if they later become available. Still, there is no guarantee Parent_B/Parent_C will ever apply to Nursery_C, while Parent_D has Nursery_C as first choice and is likely to commit. Balancing certainty vs. upside, and since Parent_D is still relatively high (3rd) and higher than Parent_E, I will accept Parent_D now to secure a good match rather than risk ending unmatched or with a lower-priority parent."

Given Parent_B ranks Nursery_B first, they are likely to accept immediately, but we can reject now and hope to attract a higher-priority candidate. Since only Parent_B applied this round and we have no obligation to fill immediately, we strategically reject to preserve the seat for Parent_D/Parent_A, who both rank Nursery_B reasonably high (both list Nursery_B as 3rd/4th choice) and may come if their top choices reject them."
