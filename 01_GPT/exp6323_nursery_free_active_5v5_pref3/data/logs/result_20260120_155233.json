However, Parent_C (my top choice) and Parent_B (my second choice) have not applied to me this round; they each rank Nursery_C 4th and 5th respectively, so they are unlikely to apply later unless rejected elsewhere. Still, accepting Parent_D now fills my only quota and forecloses the chance (however small) of matching with Parent_C or Parent_B in later rounds. Given Parent_D ranks Nursery_C as their 1st choice and is applying now, the risk of ending unmatched if I reject is nontrivial, while the probability of later receiving Parent_C/Parent_B is low.
