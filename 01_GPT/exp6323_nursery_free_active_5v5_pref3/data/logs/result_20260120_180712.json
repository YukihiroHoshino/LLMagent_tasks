Given Parent_D prefers Nursery_C/A/B (B is 3rd) and Parent_A ranks us 4th, there is a reasonable chance one of them may not secure their top options and may approach us in later rounds. To maximize our outcome, we should keep the seat open and reject Parent_B now."

Waiting for Parent_D or Parent_E is risky: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (Nursery_D is last), and Parent_E’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_B then Nursery_A (Nursery_D is 4th), so neither is likely to apply to Nursery_D early or at all.

Although Parent_A ranks us 1st and is applying now, accepting would immediately fill our only quota and prevent matching with Parent_B or Parent_D if they apply later. Given full information: Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_B (and Nursery_B ranks Parent_B 3rd), so Parent_B may not come to us; Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (and Nursery_C ranks Parent_D 3rd), so Parent_D may also not come to us. However, both could plausibly be rejected by their first choices and then apply to us (both list Nursery_A as 3rd and 2nd respectively). Since we only get one shot per round and cannot hold/wait with an [APPLY], the best strategy to maximize chance of a higher-priority match is to reject Parent_A now and keep capacity for Parent_B/Parent_D. Risk: we may end unmatched or later accept a lower-ranked parent, but our objective is to match as high as possible, not to guarantee a match."

However, Parent_C (my top choice) is likely to apply to Nursery_D first (their first choice), and Parent_B is unlikely to apply to me (I am their last choice).
