If, in the meantime (round 15), you receive an active application from any higher-priority family (Parent_A, Parent_C, or Parent_B) that would change the round 16 situation, I would be very grateful if you could let me know as soon as possible so I can plan accordingly.\n\nThank you again for your time and transparency.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Nursery_E has explicitly stated they will accept me if I apply in round 16 provided no higher-priority active application is in front of them. Since it is currently round 15, the best move is to keep the channel warm and confirm I will apply at the start of round 16, while also asking them to notify me immediately if a higher-priority application arrives so I can plan. I should not apply in round 15 because their stated procedure is round 16."

If we do receive an active application from any of those higher-priority families during round 15, we will let you know promptly, as you requested.\n\nOtherwise, please proceed with your **formal [APPLY] at the start of round 16**. Per the procedure we outlined: if, in round 16, we do not have an active application in front of us from Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B and the place is still open, we will accept your application in that round.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E",

No higher-priority parents have applied to us so far, but they could still become unmatched and apply later. We already offered a credible commitment: we will accept Parent_E in round 16 if no higher-priority active application is in front of us then. In round 15 Parent_E only sent [TALK], so we should reaffirm the plan, keep optionality for higher-priority applicants, and avoid any binding promise beyond the stated condition. Quota remains 1 and we are unmatched, so continuing with the agreed procedure maximizes chance of getting a higher-priority parent while preserving a fallback with Parent_E."
