Given only one round of info and no other applicants in inbox, rejecting risks ending unmatched if top priorities never apply, but market has 5 parents/5 nurseries so everyone likely matches.

We can accommodate your standard hours and are flexible on days/times as needed.\n\n3) Paperwork readiness: Confirmed—if offered a place, we can accept immediately and complete all enrollment paperwork the same day.\n\nIf helpful, we can also do a quick call/visit on short notice. Please let me know if there is anything else you need from us as you reach your decision in the next round or two.\n\nWarm regards,\nParent_E",

Since Parent_E is only [TALK] this round (not forcing an accept/reject) and our quota remains open, it is optimal to continue holding the spot briefly while keeping Parent_E warm and setting a clear next step and timeline.

Given we previously communicated a short decision window and have been consistently holding for higher-priority families, it is optimal to continue rejecting E for now to preserve the chance of matching higher on our list, even at the risk of remaining unmatched.
