However, Parent_C (our top choice) is not in the inbox and may be applying to Nursery_D first (their top preference), but could later come to us if rejected; Parent_B might also come later though we are their last choice. If we accept Parent_D now, we forgo the chance to accept Parent_C later. Given the market, Parent_C is likely to be accepted by Nursery_D (Nursery_D ranks Parent_C third), but Nursery_D may accept Parent_D or Parent_E first depending on who applies; Parent_D is Nursery_D’s top priority, so Parent_D might get Nursery_D if they apply there. Since Parent_D is applying to us as first choice and is our 3rd priority, accepting secures a reasonably high-priority match with low risk. Waiting is risky because we may end up with a lower-priority parent or unfilled seat if top candidates match elsewhere. Therefore accept Parent_D."
