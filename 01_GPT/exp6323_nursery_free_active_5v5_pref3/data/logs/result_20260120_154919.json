Parent_E has already applied twice and been rejected; they are now only talking and asking for a decision timeline. Accepting now would lock in a lower-priority match and prevent matching with Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B if they approach later. From parents’ preferences, Nursery_E is last choice for A, C, and E; 4th for B and D. So higher-priority parents (A/C/B) are unlikely to come, but still possible if they get rejected elsewhere. Since it’s only round 6 of 30, it’s rational to keep the spot open longer, while giving Parent_E a clear checkpoint to avoid endless delay. Continue TALK, set a concrete review round (e.g., round 12) and invite them to check back or apply then."
