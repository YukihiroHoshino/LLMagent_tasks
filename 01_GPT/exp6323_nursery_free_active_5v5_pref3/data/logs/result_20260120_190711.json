With quota 1 and early round 1, it is strategically better to wait for higher-priority candidates rather than commit to Parent_B now.

However, Parent_C (our top choice) is likely to apply to Nursery_D first (their #1), and Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_B first; both could become unavailable, but there remains a chance that Parent_C or Parent_B could be rejected elsewhere and later apply to us (Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so this is less likely). Parent_D ranks Nursery_C as #1 and is ready to commit, making an immediate secure match attractive. Since we can only accept one and prefer higher-ranked parents, accepting Parent_D now is reasonable given the uncertainty of getting Parent_C/Parent_B later and the fact we already rejected Parent_E previously.

In the overall market, Parent_E lists Nursery_E last, suggesting they will accept if no better options remain, so we can likely keep them available without committing. No other parents contacted Nursery_E this round, but it is still early (round 6/30), and higher-priority parents may become unmatched and reach out later. Given prior rejections and our stated plan to review over the next few rounds, the optimal move is to reject again to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates."
