Parent_E has applied repeatedly and is ready to accept immediately, but accepting now would lock us in and prevent matching with higher-priority parents (Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B) if they later approach. Given the game horizon (up to round 30) and that higher-priority parents currently rank Nursery_E last (A,C) or 4th (B), they are unlikely but still possible if rejected elsewhere. Since we still have time and no cost to waiting besides risking ending unmatched, the strategy to maximize chance of a higher-priority match is to continue rejecting Parent_E for now while keeping communication polite. Parent_E asked whether higher-priority families are actively applying this round; from our inbox, only Parent_E contacted us, so we can truthfully say we have no active higher-priority application this round, but we must still keep the spot open pending the broader process."
