However, Parent_C (my top choice) is likely applying to Nursery_D first, and Parent_B is likely applying to Nursery_B first, so they may not approach me later; still, accepting Parent_D now locks my only seat and prevents upgrading if a higher-priority parent applies in a later round. Given the rules do not allow holding/waitlisting on an [APPLY] and require accept/reject, and given Parent_D has Nursery_C as first choice and is a strong (3rd) priority, I will accept to secure a good match rather than risk ending with lower priority or unfilled."
