Parent_E ranks 4th on our list and is acceptable. However, higher-priority parents (Parent_C, Parent_B) have not yet applied; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they are unlikely to apply early, but could if rejected elsewhere.

Also, Parent_D is actively applying and can commit immediately. To maximize expected outcome, we can continue holding for a bit longer, but we must avoid reaching late rounds with no match. At round 16, still enough time; but Parent_D may give up. Still, since objective is highest possible on priority list, we should reject while keeping door open, maintaining consistency with prior stance and encouraging higher-priority parents to apply.

I can confirm acceptance the same day and complete all required paperwork right away (and I can be flexible on start date).\n\nThank you for your continued consideration.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_D",

              "thought": "Parent_D is last on Nursery_E’s true priority list. Nursery_E prefers leaving the spot unfilled over accepting anyone not on the list, but Parent_D is on the list (albeit lowest). However, given the full market information, higher-priority candidates for Nursery_E (Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_B, Parent_E) all rank Nursery_E last and have strong incentives to match elsewhere; historically, none has approached Nursery_E through Round 26, while Parent_D has repeatedly applied and can commit immediately. With only 4 rounds remaining, continuing to hold out is very unlikely to produce a higher-priority match and risks ending unmatched. Therefore, accept Parent_D now to secure a match within quota."
