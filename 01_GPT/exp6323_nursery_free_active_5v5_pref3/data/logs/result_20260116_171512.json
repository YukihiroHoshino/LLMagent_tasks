I have already rejected Parent_A twice, which risks losing them to other nurseries (Parent_A’s next choice is Nursery_C, where they are lowest priority; then Nursery_D where they are lowest; Nursery_B where they are 2nd; so Parent_A could plausibly end up at Nursery_B if they apply there).

As you advised, since Nursery_E is still unmatched in round 15, I would like to submit a fresh formal [APPLY] for the available place.\n\nI understand your decision this round depends on whether any higher-priority families have active/viable applications. If you are able to extend an offer to us in round 15, we are ready to accept immediately and can complete all paperwork and onboarding steps right away. We remain fully flexible on start date and arrangements.\n\nThank you very much for reconsidering our application this round.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Nursery_E explicitly advised that the most meaningful step is to submit a fresh formal application in round 15, at which point they will reassess based on whether any higher-priority families have active/viable applications. Therefore I will follow their process and submit a clear [APPLY], reiterating immediate acceptance and full flexibility to make it easy to offer if their higher-priority options are not viable this round."

              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority is A > C > B > E > D. The only applicant this round is Parent_E, who is 4th on our list. Accepting now would lock us in and prevent matching with higher-priority Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B if they later apply. Given we are already at round 15 (the reconsideration point we communicated), we should reassess whether those higher-priority parents have incentives to approach us: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last. So it is unlikely top priorities A or C will ever apply, and B might only if rejected elsewhere. With no other applications in hand and continued vacancy risk, accepting Parent_E now secures a match rather than remaining empty. This improves outcome versus leaving seat unfilled through late rounds. Therefore accept Parent_E."
