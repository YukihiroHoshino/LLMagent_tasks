Since we cannot hold/wait under an [APPLY] without deciding, the strategic choice is to reject now to preserve the seat for a potentially higher-priority parent, accepting the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked parent or unfilled.

No other applicants this round, but future rounds likely bring Parent_B/Parent_D given their preference orderings and competition at their top choices (Parent_B prefers Nursery_B first; Parent_D prefers Nursery_C first).

Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they may not apply early, but it is still possible if they are rejected elsewhere. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is likely to commit; also Nursery_D and Nursery_B rank Parent_D highly, so delaying could risk losing Parent_D.

Therefore I should reject Parent_E to preserve the spot for Parent_B."

In the current inbox, Parent_B and Parent_E applied. Parent_B is Nursery_A’s top priority overall, while Parent_E is lower. Accepting Parent_B immediately secures the best attainable match; holding out for Parent_D is risky because Parent_D’s first choice is Nursery_C (then Nursery_A) and they may match elsewhere before approaching. Given Parent_B’s stated willingness to accept immediately and our objective to maximize priority rank, we should accept Parent_B now and finalize the match."
