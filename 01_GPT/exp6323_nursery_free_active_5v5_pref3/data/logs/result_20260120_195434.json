However, I should consider whether holding out could secure Parent_C or Parent_B. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (likely to apply to Nursery_D/A/B first), and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last (unlikely to apply). Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is applying now, making them a strong, reliable match. Parent_E also ranks Nursery_C 1st, but is lower in my priority.

Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th but Nursery_E ranks D last. Parent_E has repeatedly demonstrated strong commitment, immediate start, and is applying now. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched by round 30, which is worse than accepting a mid-ranked but acceptable parent within the list. Therefore accept Parent_E now to secure a match."
