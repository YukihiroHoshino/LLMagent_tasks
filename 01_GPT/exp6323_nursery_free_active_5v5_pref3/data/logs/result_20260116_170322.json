Parent_B’s preferences rank Nursery_A 3rd (after Nursery_B and Nursery_D), so they are unlikely to approach unless rejected elsewhere. Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (after Nursery_C) and could plausibly approach later. Since it’s only round 12 of 30, holding the seat preserves the chance to match with Parent_B or Parent_D; accepting Parent_E now would lock in a worse outcome. Parent_E is currently sending [TALK], so respond with [TALK] and give a concrete checkpoint to manage expectations while keeping flexibility."

Current inbox only has Parent_E with a [TALK], so no immediate opportunity to accept a higher-priority parent this round. To maximize chance of a better match while managing Parent_E’s deadline (end of Round 14), we should keep the spot uncommitted through Round 13 and give a clear, credible checkpoint: if no higher-priority acceptance by end of Round 14, we will be ready to move forward with Parent_E promptly (invite them to submit [APPLY] in Round 14)."
