Parent_B ranks me 1st, so accepting now secures a solid match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched, but it forgoes the possibility of a higher-priority parent later. With only one message in my inbox this round and no guarantee that D or A will ever apply to me, the safe strategy to maximize expected outcome is to accept Parent_B now rather than hold out and risk losing a sure acceptable candidate."

However, Parent_D is Nursery_D’s top choice and Parent_E is second; both currently prefer other nurseries first (Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_E ranks Nursery_D fourth), so they are unlikely to apply to Nursery_D early, but could later if rejected elsewhere.
