Parent_D’s preferences are C > A > B, so B is only their 3rd choice; they will likely apply to Nursery_C and Nursery_A first. Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_C first, then Parent_B, then Parent_D; Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_B then Parent_D. This makes Parent_D’s path uncertain but they still may not reach B.

We can offer you our remaining place for this intake. Please reply to confirm acceptance and we will send the enrollment packet and propose an intake meeting time within the next 1–2 days. We look forward to welcoming your family.",
              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority is A > C > B > E > D. Parent_E is 4th, and we have already rejected them twice. However, by round 6 we are still unmatched with 1 open seat, and Parent_E is the only applicant in the inbox this round. Given the market information, Parent_A/C/B all rank Nursery_E last and are likely matched elsewhere; waiting risks ending unmatched. Since Parent_E is on our acceptable list and can start immediately with flexible hours, accepting now secures a match rather than leaving the place unfilled."
