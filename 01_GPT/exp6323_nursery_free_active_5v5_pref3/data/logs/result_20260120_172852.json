Between them, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, so if I must choose now, Parent_D is the better match. Although Parent_C and Parent_B are higher priorities, neither has applied to me this round and they each rank Nursery_C low (Parent_C has C as 4th; Parent_B has C as 5th), making it unlikely they will apply soon.

I have repeatedly applied and been rejected because they are reserving for higher-priority families, but with the market at round 25 and the seat still unfilled, the best chance to secure any match is to re-apply with a clear, immediate-commitment offer and a simple request to be accepted if they are ready to finalize now. I will keep the tone respectful and concise, emphasizing immediate confirmation and paperwork, without over-pressuring."

              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_A’s true priority list (behind Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A). Parent_A already applied earlier and was rejected; Parent_E has repeatedly applied and we have consistently rejected to hold for higher-priority families. In the current round 25 inbox, only Parent_E applied; no higher-priority parent is currently applying to us. However, Parent_B (our top) ranks Nursery_A 3rd and may apply later after trying Nursery_B/Nursery_D; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd and may also apply later after Nursery_C. With 5 rounds remaining, there is still a realistic chance a higher-priority family applies. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list and we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting outside the list (Parent_E is on the list), we can still rationally continue to wait. Therefore reject again this round to preserve the possibility of matching with Parent_B/Parent_D/Parent_A if they come forward."

Check whether higher-priority families are likely to apply: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after B, D); Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (after C); Parent_A ranked Nursery_A 1st but was already rejected and likely moved on; Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 2nd (after D) but is lowest priority anyway. With only 4 rounds left (26/30) and no higher-priority applicants in the inbox for many rounds, the risk of ending unmatched is increasing. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match, and E is still on our acceptable list. Therefore accept."
