It is plausible Parent_D may come to Nursery_A if rejected by Nursery_C, and Parent_B may come if rejected by Nursery_B.

However, Parent_C (our top choice) is likely to apply elsewhere first (prefers Nursery_D then A then B then C), and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so neither is likely to apply to us soon.
