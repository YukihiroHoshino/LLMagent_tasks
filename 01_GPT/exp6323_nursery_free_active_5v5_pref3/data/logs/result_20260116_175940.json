While Parent_C (my top choice) is not currently in my inbox, Parent_C’s preferences rank Nursery_C only 4th, so they are unlikely to apply soon (they will likely try Nursery_D, Nursery_A, then Nursery_B first). Parent_B also ranks Nursery_C last, so also unlikely to apply. Given quota=1 and a strong, credible first-choice application from Parent_D, the risk of holding out for a higher-priority parent is high and could leave the seat unfilled or force acceptance of a lower-ranked parent later.

There is a reasonable chance Parent_D may not reach us if accepted by Nursery_C/A, but also a chance they later apply to us. However, rejecting Parent_B risks ending with a worse match or none if higher-priority parents never apply. Since we can only respond once and an [APPLY] requires accept/reject, the safer strategy to secure a relatively high-priority parent is to accept Parent_B now."
