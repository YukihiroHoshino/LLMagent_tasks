We still have quota 1 and no other parents contacted us this round, but accepting E now would foreclose the chance to match with higher-priority Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B if they approach later. Given Parent_E’s repeated APPLY attempts and our repeated rejections, we should maintain flexibility and keep the conversation open without committing. Respond with TALK, explaining we are still awaiting potential higher-priority interest and asking for any key info that could matter if we later need to decide quickly."

As requested, here are my details:\n\n1) Earliest start date: I can start immediately (as early as next working day), or on any date you specify.\n2) Days/hours needed: I am flexible and can align to your standard schedule. If helpful for planning, we can do full-time Mon–Fri, and I can also accommodate shorter or staggered hours during the settling-in period.\n3) Trial/settling-in period: Yes, I’m fully open to your standard trial/settling-in arrangement and can follow your preferred structure.\n\nI would like to formally apply again and confirm that if you offer me the place, I will accept immediately and complete all paperwork the same day. If there is any specific format you’d like for confirming hours/start date, please let me know and I will send it right away.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

We will then send the enrollment paperwork the same day.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_E’s true priority list (A, C, B, E, D). We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. However, higher-priority parents (A/C/B) all rank Nursery_E last, so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere late in the process. Parent_E has repeatedly applied, confirmed immediate start, flexibility, and willingness to complete paperwork same day—high certainty of filling the seat. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched if no higher-priority family approaches. Given round 7/30 and no other inbox candidates, accepting Parent_E now maximizes expected outcome versus continued delay."
