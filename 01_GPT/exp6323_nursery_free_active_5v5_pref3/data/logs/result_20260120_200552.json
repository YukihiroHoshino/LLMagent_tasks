Parent_E ranks us 2nd and might apply, but is our lowest priority. Therefore, Parent_B is a strong, likely-secure match and also values us most, reducing risk.

Parent_E is applying repeatedly and is willing to accept immediately, but accepting now would block me from matching with any higher-priority parent who may still become unmatched and apply later in the process. Given the market information, Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last, so they likely come only after being rejected elsewhere; similarly, higher-priority parents (A/C/B) may also turn to Nursery_E later if they fail to secure preferred nurseries. Since we are only at round 7 of 30, it is strategically better to keep the seat open rather than lock in a lower-priority match now.

Concretely, if we reach **round 12** and we still have not received an eligible [APPLY] from a higher-priority family (Parent_A/Parent_C/Parent_B), we will consider making an offer to the next available applicant at that time.\n\nIf you’d like, you can either (a) check back at round 12, or (b) send an [APPLY] at/after round 12 and we can make a formal decision immediately then.
