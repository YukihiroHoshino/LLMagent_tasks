However, I should consider whether I can realistically attract Parent_C or Parent_B if I wait. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C as 4th (after D, A, B), so unlikely to apply early and may match elsewhere; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, very unlikely to apply at all. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to confirm, making this a strong, reliable match. If I reject now to hold out for Parent_C/B, I risk ending up with a worse match or unfilled.

At this moment, it’s not a matter of paperwork, deposit timing, start date, or schedule flexibility—those items are all workable. The constraint is that we must finalize our place in line with our admissions priority order and we are still assessing whether higher-priority families may take the remaining spot.\n\nTo advise you realistically: if you would like to remain under consideration, please confirm (1) the latest date by which you need a firm decision, and (2) your preferred start date window. If we reach a point where we can make an offer to you, we would be able to move quickly.\n\nThank you again for your patience.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_A Admissions",

Parent_E’s current message is [TALK], so no binding decision is required. Best strategy is to keep Parent_E engaged without committing, while signaling that any offer depends on higher-priority demand and asking for a concrete timeline so we can decide if we must fill the seat."
