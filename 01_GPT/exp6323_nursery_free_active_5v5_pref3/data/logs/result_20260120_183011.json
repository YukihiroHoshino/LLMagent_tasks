However, I have quota 1 and would like to avoid committing too early if there is a reasonable chance to match with Parent_C or Parent_B, who rank above Parent_D. Parent_C’s top choice is Nursery_D (then A, B, C), so they may not approach me early; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, so unlikely to apply. Parent_A ranks me second and Parent_E/D rank me first. Waiting could risk losing Parent_D, but accepting now guarantees a relatively high match (3rd on my list) and Parent_D is very eager. Given the environment where parents apply to one nursery per round, securing Parent_D now is safer than holding out for Parent_C who is likely to pursue Nursery_D and may never reach me.

With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now would prevent upgrading later. Given our objective to match as high as possible on our priority list and the likelihood that Parent_C will remain available if we delay (since we are Parent_C’s 1st choice), it is strategically better to reject now to keep the seat open for a potential higher-priority parent in subsequent rounds."

Parent_B ranks me 1st and is applying now, which is a strong signal and could secure my seat. However, accepting now blocks any chance of upgrading to Parent_D (my top choice).
