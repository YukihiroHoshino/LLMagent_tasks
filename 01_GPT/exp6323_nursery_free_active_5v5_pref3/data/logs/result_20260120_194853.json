We’re not able to provide a bespoke breakdown of criteria (e.g., sibling/catchment/age-band weighting) within this chat beyond what is shown/defined by the platform for the relevant vacancy, as those details are set by the listing/rules for that specific intake.\n\nOn timeline: once a new vacancy is posted, applications are typically reviewed within the platform’s active rounds for that cycle, and offers (if any) are made through the standard [APPLY] → [ACCEPT] process during those rounds. The most reliable approach is to submit promptly when a new Nursery_E vacancy appears and to follow any deadlines/round cutoffs shown on the platform posting.\n\nAs noted previously, this does not reopen anything for the current intake, and we won’t be progressing further applications this cycle.\n\nWith best wishes,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
