However, Parent_C (my top choice) and Parent_B (second) have not applied yet; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th and Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th, so they are unlikely to approach me early, while Parent_D ranks me 1st and is applying now. Given the one-shot accept/reject on an [APPLY] and quota 1, accepting Parent_D secures a relatively high-ranked candidate and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked match (or none) if I reject and my top choices never apply."

Accepting Parent_B now would fill our only seat and foreclose the chance to match with Parent_D or Parent_A if they become available later.
