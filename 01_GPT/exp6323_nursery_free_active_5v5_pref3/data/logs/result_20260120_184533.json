Check parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 3rd (after Nursery_C and Nursery_A), so they may try C then A first; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th, also unlikely to come early. However, rejecting now risks losing a solid first-choice applicant (Parent_B ranks us #1) and ending up with an even lower priority later.

However, Parent_D (my top choice) prefers Nursery_C first and ranks Nursery_D last, so they are unlikely to apply to me early (or at all). Parent_E also prefers Nursery_C/B/A before D, so also unlikely. Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 2nd and may apply later, but Parent_C is above Parent_B in my priority.
