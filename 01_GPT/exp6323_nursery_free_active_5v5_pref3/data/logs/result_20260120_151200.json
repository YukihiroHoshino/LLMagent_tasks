However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th and likely prefers B/D/A; they may have been rejected elsewhere. Higher-priority candidates for us are Parent_A and Parent_C. Parent_A ranks us last, so unlikely to apply; Parent_C ranks us last as well, also unlikely. Parent_E ranks us last too; Parent_D ranks us 4th.
