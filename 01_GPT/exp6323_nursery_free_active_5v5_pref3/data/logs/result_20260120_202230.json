However, Parent_D (our top choice) ranks Nursery_D last, so is unlikely to apply; Parent_E ranks us 4th, also unlikely early. Parent_B ranks us 2nd and Parent_A ranks us 3rd, so there is some chance higher-priority candidates (Parent_E is higher than C but unlikely; Parent_B is lower than C) may apply later. Given limited rounds but early stage, the risk of waiting is moderate; yet accepting Parent_C secures a high-priority (3rd) match with strong commitment.

Given we still have time (Round 15 of 30) and have repeatedly communicated that we are proceeding by priority, we should continue to reject Parent_E to preserve the option value of a higher-priority match, even if that risks remaining unmatched."
