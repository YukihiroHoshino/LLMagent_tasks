Given quota 1 and the risk of ending unmatched if I wait for unlikely higher-priority applicants, accepting Parent_D now maximizes expected outcome compared to rejecting and hoping for Parent_C/B.

Given the market info, Nursery_E is last choice for Parents A/C and also last for Parent_B, so the probability of them applying is low but not zero as other nurseries fill. With rounds remaining, it is strategically better to continue holding the seat to preserve the chance of a higher-priority match, consistent with our earlier stance. Therefore, reject Parent_E again while keeping tone respectful and noting we may reconsider if circumstances change."

Check parents’ preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last. So higher-priority candidates are unlikely but not impossible to approach if they exhaust other options. Given repeated applications from Parent_E and no other inbound messages this round, best strategy is to keep conversation open without committing, maintaining ability to accept higher-priority if they appear. Parent_E asked about active conversations/expected applies; be transparent: none currently, no commitments, but cannot set a firm deadline; can offer a conditional timeline for reconsideration (e.g., if still unfilled after a few more rounds) while not violating rules.
