However, higher-priority parents (A/C/B) may still become unmatched later and could apply; accepting Parent_E now would prevent matching with a higher-priority parent. Parent_E has not sent an [APPLY] this round, only [TALK], so we should keep the option open while maintaining the previously stated commitment to decide by end of round 7. We can request basic documentation now to be ready if we proceed, without committing early."

Thank you again for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

We will then send the enrollment/registration forms and a short checklist of documents to finalize the placement.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming your family.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions",

We have held the seat through the end of round 7 to see if any higher-priority parents (A/C/B) would approach us. In this round, only Parent_E applied; no higher-priority candidates are in the inbox. Given the round-7 commitment we communicated, the risk of continuing to wait is ending the simulation unmatched, while accepting Parent_E yields a filled seat with an acceptable (listed) parent. Also, Parent_E has indicated immediate commitment and readiness to complete paperwork, reducing execution risk. Therefore, accept Parent_E now."
