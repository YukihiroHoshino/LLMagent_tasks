Parent_C ranks us first, making acceptance likely to finalize a match now. Waiting could, in theory, allow a higher-priority parent (D or E) to apply later, but given their preferences, that is improbable.

Given Parent_B lists Nursery_B as their 1st choice, accepting would lock in a decent match, but it may block the chance to match with Parent_D (our top choice) or Parent_A (2nd) if they later apply. Check likely flows: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C, then Nursery_A, then Nursery_B; so Parent_D may not come to us unless rejected by C and A. Nursery_C’s top priority is Parent_C, so Parent_D might be rejected there; Nursery_A’s top priorities are Parent_B then Parent_D, so Parent_D could be accepted by Nursery_A if they apply there and capacity allows. Parent_A’s preferences put Nursery_B as 4th, so they are unlikely to apply early. Therefore, the probability of receiving Parent_D or Parent_A soon is uncertain and possibly low. With quota 1 and only one applicant now, accepting Parent_B secures a high-quality match (rank 3) with strong commitment. I will accept."
