From preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after B, D) so may come if rejected elsewhere; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (after C) so is a significant threat to arrive later; Parent_A already applied and was rejected but could re-apply if still unmatched. Given we still have quota 1 and only a TALK from E, we should not commit. We also should avoid revealing specific statuses; respond in general terms, keep E engaged, and possibly set a soft reassessment horizon without promising. Best action: [TALK]."

If you are able to offer us the place, we are ready to accept immediately and complete all paperwork the same day. To make this easy on your side, we can also confirm within 24 hours of an offer (or faster if you prefer) and we’re fully flexible on start date and settling-in arrangements.\n\nI understand you must follow your priority order. If no higher-priority family comes forward to apply/confirm this round, I would be very grateful to be considered so you can fill the place without further delay.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

              "thought": "Nursery_A has quota 1 and remains unmatched. Our true priority order is B > D > A > E > C, so Parent_E is 4th. We previously rejected Parent_A (3rd) to hold out for higher-priority Parent_B or Parent_D (top two), who have not contacted us at all through round 16. Given parents’ preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (behind B and D) and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (behind C). It is plausible they may still approach if rejected elsewhere, but with many rounds elapsed and no contact, the probability is decreasing. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched by round 30, which is worse than accepting Parent_E (who is on our list and repeatedly ready to accept immediately). Since Parent_E is a valid priority candidate and offers immediate confirmation, and there is no competing applicant in the inbox this round, it is now optimal to fill the seat with Parent_E rather than gamble further on uncertain higher-priority arrivals."
