Given full information: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (after Nursery_B, Nursery_D) so may not apply immediately; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (after Nursery_C) and may apply if Nursery_C doesn’t work out. Since only Parent_A contacted us this round, the strategic choice is to reject now to preserve the seat for higher-priority parents, accepting the risk of ending unmatched if they never apply. Because we prefer any listed parent to being unfilled, but we can wait at least one round to see if Parent_B/Parent_D approach."

Nursery_C’s priority list ranks me (Parent_E) ahead of Parent_A, and only behind Parent_C, Parent_B, and Parent_D.

Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E on my list, and both state Nursery_C is their first choice and are ready to commit. Accepting Parent_E now would block a better-ranked candidate (Parent_D) immediately, and there is also a possibility that even higher-ranked parents (Parent_C or Parent_B) may approach in later rounds.

Current inbox has Parent_D and Parent_E applying; Parent_D is higher than Parent_E, so if choosing between them now, Parent_D is preferable. However, accepting Parent_D immediately would fill my only quota and could block a higher-priority match with Parent_C or Parent_B if they apply in a later round. Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (likely to apply to Nursery_D/A/B first), Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last (unlikely to apply), so the chance of receiving an application from Parent_C or Parent_B soon is relatively low. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and is ready to commit, giving high certainty of filling the seat with a mid-high priority candidate. Given the trade-off between certainty and waiting for unlikely higher-priority applicants, accept Parent_D now."

However, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last, so is very unlikely to apply. Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 4th, so may apply later if rejected elsewhere; but there is no guarantee. Accepting Parent_C now secures a reasonably high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for Parent_E.

Waiting for Parent_D or Parent_A is risky: Parent_D’s top choice is Nursery_C (then Nursery_A, then Nursery_B), and Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 4th, so neither is likely to apply to us early. With quota 1, accepting Parent_B now secures a solid match rather than gambling on higher-priority parents who may never approach us."
