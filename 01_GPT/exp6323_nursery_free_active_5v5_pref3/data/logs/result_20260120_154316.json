Parent_E’s preferences rank Nursery_D 4th (C, B, A, D, E), so also unlikely to apply soon. Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 2nd, but Parent_B is lower priority than Parent_C for us.

Keep the message short and compliant."

              "thought": "Nursery_A’s true priority order is B > D > A > E > C. Parent_E ranks 4th, so we should only accept if it’s unlikely we can secure B, D, or A by continuing to wait. From the full market preferences: Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 3rd (likely to pursue B then D first), Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 2nd (but prefers C first), Parent_A already applied to us earlier and we rejected (they may move on), and Parent_C ranks us 2nd but is lowest priority for us. In this round, only Parent_E applied to us; no higher-priority parent is currently engaging us. With round 25/30 approaching, continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with Parent_E (who is on our list and ready to confirm). Therefore accept Parent_E now to secure a match rather than risk leaving the place empty."
