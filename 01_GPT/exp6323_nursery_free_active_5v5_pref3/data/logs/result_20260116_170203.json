However, Parent_D (our #1) is unlikely to apply to us because they rank Nursery_D last, and Parent_E ranks us 4th, so the probability of receiving an application from either higher-priority parent is low. Given quota=1 and that holding out risks ending with a lower-priority applicant (Parent_B/#4 or Parent_A/#5) or remaining unmatched, accepting Parent_C now maximizes expected outcome under our priorities."

In this round I received applications from Parent_D and Parent_E; among these, Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E. However, Parent_C (my top choice) and Parent_B (second) have not applied yet. Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), while Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 5th (very unlikely to apply). Parent_A ranks Nursery_C 2nd and Parent_D/Parent_E rank Nursery_C 1st. Given quota 1, accepting Parent_D now would secure a relatively high-ranked match (3rd) and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked option if Parent_C/B never apply. Since Parent_D is strongly committed and top-chooses Nursery_C, the probability of a stable match is high. I will accept Parent_D and forego waiting for unlikely higher-priority applicants."
