Since quota is 1 and it is only round 1, accepting Parent_C now could block a higher-priority match if Parent_D or Parent_E later apply. Parent_D’s top choices are Nursery_C then Nursery_A, with Nursery_D last, so they are unlikely to apply early (or at all). Parent_E also prefers Nursery_C/B/A before Nursery_D, so also not likely to apply early. However, both could be rejected elsewhere and come to Nursery_D later; to preserve the chance to match higher on my list, I should reject Parent_C now rather than commit immediately. This is consistent with my objective to match as high as possible on my priority list."

Between these two, Parent_D is higher priority than Parent_E, but both are below Parent_B and Parent_C. I should avoid committing too early if there is a reasonable chance to attract Parent_C or Parent_B. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 4th, so they are unlikely to apply early; Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, very unlikely. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 1st and will likely commit elsewhere only if rejected. To keep the option open for a higher-priority parent while not immediately losing Parent_D, I would prefer to 'hold' Parent_D, but the protocol requires ACCEPT or REJECT for APPLY. Given low likelihood of getting Parent_B/Parent_C and Parent_D being a strong, immediate match (and above Parent_E), accept Parent_D now to secure a decent outcome."

Check Parent_D’s preferences: they rank Nursery_D last, so it is unlikely they will apply to us unless rejected everywhere else.
