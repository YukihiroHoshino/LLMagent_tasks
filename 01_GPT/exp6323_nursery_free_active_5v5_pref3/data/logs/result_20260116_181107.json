Parent_D’s preferences place Nursery_D last, so Parent_D is unlikely to apply. Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 4th and may or may not apply depending on outcomes at Nursery_C/B/A. Given Parent_C has Nursery_D as first choice and is likely to commit, accepting secures a solid match and reduces risk of ending unmatched if Parent_E never applies. Therefore accept Parent_C."

However, accepting Parent_E now would preclude matching with any higher-priority parent if they were to apply/ become available; throughout the history we have repeatedly stated we are still awaiting outcomes from higher-priority families and have consistently rejected Parent_E’s applications. Given no new information that those higher-priority options are unavailable, and to stay consistent with our priority strategy (maximize chance of A/C/B), we should reject the application again rather than lock in a lower-ranked match at the final moment."
