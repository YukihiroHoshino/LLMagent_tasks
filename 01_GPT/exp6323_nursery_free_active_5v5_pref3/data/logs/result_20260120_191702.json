Check likelihood they will apply to us: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th. So only Parent_B has a plausible path to us, but even then Parent_B prefers B, D, A first and would likely match elsewhere if seats exist. Given we are already at round 18 with the seat unfilled and no other applicants this round, the expected value of continuing to hold out for A/C/B is low, while accepting Parent_E yields a filled seat with an acceptable (listed) parent. Parent_E has repeatedly applied and will accept immediately, reducing risk. Therefore accept now to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched by round 30."
