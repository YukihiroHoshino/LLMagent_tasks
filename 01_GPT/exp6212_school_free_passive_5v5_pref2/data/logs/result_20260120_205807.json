Once a student applies, we respond promptly within the round structure; if we accept and you accept us, that match becomes final.\n\nWhat I’d love you to highlight about your background (so we can better understand fit):\n1) Which academic areas you most want to push further at School_B (and what kind of learning you enjoy—discussion, problem sets, projects, etc.).\n2) One or two sustained activities/commitments you’re proud of, and what your role/impact has been.\n3) Any context that shows resilience or growth (a challenge you overcame, a skill you built over time, or feedback you acted on).\n\nIf School_B is genuinely near the top of your list, I’d encourage you to consider applying when you’re ready—your continued interest matters, and we do take it seriously. What are the top 2 factors that will decide between your leading schools right now?",
