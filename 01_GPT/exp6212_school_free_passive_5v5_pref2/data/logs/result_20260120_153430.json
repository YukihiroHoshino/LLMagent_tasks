I can’t promise what Student_B or Student_D will do in the next round (students’ choices can shift quickly), but I can share our reality: with a single seat, we have to move as soon as we receive a strong application.\n\nRight now, the seat is still open, and you remain a serious candidate for us. If School_A is genuinely one of your top options, the safest strategy is to submit your application next round rather than waiting—because if a higher-priority student applies before then, we may need to act immediately.\n\nTo advise you more concretely: if you applied next round, would School_A be (a) your first choice, (b) top 2, or (c) top 3+? And are you prepared to commit quickly if we move forward?",

We cannot reliably predict others’ actions, but we can share that we are still evaluating and that timing matters. Encourage Student_A to apply next round if School_A is truly a top choice, and ask for their commitment level/timeline to decide whether to hold consideration for them."
