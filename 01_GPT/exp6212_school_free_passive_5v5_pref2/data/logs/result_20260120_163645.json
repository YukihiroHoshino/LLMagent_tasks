I’m ready to move forward formally because I believe I’d thrive in your community and contribute consistently both academically and as a supportive peer. I’m especially drawn to a school culture that values responsibility, steady effort, and positive community contribution, and that’s how I try to show up day to day. If accepted, I’m prepared to commit and would be excited to join School_E this year.",
              "thought": "School_E is my 3rd choice (after D and C). Only School_D and School_E remain unmatched this round, so I likely need to secure one now. School_E’s priority list ranks me last, so I’m unlikely to be accepted if higher-priority students apply. However, those students’ top choices suggest some may already be placed elsewhere; still, with only one seat, waiting risks ending unmatched if School_D fills. Given the late stage and limited options, I should apply to School_E now to lock in a chance rather than just talk again."

Remaining unmatched students are B and C; B is ranked #2 for School_E and also prefers School_E first, so there is a strong chance we can match with B.

              "thought": "Student_B is last on School_D’s true priority list but still acceptable.
