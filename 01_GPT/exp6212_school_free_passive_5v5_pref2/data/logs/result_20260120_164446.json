After reviewing our current seat availability and priorities for this cycle, we’re not able to move forward with an offer to you at this time. I genuinely appreciate the care you’ve taken in learning about our community, and I encourage you to pursue the schools where you’ll have the best overall fit and opportunity. Wishing you the very best in the rest of the process.",

With quota 1 and other unmatched students including Student_B (ranked #2 for us) and Student_E (ranked #4), it is better to hold the seat for a higher-priority applicant. Student_B has us as 4th choice but may become available depending on outcomes with their higher choices. Accepting Student_D now would block a better match, so we should reject while being respectful."

I already applied to School_C and School_A earlier; neither is currently available (School_A is still unmatched but I already applied, and this round I’m paired with School_B). Remaining unmatched schools are A and B, so securing B may be better than risking no match if A fills with a higher-priority student. I have only talked to B so far, so I can still apply now. School_B’s priority ranks me 4th (A, B, C, E, D), so I have a decent chance if top students go elsewhere. I should apply and signal commitment."

With quota 1 and only Student_D and Student_E remaining unmatched, and having already rejected Student_D (lowest priority), accepting Student_E secures a preferred match and avoids ending unfilled. Student_E is also indicating commitment, reducing risk of later withdrawal."
