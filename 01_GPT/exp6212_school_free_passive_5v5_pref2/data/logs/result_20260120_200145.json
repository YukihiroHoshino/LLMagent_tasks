We value “I built/led/improved X, measured by Y,” more than titles alone.\n3) Community reliability: being the person others can count on—peer support, collaboration, mentoring, or service that’s continuous and specific.\n\nOne concrete way to demonstrate alignment in this process:\n- Share a brief “School_D plan” (3–5 sentences) that links (a) your strongest academic interest, (b) one initiative you’d pursue here in the first semester, and (c) how it benefits classmates/community. If you can, include one concrete example from your past that proves you follow through (result/impact).\n\nIf you tell me your top academic interest and one activity/project you’ve taken real ownership of, I can suggest the most convincing way to frame that plan for School_D.",
