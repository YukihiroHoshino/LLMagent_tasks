Students who like “show your thinking” tend to love it here.\n- **Clubs/activities**: student-driven. The most rewarding experiences usually come from teams where students take real ownership—running events, building a product, competing, publishing work, or doing sustained service.\n- **Peer culture**: collaborative but ambitious—students share notes, workshop essays/projects together, and also push each other.\n\n**Strengths/experiences to highlight if you apply**\nIf you apply to School_B, it helps to highlight:\n- A concrete example of **sustained commitment** (months/years) and what you improved over time.\n- A moment where you **used feedback** to get better (revision story).\n- A situation where you **led or supported others** (mentoring, team role, organizing).\n- Any evidence of **self-starting** (starting a club, independent study, personal project, community initiative).\n\nTo tailor guidance: what are 1–2 activities you’ve stuck with the longest, and what’s a project/class topic you could talk about for 5 minutes without preparation?

If you enroll, you can expect a rigorous academic environment with discussion-driven classes and a community where steady, reliable contributions are recognized and supported.\n\nCongratulations—we look forward to having you join us.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_B Admissions Committee",
