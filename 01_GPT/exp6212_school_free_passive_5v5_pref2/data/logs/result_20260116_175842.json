Leadership is accessible—students can start by taking on small roles (event lead, outreach, project coordinator) and grow into officer positions as they demonstrate reliability and initiative.\n\n**Who thrives at School_E:** Curious, collaborative students who take ownership of their learning and contribute to the community.

Successful applicants can point to a role they played over time—organizing, building, mentoring, improving something.\n3) **Community mindset**: We value students who contribute to a respectful, collaborative culture—peer support, inclusive leadership, and reliability. Service is great when it’s connected to a real community need and you can explain your impact.\n4) **Initiative/leadership (formal or informal)**: Starting a small project, improving a club, tutoring a peer, or taking ownership of a team goal all count. We’re interested in “ownership” more than titles.\n\n**Ways to understand student life / events**\n- If you tell me your general availability (weekday evenings vs. weekends) and your top interests (STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, service), I can point you to the best-fit options—e.g., a student-led club visit, a classroom sit-in, or an info session/Q&A format.\n\nA couple quick questions so I can guide you precisely:\n1) Where do you currently see yourself most—STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, or a mix?\n2) What’s one activity you’ve stuck with the longest, and what role do you usually play in groups?\n3) Are you aiming to apply soon, or are you still comparing schools for a bit longer?",

These are structured and goal-based, not drop-in only.\n2) **Fast feedback + weekly study planning:** short check-ins/mini-assessments, quick correction cycles, and a weekly plan that’s adjusted based on what’s actually improving (or not).\n3) **Advising/mentoring:** regular 1:1 goal reviews—students set a goal, track progress, and learn how to study effectively (time management, error analysis, exam strategy).\n4) **Teacher-guided study groups:** peer groups with a clear agenda and teacher oversight so it stays efficient and supportive.\n\n**Students who tend to do best at School_B:**\n- Students who are **consistent** (even if they’re not “perfect” yet) and can follow a plan week-to-week\n- Students who are **coachable**—they use feedback quickly and ask for help early\n- Students who want a community where effort is normal and progress is measurable\n- Students who are aiming for **steady improvement** and are willing to reflect on mistakes (we do a lot of “why did I miss this?” work)\n\n**Leadership / early contribution opportunities (even in the first term):**\n- **Peer study-lead roles** (facilitating a study block with a teacher-provided structure)\n- **New-student support / classroom community roles** (welcoming, organizing study routines, helping build positive norms)\n- **Project/competition teams** once fundamentals are stable—students can take on roles like organizer, editor, or problem-set lead\n- Opportunities to help run **review sessions** or create shared resources (error logs, topic summaries) under teacher supervision\n\nTo advise you honestly about fit: **what are the 1–2 subjects you most want to raise this year, and what kind of support helps you most (structured plan vs. flexible tutoring vs. group study)?** Also, where is **School_B currently in your shortlist** (top choice / top 2–3 / still comparing)?",
