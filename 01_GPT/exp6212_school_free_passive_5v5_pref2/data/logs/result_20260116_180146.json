That said, we review applicants holistically and we’re absolutely open to serious candidates early—if School_B is a real option for you, applying sooner generally helps ensure you’re considered while space remains.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what are you looking for most in a school (academics, activities, environment), and what’s your rough application timeline?",
