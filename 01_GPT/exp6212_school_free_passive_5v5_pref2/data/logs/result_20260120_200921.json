At School_A we look for students who are intellectually curious, consistent in their effort, and engaged in their community (we value growth mindset as much as raw scores). We also pay attention to how you challenge yourself relative to what’s available at your current school and how you collaborate with others.\n\nOn academics/support: we offer advanced/honors pathways (with opportunities for acceleration where appropriate), structured teacher office hours, and a mentoring/advisory system that pairs students with a faculty advisor for goal-setting and check-ins. For enrichment, we have a range of student-led clubs (STEM, humanities, arts, service), and we encourage students to initiate new clubs if they see a need.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what areas are you most excited to pursue (e.g., STEM research, debate/writing, arts, service leadership), and what kind of support environment helps you thrive (more structured mentoring vs. more independent)? If you share that, I can point you to the specific tracks and communities at School_A that match your goals.",

The first semester emphasizes building study routines, connecting with mentors, and exploring activities; by the second semester, many students begin leaning into a track (e.g., advanced math sequence, research/CS, debate/writing, service leadership).\n\nTo help you compare accurately: **what are the 2–3 most important factors for you** (e.g., acceleration, research/competitions, writing/debate, arts, mentoring structure, campus culture)? And which schools are you weighing most closely right now? If you tell me that, I can map School_A’s specific pathways and first-year options to your goals—and be candid about where we’re strongest for what you want.",
