Consistency in core subjects and strong learning habits carry significant weight.\n- Differentiation: once academic readiness is clear, involvement/leadership often becomes the separator—especially sustained depth, initiative, and impact.\n- We also value “contextual leadership”: leading in a lab group, being the dependable teammate, caring for family responsibilities, or building a project—formal titles help, but they’re not required.\n\nIf you share a bit more, I can give you a candid read on fit and what to emphasize:\n1) Your most recent term grades (or general trend) and the most rigorous courses you’ve taken (especially math/English/science).\n2) 1–2 activities you’ve stayed with the longest—your role, what you improved, and any concrete outcomes.\n3) How seriously you’re considering School_B (e.g., roughly where we fall on your list).\n\nIf School_B is a top option for you, applying sooner is beneficial since we have limited capacity and review candidates as they come in.",
