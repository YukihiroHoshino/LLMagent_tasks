Many students combine one “deep” commitment with one exploratory activity.\n- Mentorship: students commonly seek a faculty mentor by the end of year 1 for academic planning, competitions, or a capstone-style project.\n\nA typical successful pathway at School_B:\nYear 1: build strong fundamentals, join 1–2 communities (club/team), and establish good study systems.\nYear 2: step into responsibility (team lead/committee lead), pursue an advanced track in a strength area, and begin a substantial project or competition.\nYear 3+: specialize and produce outcomes—capstone/project, leadership, competition performance, or community impact—supported by mentorship.\n\nTo tailor advice: what’s one area you’re strongest in right now (e.g., math/science, writing/humanities, leadership, arts), and where does School_B currently sit among your top choices?

We also run higher-level problem-solving sessions for students aiming at top-tier exam math.\n- Science (physics/chem/bio): strong lab-to-exam linkage—concept checks first, then application practice. We’re known for clear unit summaries and “typical trap” question training.\n- Language (Japanese/English): reading comprehension and writing are taught with rubrics and frequent short feedback cycles. For English, we focus on vocabulary/grammar foundations plus sustained reading; for Japanese, we emphasize logical essay structure and evidence-based answers.\n\nEntrance-exam prep (structured support)\n- Mock exams: regular in-house mocks plus scheduled reflection sessions (teachers help you turn results into a concrete next-2-weeks plan).\n- Targeted support: small-group help blocks/office hours several days per week; students can bring specific questions or request re-teaching on weak units.\n- Study planning: homeroom-style academic advising (pacing, revision cycles, and prioritization when multiple subjects compete). We’re quite proactive about checking whether your plan is realistic and adjusting it.\n\nClubs/activities (active + well-supported)\n- Competition-oriented: math/science problem-solving groups and academic contest prep (good for students who like measurable goals).\n- Cultural/performance: music and performance clubs with regular showcases.\n- Sports: a few high-participation teams with consistent practice schedules.\n- Student leadership/service: committees and community projects for students who want leadership experience without sacrificing academics.\n\nTo tailor this: (1) are you aiming for a STEM-heavy track or more balanced? (2) what matters most for you—more mock exams, more 1:1/small-group help, or stricter weekly structure? And (3) which clubs are you most likely to commit to?\n\nIf you tell me those, I can map out what a typical week would look like for you at School_C and what support you’d actually receive during peak prep periods.",

That said, because our seat is limited, timing only helps if the application is *complete and compelling* (clear strengths + concrete evidence), not just early.\n\nTo give you the most honest guidance on whether School_B is a strong bet for you, I need two quick specifics:\n1) Your strongest subject + one concrete indicator (recent grades/test/competition/project result).\n2) One sustained commitment where you took responsibility (what you did, for how long, and the impact).\n\nAlso, where do you realistically place School_B among your top choices right now (e.g., #1/#2 vs. #3+)?
