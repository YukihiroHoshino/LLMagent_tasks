If you’re looking for a place where you can grow steadily and be part of a tight community, we try to be that.\n\nTo help you decide whether we’re a strong fit: what are your top priorities in a school (e.g., specific academic areas, clubs/arts/athletics, college counseling, community vibe, commute)? And are there 1–2 activities or goals you’d want to pursue intensely in high school?
