However, School_E ranks me #1 in its priority, so it is a reliable safety option if my higher choices (School_C, School_A, School_D, School_B) reject me later. In round 1, I should keep School_E warm without applying, to preserve flexibility and not lock myself into my worst option."

School_E’s biggest differentiators are:\n\n1) Academics with depth + choice: We offer strong honors/AP pathways (including structured support for first-time AP students), plus advanced electives and project-based courses where students build portfolios (research, presentations, and real-world problem solving).\n\n2) High-touch student support: Each student is assigned an advisor who meets regularly to track goals, workload, and wellbeing. We also run a tutoring center with same-day help, teacher office hours, and targeted study-skill workshops (time management, test strategy, writing support).\n\n3) Clear pathways and outcomes: Students can follow focused “tracks” (STEM/engineering, health & life sciences, humanities/social sciences, business/entrepreneurship, arts). These include capstone projects, mentorship opportunities, and guidance for competitions/internships.\n\n4) Community + belonging: Small learning communities, clubs with active faculty sponsors, and peer mentoring so new students integrate quickly.\n\nTo tailor this: what matters most to you right now—rigorous academics, STEM/labs, arts, sports, college counseling, or a supportive environment with smaller classes? And are there any subjects you’re especially excited about (or worried about)?",
