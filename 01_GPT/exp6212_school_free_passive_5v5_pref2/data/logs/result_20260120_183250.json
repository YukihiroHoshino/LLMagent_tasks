We’re especially drawn to students who can explain *why* a subject matters to them and what they want to explore next.\n2) **Depth of impact (extracurriculars):** we don’t reward “more activities.” What stands out is sustained commitment, measurable contribution, and initiative—e.g., improving a club/team, building a project, mentoring others, or sticking with a long-term goal.\n3) **Character and community contribution:** reliability, collaboration, and how you elevate peers. In conversations, the strongest candidates reflect honestly on setbacks, show curiosity, and communicate how they learn and work with others.\n\n**If you decide to apply: materials/themes to emphasize**\n- **A clear “through-line” (2–3 sentences):** What are you curious about, and how will you pursue it here?\n- **One “deep dive” example:** pick a project/course/competition/activity and be specific about your role, choices you made, what you learned, and what you’d do next.\n- **Community contribution evidence:** concrete examples of teamwork, leadership-by-service, peer support, or improving a shared space (class, club, team). Specifics beat adjectives.\n- **Fit with School_A:** mention 1–2 opportunities you would *actually* use (academic team, independent project with a mentor, leadership in a club) and how you’d engage.\n\n**How we evaluate “community contributors”**\nWe look for patterns: consistency, follow-through, respect in group settings, and initiative that benefits others—not just titles. Even small actions (tutoring a peer, organizing study sessions, building a resource for a club) can be compelling if they’re genuine and sustained.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: what are your top 1–2 academic interests right now, and what’s one example of a time you helped a team or community succeed? Also, are you leaning toward submitting an application to School_A this cycle, or still comparing options?",

We strongly encourage students to use support proactively—early use correlates with the best outcomes.\n- Clubs/teams entry: Clubs are open and welcoming to first-years; we run an activities fair and have low-barrier entry options so students can try a couple before committing. For competitive teams, we outline tryout/placement clearly and offer pathways for beginners where possible.\n\nTo make sure I’m giving you the most relevant guidance: what are your top 1–2 academic interests right now, and what kind of environment helps you do your best (more structure vs. more independence, small-group vs. large-group, etc.)?\n\nAlso, since our single seat can fill quickly: if after this you feel School_D is truly a top destination for you, applying soon is the best way to signal that commitment.",
