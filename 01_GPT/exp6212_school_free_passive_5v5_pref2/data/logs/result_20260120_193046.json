We also look for a good fit with our learning culture—students who ask questions, take feedback well, and are ready for a rigorous but supportive environment.\n\nTypical first-year experience: you’ll start with a solid core curriculum and an advisory/homeroom structure focused on study skills and goal-setting. Many students join at least one club or team in the first term, and we emphasize early connection—peer mentoring, teacher office hours, and structured check-ins so students don’t “drift” academically or socially.\n\nOn timing: we have a small intake (and I personally have only one seat to fill), so we do expect to finalize relatively quickly once we meet applicants who are a clear fit. If School_D is a serious option for you, I’d encourage you to apply when you feel ready—an early application helps.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing: what subjects or activities do you feel most energized by, and what kind of support/challenge are you hoping for in your first year?",

I appreciate the direct question, especially given we only have one seat.\n\n**What we’re prioritizing this cycle** (in order of what tends to matter most in practice):\n1) **Academic readiness + consistency** (solid fundamentals, steady performance, and evidence you can handle a rigorous weekly pace)\n2) **Learning habits** (follow-through, time management, using feedback quickly, asking for help early)\n3) **Community contribution** (reliability, teamwork, and initiative—students who make classes/clubs better day-to-day)\n4) **Fit with our environment** (discussion-based classes, ownership of goals, comfort with challenge)\n\nWe’re **not** looking for one narrow “type” (e.g., only competition winners). We do look for students who can thrive with a demanding workload while staying steady and collaborative.\n\n**On timing:** yes, we expect to move **quickly** once we see a clear mutual fit, because with one seat it can disappear fast.\n\nTo advise you honestly on whether you should apply in the next round, could you share:\n- Where does School_D currently sit among your choices (roughly 1st/2nd/3rd/4th), and what would make it your clear top?\n- What subjects/activities are you most excited to pursue, and what kind of support/challenge helps you perform best?\n\nIf your answers suggest strong fit and School_D is realistically near the top, I’d encourage you to consider submitting an **[APPLY]** soon so we can evaluate you while the seat is still open.",
