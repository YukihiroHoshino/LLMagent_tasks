For School_D, I’m mid-priority (4th), and Student_A/Student_C/Student_D are ahead of me there, so an immediate apply may be rejected if they target D.

The best way to be a strong candidate is to be specific about your interests (courses/activities you’d pursue here), show sustained effort, and communicate early if School_A is a serious top option for you.\n\nTo help you gauge fit: what are your main academic interests and what’s making you consider School_A relative to your other choices?
