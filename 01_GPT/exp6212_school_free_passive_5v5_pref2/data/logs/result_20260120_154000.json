I’m looking for a rigorous academic environment where I can contribute consistently and grow, and School_A stands out to me for its strong expectations and community. If admitted, I would commit to engaging fully in classes and contributing through clubs/activities and peer support. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like to hear about (academic interests, activities, or goals). [APPLY]",

D and C are likely already matched given they are not in the remaining schools list; E is still available but highly competitive (E prioritizes me last). A is still available and I’m 4th in School_A’s priority list, so my acceptance chances are moderate if higher-priority students commit elsewhere. Since we’re in round 3 and I’ve only talked so far, it’s time to apply to avoid ending up with only School_B (my last choice) or unmatched. Applying to A doesn’t prevent me from preferring higher schools if they were available, but they aren’t. So I should apply now with a clear, sincere fit statement."

I already applied to E earlier; if E accepts someone else, I need B as the best remaining option. School_B’s priority list ranks me last, so I’m unlikely to win B if higher-priority students are also applying, but since B is still open in round 4, there’s a chance others are matched elsewhere.

Student_D is applying now and promises to commit, reducing enrollment risk.
