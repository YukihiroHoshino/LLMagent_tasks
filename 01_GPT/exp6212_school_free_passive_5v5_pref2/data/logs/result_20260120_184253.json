In practice, we weigh:\n1) **Academic readiness & trajectory**: consistent effort, upward trend, and at least one area where you go beyond the minimum (a project, independent learning, competition, deeper reading, etc.).\n2) **Sustained commitment**: one or two activities/responsibilities you’ve stuck with and improved over time (leadership is great, but follow-through matters even more).\n3) **Community contribution**: how you collaborate, support peers, and take initiative—especially in small, concrete ways.\n4) **Specificity of interest in School_E**: applicants stand out when they can clearly connect *our* programs/culture to *their* goals (not generic “good academics”).\n\nWhat makes someone stand out in a one-seat situation is a clear, consistent story: “Here’s what I care about, here’s proof I do it, and here’s why School_E is the best place for the next step.”\n\nTo give you the most accurate guidance (and to understand your fit better), could you answer these three quickly:\n- What are your strongest subjects right now, and what’s one example of work you’re proud of?\n- What’s the most sustained activity or responsibility you’ve had over the last year (and what impact did you have)?\n- Why is School_E on your list *relative to* the other schools you’re considering—what do you believe you’d do here specifically (club/team/project/service)?\n\nIf you share that, I can tell you exactly what to emphasize if you decide to apply to School_E.",
