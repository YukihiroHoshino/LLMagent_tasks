At School_A, we value students who are academically curious, consistent in their effort, and proactive about seeking help and contributing to the community (study groups, clubs, peer support). We also look for strong habits: time management, resilience when work gets challenging, and respect for classmates and teachers.\n\nA typical first-year experience includes a structured transition period at the start of the year (advisory/check-ins, study-skills support), core coursework with increasing emphasis on analytical writing and problem-solving, and encouragement to join at least one club or activity to build connections. Students also have access to office hours and academic support resources, and we place a lot of emphasis on setting goals early and reviewing progress regularly.\n\nTo help me advise you better: what subjects or activities are you most excited to pursue in high school, and what kind of support environment helps you thrive (e.g., frequent feedback, tutoring/office hours, small-group learning, independent projects)?",
