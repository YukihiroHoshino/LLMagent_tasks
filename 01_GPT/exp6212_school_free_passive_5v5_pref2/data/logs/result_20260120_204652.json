In School_C’s priority list I am last, so my chance depends on higher-priority students going elsewhere. Student_B (top priority) prefers E then C; Student_A prefers E then B then D then A then C; Student_D prefers E then A; Student_E prefers C first. Since E is already matched, B and A may take C’s higher-priority candidates away, but Student_E could still compete strongly for C. Best strategy is to keep strong interest visible without overcommitting beyond what the protocol allows; continue TALK, signal readiness to accept immediately if offered, and ask if any updates/continued interest helps."
