With only a few openings, timing and likelihood of enrollment matter.\n\nIf you submit a formal application, what would most strengthen it right now is:\n- A clear “why School_A” that’s specific (programs/courses, learning environment, community contributions) rather than general.\n- Evidence of follow-through and growth in 1–2 core academic areas (what you’ve challenged yourself with and how you responded).\n- Depth/impact in one or two activities (responsibility, initiative, sustained commitment).\n\nTo help you be realistic about fit and timing: where does School_A sit on your list right now (e.g., top 1–2 vs. mid-list), and if we were able to offer you a spot, would you be prepared to accept quickly?
