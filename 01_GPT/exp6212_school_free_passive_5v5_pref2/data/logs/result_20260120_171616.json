I’m specifically seeking a rigorous environment with clear expectations and strong teacher support—exactly what I understand School_D emphasizes.\n\nIs there any single remaining concern or specific detail you need (recent grades, subjects, activities) to move from consideration to an acceptance now?",

School_D’s priority list ranks me 4th, so they may be holding out for higher-priority students, but those students appear matched elsewhere given only School_D remains.
