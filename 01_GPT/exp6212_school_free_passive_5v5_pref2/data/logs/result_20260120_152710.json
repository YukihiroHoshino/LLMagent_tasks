I’m glad you’re taking fit seriously.\n\n**What distinguishes School_A (academics + culture):**\n- **Academic depth with support:** We’re rigorous, but the norm is that students use office hours, peer collaboration, and feedback cycles—strong outcomes without a “sink-or-swim” vibe.\n- **Curiosity + initiative culture:** Students are encouraged to design independent projects (research, community initiatives, engineering builds, writing portfolios). We value substance and follow-through over résumé-stacking.\n- **Community-minded environment:** Collaboration is a real expectation—students who contribute to others’ learning and show maturity tend to thrive here.\n\n**What makes an applicant stand out for School_A:**\n- **Clear academic direction (even if broad):** e.g., “I’m exploring CS + social impact,” or “I want deeper humanities seminars + debate/writing.”\n- **Sustained commitment with impact:** One or two activities where you’ve taken ownership, improved something, or produced tangible results.\n- **Specific fit:** Concrete reasons our program structure, offerings, or culture match how you learn and what you want to build.\n\nIf you’re open to it, tell me two quick things so I can give more tailored guidance:\n1) What subjects energize you most right now?\n2) What’s one project/activity you’ve stuck with and what role did you play?\n\nIf School_A could be a strong fit, I’d encourage you to consider applying soon—your profile sounds like it could align well with what we prioritize.",

Student_D ranks School_A as 2nd and may apply; Student_C ranks School_A 4th and has been talking.
