Student_B has School_C as 2nd choice and is top priority at School_C, and Student_E has School_C as 1st choice (though School_C ranks E above me).

Students who want both rigor and consistent guidance tend to thrive here.\n\n**Student culture:** The culture is collaborative rather than competitive—study groups are common, and older students actively mentor younger students. We put a lot of emphasis on belonging and making sure students feel supported socially as well as academically.\n\n**Standout programs:** School_E is especially strong in **college-prep advising and academic enrichment** (advanced seminars, project-based coursework, and opportunities to pursue deeper work in areas you care about). We also have a well-developed set of clubs and leadership pathways so students can build a clear “story” over time.\n\nTo make this concrete for you: what matters most in your decision—(1) academic rigor, (2) support/mentoring, (3) specific subjects/programs, (4) extracurriculars/culture, or (5) something else?
