I’m happy to share more about School_C.\n\nAcademics & program: We’re a rigorous, college-prep environment with strong core academics and structured support (office hours/extra help, close progress monitoring). We value students who are ready to take on challenging coursework and who show steady improvement and follow-through.\n\nActivities & fit: We prioritize students who will contribute to the community—clubs, teams, arts, service, leadership, or a clear interest area they want to grow. Fit-wise, we look for curiosity, reliability, and a collaborative mindset.\n\nHow we prioritize: In general, we weigh academic readiness (grades/trajectory), engagement outside class (depth > number of activities), and evidence you’ll take advantage of what we offer.\n\nOn competitiveness: If you apply later, whether you’re competitive depends on your academic record and what you’re looking for (and how well that aligns with School_C). If you tell me what subjects you’re strongest in, what you want to pursue (STEM/humanities/arts), and the activities you’re most committed to, I can give a more specific sense of fit.\n\nAlso—what are your top priorities in choosing a school this year (academics, specific programs, campus culture, commute, etc.)?",

In round 1, best move is to provide an appealing, informative response and probe their interests, while signaling that strong academic fit and engagement matter and that their profile could be competitive if they apply. Do not commit the seat; keep flexibility for higher-priority students who may apply later."
