At School_B, we value (1) consistent academic effort and upward trajectory, (2) intellectual curiosity—students who ask good questions and follow through, (3) collaboration and reliability in group settings, and (4) clear purpose: being able to explain what you want to explore and why.\n\nWhat distinguishes School_B is our balance of rigor and support: smaller advisory-style mentoring, structured academic coaching, and project-based coursework where students build a portfolio (research, presentations, and real-world problem solving) rather than focusing only on test performance. We also emphasize a strong school community—students are expected to contribute, not just compete.\n\nTo help you see whether we’re a strong fit: what subjects or track are you most interested in (STEM, humanities, interdisciplinary), and what kind of learning environment helps you thrive (fast-paced/independent vs. guided/mentored)? If you share that, I can be specific about programs and how you could present your strengths to match what we look for.",

Since it’s round 1 and I have better targets (School_C where I’m 4th, and School_A where I’m last), I should not commit yet; instead, I should keep School_D warm and gather info while preserving flexibility to apply later if needed."
