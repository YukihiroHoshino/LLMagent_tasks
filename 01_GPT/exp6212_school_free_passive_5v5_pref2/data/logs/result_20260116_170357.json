At School_B I’m ranked last (#5), so waiting/just talking risks losing the seat to higher-priority students (A/B/C/E). Since this is a decentralized, first-accept match process, I should apply now to School_B to try to lock in a match rather than risk ending up with School_D or nothing if School_A fills.
