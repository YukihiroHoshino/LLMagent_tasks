We emphasize clear feedback cycles (regular check-ins, revision opportunities, and office hours).\n- Clubs/activities: Students usually join 1–2 clubs in the first term; common pathways are STEM/robotics, debate, arts, and service. We encourage trying one “new-to-you” activity.\n- Support: Each first-year has an advisor, plus tutoring/peer study groups. We monitor workload closely early on and intervene quickly if a student is slipping.\n\nTo help me give the most relevant details: what are your top priorities in a school (e.g., advanced STEM, humanities, arts, athletics, college counseling, community vibe)? And where does School_C currently sit on your list—are we a “maybe,” or are you mainly comparing us to a few specific schools?",
