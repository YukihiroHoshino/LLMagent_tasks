School_A is one of my top choices, and if admitted I will commit and enroll. I believe I’m a strong fit for your community and would contribute through consistent academic effort and active participation in school life. Thank you for your consideration.",

I already applied to School_B, but School_B ranks me last, so my chances there are poor. School_A ranks me 2nd (behind Student_B), giving me a strong chance if I apply now and signal commitment. Applying to School_A maximizes the likelihood of matching to a high-ranked option rather than risking ending up unmatched or stuck competing at School_B."

Accepting D now secures a top match and avoids risk of ending with E or an empty seat. Student_D also signals strong commitment to enroll, further reducing uncertainty."
