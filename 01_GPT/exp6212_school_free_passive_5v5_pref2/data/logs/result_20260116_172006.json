With capacity 1, acceptance is uncertain, but applying now is optimal because (1) it’s my #1 and (2) early commitment could secure the seat if higher-priority students pursue other top options (many prefer School_E or School_D first).

With quota 1, we prefer higher-ranked students (B, A, D) but there is no guarantee they will apply to us soon since several rank other schools above School_C. Student_E ranks School_C as first choice and is applying now with a commitment signal, so accepting secures a feasible match rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-priority outcome."

However, I should not apply immediately in round 1 because my 1st choice is School_E and many others also rank E highly; I want to keep flexibility to pursue E first. Still, it’s valuable to signal strong interest to School_A because School_A ranks me 2nd in its priority list, so I’m a very competitive candidate there.
