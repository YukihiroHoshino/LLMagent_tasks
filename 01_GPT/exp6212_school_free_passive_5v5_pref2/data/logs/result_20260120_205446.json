We look for students who can discuss a challenge they faced, what they learned, and how they’d approach a rigorous environment.\n\n**What applicants sometimes overlook (but we value a lot)**\n- **Concrete examples of collaboration**: how you work in groups, support peers, and handle disagreement respectfully.\n- **Intellectual curiosity outside assignments**: a book/article/topic you pursued on your own, a project you initiated, or questions you consistently chase.\n- **Service and responsibility that isn’t “official”**: family responsibilities, mentoring, part-time work—these can strongly signal maturity and follow-through.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, two quick questions so I can advise you more specifically:\n1) Where does **School_D** currently sit among your top choices (e.g., top 1–2, top 3)?\n2) What’s one academic area or activity where you’ve shown the most *depth* (and what did you actually do over time)?\n\nIf School_D is a serious contender for you, I encourage you to apply when you’re ready—your message already reflects the kind of steady contribution and challenge-seeking mindset we like to see.",

It’s plausible that Student_D may approach us relatively soon if their top option doesn’t finalize quickly. Student_B is harder to predict and, in many cases, may prioritize other options first before circling back.\n\n2) On holding the seat vs. early applications: we do take early applications seriously—an [APPLY] signals genuine intent, and we respond based on overall fit and our priorities. That said, with only one seat, we also have to manage timing carefully; we typically won’t “promise to hold” the seat indefinitely if we believe higher-priority applicants may still be in play.\n\nIf School_A is a realistic destination for you (not just a hedge), I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready.
