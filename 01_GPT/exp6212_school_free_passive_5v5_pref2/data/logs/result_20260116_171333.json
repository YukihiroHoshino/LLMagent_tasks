I strongly prefer C, but I have already applied/talked to C multiple times without acceptance, and C’s priority ranks me 4th (behind B, A, D), so my chances there are low if any of those apply. School_E’s priority ranks me 1st, so I can likely secure a match there if needed. Since I haven’t applied to E yet and it can serve as a safety while I’m still unmatched, I should apply now to avoid ending up unmatched if C fills with higher-priority students."

Given quotas are 1 each and School_E likely prioritizes Student_E then Student_B ahead of me, my chance at School_E may be limited if they apply.

I have top priority at School_C, which makes acceptance highly likely if I apply now. Waiting to chase School_E (#1) risks losing School_C to another applicant, and School_E prioritizes Student_E first, so my chance there is less secure. Best strategy is to lock in School_C with an application."
