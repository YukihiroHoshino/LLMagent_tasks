They also balance ambition with collaboration.\n\nTo help you decide whether we’re the right fit—and to see how we can support your goals—what areas are you most excited to grow in (STEM, humanities, arts, athletics), and what’s one achievement you’re proud of this year?

Since the student sent [TALK], respond with [TALK] and ask targeted questions about likelihood of applying and strengths, without committing."
