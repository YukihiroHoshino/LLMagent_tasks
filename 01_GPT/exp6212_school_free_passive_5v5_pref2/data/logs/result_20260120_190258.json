That said, we are open to accepting a strong applicant even if they’re not our top-ranked—IF the application comes with a clear, near-term commitment signal (e.g., “School_B is my first choice if admitted” or a firm decision timeline).\n\nIf you’re considering waiting one more round, the risk is that the seat could be filled by an applicant who applies earlier with a clear intent to enroll.\n\n(2) Biggest differentiators (concrete):\n- Structured academic support built into the week: scheduled guided study periods, regular advisor check-ins, and fast access to subject-specific tutoring/office hours.\n- High-rigor pathways with mentorship: opportunities to pursue project-based work (e.g., extended investigations, competition prep, research-style projects depending on department) with a teacher mentor.\n- Planning + accountability: each student has an advisor who helps map a coherent course/extracurricular plan and monitors progress so students don’t “fall through the cracks.”\n\nTo help you decide this round: if admitted by School_B, would you enroll (or what exact condition would need to be met)?
