Students who like working through hard problems steadily tend to do very well.\n- **Writing & seminar discussion**: guided analytical writing, frequent feedback cycles, and discussion-based classes that reward preparation and clear reasoning.\n- **Longer projects**: we’re strong on sustained work (capstone-style projects, research/engineering builds, publication/competition submissions) because we provide checkpoints and mentoring.\n\n**Clubs/activities where we have depth:**\n- Academic teams (math/science), programming/robotics-style build teams, debate/speaking, and service/leadership groups that run year-round (we value continuity over “trying everything once”).\n\n**Who tends to thrive at School_B:**\n- Students who like a **structured environment** with clear expectations and steady pace.\n- Students with **persistence**—not necessarily the highest starting point, but those who keep iterating and improving.\n- Students who contribute reliably to a team/community (showing up, following through, helping others).\n\n**How we weigh academics vs. activities:**\n- **Academics are the baseline** (course rigor, consistency, and trajectory matter a lot).\n- Activities matter most when they show **depth and impact**: sustained commitment, leadership, tangible outputs (projects, performances, competition work, service outcomes).\n- If there’s a tradeoff, we tend to favor students who show they can handle the academic program **and** have at least one area of real commitment.\n\nTo tell you honestly whether it’s a strong fit: what are your top 1–2 academic interests right now (e.g., math/CS, lab science, humanities), and do you prefer a more structured or more self-directed school day?
