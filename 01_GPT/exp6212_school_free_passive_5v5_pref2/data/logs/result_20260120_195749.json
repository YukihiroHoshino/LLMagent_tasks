I’m a consistent, collaborative student who contributes reliably (for example, I organized a weekly study group during a difficult unit to help classmates improve understanding and participation). If offered a place, I will accept immediately.",
              "thought": "School_E is my last choice, but only School_D and School_E remain unmatched. I have repeatedly pursued School_D and likely face higher-priority competitors there, so securing any match may require compromising. School_E ranks me #1 in its priority list, so an application now is very likely to be accepted and would lock in a match rather than risking being left unmatched if School_D fills. Given round 9 and the risk of missing out entirely, I should apply to School_E."

Prior rejections to C/D do not matter now; fill seat with top choice."

              "thought": "We are School_D with quota 1 and no current match. Remaining unmatched students are C and E. Our true priority ranks A first, C second, D third, E fourth, B fifth; so Student_C is very high. Student_C also states School_D is top choice and will commit immediately, reducing risk. Accepting C secures a top-ranked match and ends uncertainty versus continuing with E (lower priority) who has not provided requested measurable academic outcome and was previously rejected. Therefore accept Student_C now."
