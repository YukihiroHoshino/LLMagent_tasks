If you decide we’re a strong fit, what would you need to see to feel ready to apply?\n\nIf you share a bit more, I can suggest which pathways/clubs to emphasize and how to frame them most credibly.",

We don’t want to pressure anyone, but we also can’t guarantee the seat stays open if we get an [APPLY] from a top-fit student.\n\n**How we evaluate priority among interested students**\nWe maintain an internal priority order and use it alongside the holistic review above. When multiple students are interested around the same time, we tend to move fastest with applicants who (a) are a strong fit by our criteria and (b) indicate School_B is a **top choice** with a clear timeline.\n\nTo advise you concretely: where does School_B currently sit on your list (top 1–2, top 3, etc.), and what’s your decision timeline if you were to apply?

If a student is still comparing and not ready to commit, we’re happy to keep talking—but we can’t guarantee the seat stays open.\n\nTo advise you strategically: where does School_B currently sit on your preference list (top 1/top 2/top 3, etc.), and what’s your decision timeline? Also, what are 1–2 academic areas you’re most excited to pursue, and one activity/commitment you’re most proud of? That will help me give you a realistic sense of whether applying soon makes sense here.",

Remaining unmatched students are C, D, E; School_B prefers A/B first but they appear already matched elsewhere or unlikely to approach now. Student_E has shown sustained interest and ranks #4, while Student_D ranks last (#5). Student_C’s own preferences place School_B last, so commitment risk is high; better to keep dialogue, assess whether B can move up their list, and avoid early accept unless they apply with clear commitment. Provide transparent criteria and signal that a strong, committed application can secure the single seat, while asking for their ranking/timeline to gauge seriousness."
