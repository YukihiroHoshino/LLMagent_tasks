Happy to be specific.\n\nWhat tends to matter most when we choose among strong applicants:\n1) **Academic readiness & trajectory (foundation first):** We look for consistent performance and evidence you can handle a structured, fast-moving curriculum. Test scores/grades help, but we weigh them together with course rigor and improvement over time.\n2) **Fit + reliability:** In a one-seat environment, we prioritize students who can clearly explain *why School_D* and who are genuinely prepared to commit if admitted.\n3) **Ownership and contribution:** Leadership is great, but we value “follow-through” even more—initiatives you sustained, responsibilities you held consistently, and how you made a group better.\n\nWhere we’re especially looking for motivated students this year (signature pathways):\n- **Advanced Academic Track (with close advising):** Best for students aiming for a competitive university pathway who want structure, frequent feedback, and accountability.\n- **Project/Community Impact pathway:** Students who want to build a portfolio through longer-term projects (research, community initiatives, peer tutoring/mentoring) and can document outcomes.\n\nTo help you see where you’d contribute most: what are your **top 2–3 schools right now**, and which direction fits you best—more **academics-intensive**, more **project/leadership**, or a **balanced** plan? Also, what’s your **timeline**—are you considering applying in the next round or two?\n\nIf School_D is truly near the top for you, applying sooner is generally safer in our process because we do move quickly when we see a clear fit.",
