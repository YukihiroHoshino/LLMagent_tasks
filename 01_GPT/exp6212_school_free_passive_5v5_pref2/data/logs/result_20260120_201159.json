If you have an interest that isn’t represented, we’re supportive of starting something new.\n- Support: accessible teacher office hours, advising for course planning, and structured check-ins for students who want extra accountability.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant picture: what are you hoping to prioritize in a high school (e.g., advanced academics, specific clubs like robotics/debate/music, athletics, or a particular kind of support)?

We also run project-based work inside core classes (especially in science/humanities) so you’re applying concepts, not just studying for tests. Extracurriculars are robust, but they’re designed to complement academics rather than compete with them—students can go deep without feeling like they have to choose between clubs and grades.\n\n(2) Who thrives at School_A: students who do best here are (a) self-motivated but willing to ask for help early, (b) consistent in their routines, and (c) comfortable with constructive feedback—because we push for steady improvement, not perfection. Curiosity and follow-through matter a lot: students who take initiative (joining an academic team, proposing a project, seeking mentorship) tend to unlock the most opportunities.\n\nFor students who want to push themselves academically, supports/opportunities include:\n- Higher-level/advanced course pathways (with placement guidance so you’re stretched but not overloaded).\n- Regular teacher office hours/tutoring and structured study support when you’re taking on harder classes.\n- Academic teams/competitions and faculty-mentored projects (great if you like going beyond the syllabus).\n- Counseling/advisory check-ins to help manage workload and plan a challenging but sustainable schedule.\n\nTo help me advise you honestly: what subjects are you most excited to push in (math/science, humanities, languages), and what kind of challenge are you looking for—faster pace, deeper projects, or competition/olympiad-style work?

Given School_C’s priority list ranks me last, they may have been holding out for higher-priority students, but none are available now, so the best move is a final direct commitment and request for an immediate decision."
