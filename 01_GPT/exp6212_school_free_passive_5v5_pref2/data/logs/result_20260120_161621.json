If it looks like they’re focusing elsewhere, I’m prepared to submit an application to School_B promptly this round or next.",

With School_E likely taken by higher-priority students (Student_E/Student_B/Student_A ahead of me) and School_A also competitive (Student_B has top priority and may apply), I should keep School_B as a strong backup. However, School_B’s priority list ranks me last, so an immediate [APPLY] is likely to be rejected if others apply. Best move is to [TALK] to gauge whether Student_A/Student_B/Student_C are pursuing School_B, and signal credible interest so I can apply quickly if the seat looks attainable."

With one seat, the best way to be considered seriously is to apply when you’re ready.\n\nIf School_B is genuinely one of your top choices and you’re prepared to enroll if admitted, I’d encourage you to submit an application this round rather than waiting—timing can matter when we have limited capacity.\n\nBefore you decide, one quick question: if we were to offer you the seat, would School_B be your first choice (i.e., would you commit)? That helps us understand how to proceed given our single opening.",
              "thought": "Student_D is last on our true priority list, so we should not commit early if there’s a realistic chance to match with Student_B (rank #2) or Student_E (rank #4). Student_B prefers School_E > School_C > School_D > School_B, so School_B is their 4th choice; they may apply here only if rejected elsewhere. Student_E prefers School_C > School_A > School_D > School_B, so School_B is also their 4th choice. Both could still come to us late, but neither is likely to apply immediately unless they strike out. Since we have one seat and want to keep flexibility, we should encourage Student_D to apply if School_B is truly a top choice, but avoid promising the seat or revealing too much about other students. Goal: elicit a credible commitment signal (apply now) while preserving option value."

Student_B’s top choices are School_E then School_C; if they are still unmatched they might pivot to School_A, but given the market state it’s likely they are already matched elsewhere.

Likely competitors for B: A and B themselves prefer B mid-to-high; but since only A and B schools remain, other students may already be matched elsewhere. To avoid ending unmatched, I should apply to School_B now and make a credible commitment while highlighting fit."
