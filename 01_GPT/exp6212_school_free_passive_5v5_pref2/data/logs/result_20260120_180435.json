Students often highlight our advanced coursework options, research/independent study opportunities, and a vibrant set of clubs and community service pathways.\n\nTo help me point you to the most relevant programs, what are you hoping to prioritize in a high school—advanced academics, arts, athletics, STEM/research, leadership, or something else?

We value follow-through more than titles.\n- Growth mindset: students who seek feedback, use support, and show upward trajectory.\n\n(2) First-year support\n- Advising/mentoring: each student is placed in an advisory group with regular check-ins; counselors help with course planning and adjusting workload early.\n- Academic support: scheduled office hours, tutoring options, and early progress monitoring so we can intervene before small gaps grow.\n- Club onboarding: club fairs early in the year, peer leaders who recruit/mentor new members, and a clear process to join teams or propose a new club with a faculty sponsor.\n- Transition supports: orientation + routines for time management, study skills, and connecting students to peers.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing, it would help me understand fit:\n1) What areas you most want to pursue (STEM/humanities/arts/athletics/service)?\n2) What environment helps you thrive (structured vs. flexible, collaborative vs. independent)?\n3) Where does School_A currently sit on your shortlist, and what would you need to see to feel confident applying here?\n\nIf School_A is a serious contender for you, I’d encourage you to consider submitting an application when you’re ready—your questions suggest you’re thinking carefully about fit, which we value.",

              "thought": "Student_E is on School_A's true priority list but ranked last (5th). With quota 1 and remaining unmatched students A, D, E, School_A prefers B then D then A then C then E. B and C are already matched elsewhere; remaining higher-priority options are Student_D (2nd) and Student_A (3rd). Student_D ranks School_A as 2nd choice and could apply later; Student_A ranks School_A 4th and has only been talking. Given the chance to still secure a higher-priority student within remaining rounds, accepting Student_E now would block better outcomes. Therefore reject while encouraging continued interest in case circumstances change, but per rules must decide now on this application."

Since School_A is also still unmatched and is much higher on my list (2nd), I should avoid committing to School_E now and instead keep the option open while I try for School_A. I’ll continue talking to School_E to maintain interest and gather info without locking in."
