School_E will likely take Student_E (its top) if Student_E applies there, but Student_E's top choice is School_C and they are applying now, making this a secure match. However, School_E is Student_B's top; if School_E takes Student_E, Student_B may apply to School_C next, which we would prefer. Therefore, reject Student_E now to keep seat for Student_B, our top priority, who has a realistic chance to come to us after School_E fills.

Could you share what you prioritize most in admissions and what makes students successful at School_B (academics, extracurriculars, community)? Also, do you have a sense of your decision timeline this round so I can plan my applications responsibly?",
              "thought": "School_B is 4th on my true list (E, C, D, B, A). It’s acceptable but not ideal. I haven’t interacted with B yet. Given quotas are 1 each and we’re already in round 3 with only A, B, C unmatched, it’s likely E and D are already filled. My best remaining option is School_C (ranked 2nd), where I have top priority, but I’m not currently paired with them. If I apply to B now, I might get rejected because School_B’s top priority is Student_A, and A also ranks B 2nd, so B may hold out for A. Still, expressing interest could help if A goes elsewhere. I should [TALK] to signal interest and ask about timeline/priority, while keeping flexibility to apply to C when I get the chance."

I’m glad you’re considering School_B.\n\nWhat we prioritize most in admissions (and what predicts success here):\n1) Academic readiness + consistency: strong fundamentals and evidence you follow through (steady performance, improvement, good learning habits).\n2) Fit with our programs and culture: students who can clearly connect their interests to what we offer (advanced coursework, clubs/projects, community initiatives).\n3) Reliability and contribution: collaboration, responsibility, and a track record of contributing to teams or communities.\n\nStudent support: we emphasize structured academic support (teacher office hours, advising/check-ins, and early intervention when a student starts to slip), plus strong club/mentor communities so students feel connected quickly.\n\nTimeline this round: we’re prepared to make decisions quickly when there’s a clear mutual fit and a high likelihood the student will enroll. If we don’t see that clarity, we may wait rather than commit prematurely.\n\nSo I can help you plan responsibly (and be candid):\n- Where does School_B currently sit on your preference list (roughly)?\n- If you applied to School_B and we offered you a seat this round, would you be ready to commit, or are you likely to prioritize another school first?\n\nIf you share 1–2 academic interests and an extracurricular you’d want to pursue, I can also point you to the specific programs at School_B that would be the best match.",

Student_B currently ranks School_B 4th, so yield risk is high; we should actively pitch fit and try to elicit a credible commitment signal. Since Student_B sent [TALK], we cannot accept yet; we should answer questions and ask directly whether we can be their top/near-top choice and whether they would commit if accepted this round."
