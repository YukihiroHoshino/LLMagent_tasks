At the same time, we *want* students in clubs/sports—our best outcomes come from students who commit to 1–2 activities meaningfully rather than overloading. In busy seasons, we coach students on planning (weekly schedules, milestone check-ins) so they can sustain both.\n\n**Signature programs / courses to learn more about**\n- **Advanced STEM track options** (accelerated math/science pathways and project-based lab work)\n- **Analytical writing & seminar-style humanities** (frequent feedback + revision, discussion-heavy classes)\n- **Capstone-style projects** (longer-term research or applied projects with presentation components)\n\nTo help you judge fit: what’s your most important “must-have” in a high school (e.g., strongest academics, a specific sport/club, a certain kind of peer culture)?
