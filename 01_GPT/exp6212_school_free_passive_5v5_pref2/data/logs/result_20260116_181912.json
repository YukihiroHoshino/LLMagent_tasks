Students often build toward capstone-style projects.\n- Humanities/communication pathway: debate/speech, writing-intensive electives, and seminar-style classes emphasizing argumentation and presentation.\n- Research/project opportunities: longer-term projects with faculty mentorship (often interdisciplinary).\n- Arts + performance: ensembles and student-led productions/creative showcases (strong for students who want both rigor and a creative outlet).\n\nTo tailor this to you: what are 1–2 areas you’d most want to “go deep” in (STEM research/competitions, debate/writing, arts, or something else)? And when you think about workload, what kind of support helps you most—structure/check-ins, flexibility/independence, or a mix?\n\nIf you’re seriously considering us, I’d encourage you to submit an application when you’re ready—once we have that, we can talk much more concretely about fit and which pathway would match your goals.",
