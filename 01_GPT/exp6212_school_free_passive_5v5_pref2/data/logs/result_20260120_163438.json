Although School_E is my top choice, I am only 2nd in School_E’s priority and there is competition (Student_A and Student_D rank School_E first).

I should not apply immediately because I have better options, and School_B’s priority list ranks me 4th (behind A, B, C), so my acceptance chances may be weak if higher-priority students apply. However, it is still on my list, so I should keep the door open and gather information while signaling interest without committing."

At School_B, students tend to thrive when they’re curious, consistent in their effort, and willing to contribute to a collaborative community (class discussions, clubs, peer support). In applicants, we especially value:\n\n- Strong academic fundamentals and an upward trajectory (we like to see growth)\n- Clear interests (even if still developing) and evidence you pursue them—projects, competitions, reading, community work, etc.\n- Character and community fit: reliability, teamwork, and initiative\n\nIf you apply later, it helps to highlight 1–2 areas you care about most and show concrete examples of what you’ve done (a specific project, leadership moment, or challenge you overcame), plus what you hope to explore at School_B.\n\nTo help me advise you better: what subjects or activities energize you most, and what are you hoping a high school environment will provide (rigor, arts, STEM, athletics, leadership, support, etc.)?",
              "thought": "Student_E is 4th on our true priority list (acceptable but not top). They are currently just talking, so we should keep them warm while preserving flexibility to pursue Student_A/Student_B/Student_C if they become available.
