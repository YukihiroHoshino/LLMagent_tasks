Students commonly pursue independent projects with faculty mentorship.\n- Clubs/activities: strong STEM and humanities societies, arts ensembles, service groups, and competitive teams; it’s easy to start a new club if you have a clear plan and a faculty sponsor.\n- Support: structured advising, peer tutoring, and regular check-ins; we’re attentive to workload balance and help students plan schedules strategically.\n\nTo help me give you the most relevant picture: what are your top 2–3 priorities in a school (e.g., strongest department, club ecosystem, college counseling, arts/athletics, class size, support structure)? And what kinds of activities do you hope to pursue?\n\nIf School_E sounds aligned, we’d be excited to see an application from you.",
