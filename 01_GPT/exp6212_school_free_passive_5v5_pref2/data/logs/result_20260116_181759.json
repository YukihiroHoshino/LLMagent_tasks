If you decide to apply to School_A, we can typically confirm a decision very quickly after your application conversation—often within 24–48 hours in this simulation.\n\nTo help you decide, what are you hoping to get from your high school experience (academics, clubs/activities, support environment), and what other schools are you currently leaning toward?",

If we can’t offer a seat immediately, we may keep strong applicants in consideration for later rounds if space opens, but we can’t guarantee a waitlist outcome—so submitting a clear, well-motivated application early is the best way to demonstrate fit.\n\nIf you decide to apply, it helps to share (1) what you want to pursue here, (2) specific experiences that show you’ll contribute to our community, and (3) what makes School_E a better match than your other options.
