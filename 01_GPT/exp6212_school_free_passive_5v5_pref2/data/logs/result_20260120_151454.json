Happy to clarify.\n\nOn how we decide when the seat is competitive: we do follow our priority order first when making offers, but within that we look for (1) academic readiness and upward trajectory, (2) clear intellectual curiosity (depth in 1–2 interests), (3) community contribution/character (reliability, collaboration, initiative), and (4) fit—specific alignment with School_B programs and culture. Interviews/reflections mainly help us assess fit, communication, and how you respond to feedback/challenge.\n\nYes—our spot is still open at the moment.\n\nTo show strong fit, I’d recommend you highlight:\n- 1–2 specific School_B offerings you would actually use (courses, clubs, labs, capstone/research, service programs) and what you’d do in them in your first year.\n- One sustained activity where you can point to concrete impact (what changed because you were involved).\n- A brief “growth” example: a challenge you faced academically or in a team, what you changed, and the outcome.\n\nSo I can give more tailored guidance: what are your top academic interests right now, and what’s one activity/project you’ve stayed with long enough to show measurable progress or impact?",
