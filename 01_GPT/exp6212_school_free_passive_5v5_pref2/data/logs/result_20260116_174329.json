If admitted, School_A would be my top remaining choice and I would enroll. Academically, I’m motivated by a structured, rigorous environment and I’m especially interested in building strength in core subjects while contributing through consistent effort and collaboration. Outside class, I’m the kind of student who shows up reliably—joining a couple of activities and taking on steady responsibilities rather than overcommitting. If helpful, I’m happy to share specific coursework interests, how I handle workload, or what I hope to contribute to the School_A community. [TALK]",

I already applied to School_A in the prior round, so I cannot apply again; I should reinforce interest and provide additional value to improve my standing. School_A’s priority ranks me last, so I need to differentiate and signal strong commitment/fit. Remaining unmatched schools include School_D (my #3) and School_B (my #4); I should keep School_A engaged while being ready to pivot later if rejected."

We already rejected their earlier APPLY, and there are still unmatched Student_D (ranked 2) and Student_C (ranked 4). Given quota 1, we should not commit to Student_E now; instead keep the conversation open to preserve fallback while trying to attract Student_D if possible. Student_E signals strong commitment, which is useful as insurance if higher-priority students don’t apply. Respond with TALK, ask for concrete fit details and timeline, and avoid any promise."
