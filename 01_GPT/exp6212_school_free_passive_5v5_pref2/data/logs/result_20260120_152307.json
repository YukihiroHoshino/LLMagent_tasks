Based on your application and our earlier conversation, we’d be excited to have you join School_B.\n\nIf you’re able, please send (1) a brief note on one academic area you’re most eager to grow in here and (2) one way you hope to contribute to our community (club, service, peer support, etc.). These won’t affect the decision—just help us place you well and connect you to the right opportunities.\n\nWelcome to School_B.",
