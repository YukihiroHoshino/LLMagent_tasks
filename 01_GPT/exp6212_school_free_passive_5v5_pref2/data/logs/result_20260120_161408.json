I’m especially drawn to your academic expectations and the kind of student culture you build. If you still have your seat available, I’d like to formally apply and be considered this round.",
              "thought": "School_A is my #2 true choice (after School_E). At round 3, School_A is still unmatched and available, and only School_A and School_B remain unmatched, so securing School_A now is important. I have strong priority at School_A (they rank me #2, behind only Student_B). Student_B prefers School_E first and may already be matched elsewhere; even if not, applying now maximizes my chance to lock in a top outcome rather than risk being pushed to School_B or worse. Therefore I should apply immediately and signal clear commitment/fit."

We’re glad School_A is one of your very top choices, and your focus on high expectations and student culture aligns strongly with what we value. We’re pleased to offer you a place at School_A this round. Welcome—if you’d like, share the subjects you most want to strengthen so we can point you to the best supports from day one.",

Student_D also signals strong commitment to School_A, reducing risk of losing them to another school. Therefore, accept immediately."
