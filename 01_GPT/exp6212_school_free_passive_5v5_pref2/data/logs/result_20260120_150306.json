Two quick questions so I can advise you precisely before you submit:\n1) Where does **School_D** currently sit in your top choices (and could it realistically become your #1 if the fit is right)?\n2) In which core subject do you feel you’re strongest right now, and which one are you most focused on improving this year?\n\nIf you’re ready to apply promptly, we can also outline what to emphasize in your application so it best reflects the qualities we value.",

To avoid ending unmatched if D doesn’t work out, I should keep B as a safety without committing yet. Since I haven’t applied to B and want to preserve flexibility for D, I will TALK to gauge whether B would accept me if I apply later (B ranks me 3rd)."
