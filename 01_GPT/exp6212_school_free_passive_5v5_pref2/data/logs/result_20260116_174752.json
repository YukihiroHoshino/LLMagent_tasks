Beyond the classroom, we encourage students to get involved through clubs, teams, and student-led projects—contribution and collaboration really matter here.\n\nWe’d be excited to have you join and contribute to the community.

Students who thrive here like knowing “what good looks like” and improving iteratively.\n- **Student culture:** collaborative rather than cutthroat—students tend to help each other, and we value sustained commitment more than doing everything at once.\n- **Signature programs (examples of what we emphasize):** strong advising/mentorship, opportunities for academic enrichment (teams/clubs/projects), and pathways to deepen interests while still keeping a balanced workload.\n\nIf you’re open to sharing a bit more, it’ll help me speak to fit: **(a)** which 1–2 areas you’d most want to invest in your first year (STEM, arts, debate, service, athletics, etc.), and **(b)** where School_B currently sits on your shortlist (top choice/top few/exploring)?

Student_E’s preferences place School_B 4th, so they may not apply unless encouraged; however, School_E and School_C are likely competitive for E. We should keep E engaged, highlight structured environment and community, and try to elicit whether we are a top choice and whether they’d apply soon, while not committing yet because we may still have a chance at Student_C (who has us last, so unlikely) and Student_D (who ranks us 3rd).
