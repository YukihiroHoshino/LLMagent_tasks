Extracurriculars help most when they demonstrate depth and perseverance.\n\n**Academic support for top exam performance:**\n- **Advisor + study plan**: each student is paired with an advisor who helps set weekly targets and keeps a structured plan (including review cycles).\n- **Diagnostics & targeted remediation**: regular timed sets and mock exams, followed by skill-by-skill weak-point mapping and focused practice.\n- **Small-group/1:1 support when needed**: short, intensive clinics around common bottlenecks (e.g., geometry proofs, reading inference, writing structure) and optional tutoring.\n- **Strategy coaching**: pacing, question selection, and “what to do when stuck,” plus structured error logs to prevent repeat mistakes.\n\n**Signature programs/mentoring:**\n- **Mock-exam + debrief cycle** (our signature): full-length practice under exam conditions, then guided debrief sessions that teach you how to convert mistakes into a concrete next-week plan.\n- **High-achiever mentoring**: periodic check-ins with senior students/alumni who share routines, materials, and study systems that worked for them.\n\nTo tailor this: which entrance exams/schools are you targeting, and which subject do you most want to raise (math, English, science, or writing)?
