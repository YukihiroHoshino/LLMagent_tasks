Students who thrive here tend to *raise the room* rather than try to “win” it.\n- **They use support early and often.** Faculty office hours, peer tutoring/study circles, and advisor check-ins are common. The students who struggle most are usually the ones who go silent when something gets hard.\n- **They’re consistent community contributors.** Reliability matters—showing up, following through, mentoring younger students, and taking feedback well.\n\n**(2) Areas we’re especially hoping to grow next year**\nWhile we’ll support many paths, we’re particularly looking to expand:\n- **Student-led academic support** (peer tutoring, structured study groups, subject societies) with students who can organize and sustain it.\n- **Project-based clubs with real deliverables** (research/engineering/design/community-impact projects) where students take ownership of planning and execution.\n- **Bridge leadership roles** (club officers, event leads, team captains) for students who can coordinate people—not just participate.\n\nTo help you assess fit *and* so I can point you to the best match inside School_B, two quick questions:\n1) In a rigorous week, what’s your typical approach when you hit a topic you don’t understand right away—do you prefer office hours, peer study, independent review, or a mix?\n2) If you joined School_B, which contribution would you be most excited to commit to for a full year: **peer tutoring**, **leading a study group**, **building a project team**, or **running events for a club/community program**?\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: where does School_B sit on your list right now (top choice vs. one of a few), and what would you need to see to feel ready to submit an application?",
