What matters isn’t name-dropping a track, but showing you understand what you’d do here and how you’d contribute.\n\nIf you’re open to it, could you send a brief (5–7 sentence) snapshot covering: (a) your strongest subject(s) + one challenge you worked through, (b) your most meaningful activity and impact, and (c) where School_B sits among your remaining choices and whether you’d be ready to apply if we invite an application this round?
