If possible, could you also share what would make a candidate a strong fit for School_B?",

It’s acceptable as a fallback, but I should not apply immediately because I may have better chances at School_C (though I’m low priority there) and School_A/School_D. Also, School_B’s priority ranks me 4th (behind A, B, C), so if those students apply, I could be rejected. Best move now is to TALK to keep the option open, signal interest, and gather info before committing an APPLY."

At School_B we look for students who are academically curious, consistent in their effort, and who contribute positively to a community (reliability, collaboration, and initiative matter a lot).\n\nProgram emphasis:\n- Academics: strong core instruction with structured support (regular feedback, office hours/extra help, and clear expectations). We value growth and sustained performance over “one-off” results.\n- Clubs & activities: we encourage students to take ownership—starting projects, leading teams, and participating consistently rather than trying to do everything at once.\n- Student support: close advising and check-ins; we want students to feel comfortable asking for help early.\n\nA “strong fit” for School_B is someone who can describe (1) what they want to explore here (a subject interest or goal), (2) how they handle challenges/seek support, and (3) how they’ll engage beyond the classroom (even in a small but steady way).\n\nTo help you evaluate fit: what are your top academic interests right now, and what kind of environment helps you do your best (more independent vs. more structured)?",
              "thought": "Student_E is on our true priority list (4th of 5), so worth engaging but not committing yet. Student_E ranks School_B 4th, so they are unlikely to apply immediately; we should differentiate our program and learn what they want, while keeping capacity open for higher-priority Student_A/Student_B if they become available. Since the student sent [TALK], respond with [TALK] and encourage an application if fit is strong."

However, rejecting Student_A risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students do not apply or are matched elsewhere.
