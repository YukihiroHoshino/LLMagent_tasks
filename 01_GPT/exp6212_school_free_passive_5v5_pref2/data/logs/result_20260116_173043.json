If there’s any final information you need from me (academic details, activities, or fit), I’m happy to provide it right away.",

I have only talked so far and not applied. Given School_A’s priority ranks me 3rd (behind Student_B and Student_D), but those students likely matched elsewhere already since only School_A is left. Therefore applying now is optimal to lock in a placement."
