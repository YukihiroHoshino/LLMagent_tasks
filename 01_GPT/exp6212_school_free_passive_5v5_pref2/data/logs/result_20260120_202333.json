We look for steady performance and/or clear improvement over time, plus good learning habits (meeting deadlines, seeking help early).\n2) Initiative with follow-through: one or two sustained commitments where you took real ownership (leading a team, organizing, building something, tutoring, competition prep, long-term service, family/work responsibility). Depth and completion matter more than a long list.\n3) Character & community values: reliability, respect, and collaboration. The students who stand out are those other people trust—good teammates, calm under pressure, and willing to support peers.\n\nStudents who thrive most at School_A typically:\n- Want rigor but also use support proactively (office hours/tutoring/study halls).\n- Prefer a goal-oriented environment (clear expectations, steady workload).\n- Like contributing to clubs/teams in meaningful ways rather than just “joining.”\n\nIf you apply, what to emphasize:\n- One concrete example of sustained effort + measurable impact (role, duration, outcomes).\n- A brief story of growth (a setback or weakness you improved through specific actions).\n- Specific School_A programs you’d actually use (e.g., STEM projects/capstone, competition prep, leadership/service) and how they connect to your goals.\n\nTo tailor guidance: what’s the single commitment you’re most proud of (and what was your exact role), and where does School_A sit among your top choices right now if you had to rank it?
