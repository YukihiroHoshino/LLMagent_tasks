We don’t require “perfect,” but we do look for evidence you can handle consistent rigor.\n- Initiative: students who take ownership—seeking help early, leading or building something (club role, team responsibility, peer tutoring, personal projects).\n- Character & community: reliability, integrity, and how you collaborate. We notice students who contribute to the room, not just their own results.\n\nOpportunities first-year students commonly jump into:\n- Academic supports early (teacher office hours, structured study sessions) to set strong habits from the start\n- Clubs/teams with clear entry points for 9th/10th graders (so you can build community quickly)\n- Honors/advanced track “on-ramp” classes and skill workshops (study skills, writing, problem-solving)\n\nSupport for advanced coursework & competitions:\n- Placement + acceleration planning: we map your starting point in the first weeks and create a plan for honors/advanced courses (and when to move up) based on performance and readiness.\n- Coaching & mentorship: faculty advisors for competition groups (e.g., math/science/writing) plus structured prep schedules.\n- Progress monitoring: frequent feedback and check-ins so acceleration doesn’t become overwhelming; we intervene early with targeted tutoring if needed.\n\nTo help me advise you precisely: which advanced path are you most interested in (e.g., honors math/science, writing/debate, Olympiad-style competitions), and what would need to be true for School_A to move higher on your list? If you tell me your top 1–2 priorities, I can map the exact first-year plan you’d likely follow here.",
