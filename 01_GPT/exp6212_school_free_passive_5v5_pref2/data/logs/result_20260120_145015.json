I’m interested in keeping School_B as a serious option and would appreciate any details you can share.",

However, School_B ranks me 2nd (after Student_A), so it can be a solid fallback if my top choices fill. Best move is to TALK to keep the option warm without locking in a lower-ranked match."

We prioritize students who show strong academic readiness, consistent effort over time, and a clear fit with our community (collaboration, curiosity, and follow-through). School_B’s strengths are:\n- Rigorous core academics with structured support (office hours/tutoring) so motivated students can push further.\n- Strong student community and advising: we focus on helping students set goals early and stay on track.\n- Breadth of activities and leadership opportunities—students who want to contribute can find a place quickly.\n\nTo help you evaluate fit: what are you most focused on in high school (advanced academics, specific subjects, clubs/leadership, support structure, campus culture)? Also, where does School_B currently sit on your shortlist relative to your other options? If you decide School_B is a top choice, I encourage you to apply—we’re very interested in you.",
              "thought": "Student_B is #2 on School_B's true priority list, so I should actively appeal and keep them engaged. They are currently just TALKing, so I cannot accept yet.
