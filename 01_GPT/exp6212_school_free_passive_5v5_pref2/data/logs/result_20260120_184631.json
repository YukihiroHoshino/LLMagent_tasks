The learning style is discussion + structured practice: you’ll get clear expectations and frequent feedback, and students who proactively ask questions, revise work, and use office hours/advisory time tend to thrive. If you like being challenged but also like knowing “what good looks like,” it’s usually a strong fit.\n\n2) Decision timeline: We have one seat and we do consider applications as they come in. That said, we’re open to continued conversation for a short window rather than forcing an immediate decision after one chat—especially if you’re still comparing fit. Practically, if you decide School_A is a top choice for you, applying sooner improves the chance we can move forward before the seat is filled.\n\nTo help you decide well: what’s your typical work style (steady pacing vs. bursts), and what are your top 2–3 schools right now?
