We also value reliability and contribution to the community—students who follow through and engage constructively.\n\nTo help you decide whether School_C is a good match: what are you prioritizing most (e.g., advanced coursework, extracurricular depth, academic support, school culture)?

I remain ready to commit to School_B immediately if you can take me.\n\nCan you please tell me plainly whether you can accept Student_D now, or whether you are holding the seat for a higher-priority student (especially Student_A / Student_B / Student_C / Student_E)? If you’re waiting for them, I’ll redirect to School_A right away; if not, I’d like to secure the match with you as soon as you’re able.",

I already applied earlier; I should not re-apply, but use TALK to push for a clear yes/no and, if possible, get them to accept now rather than hold the seat. If they won’t accept, my best remaining option is School_A where I have relatively high priority (2nd), so I need quick clarity to pivot."

With only one seat, we can’t responsibly commit it to you while that possibility is still live.\n\nGiven that, I don’t want you to lose time: **you should redirect to School_A this round** if that’s your best remaining path.\n\nIf you want a clean re-entry condition: **if you learn Student_A has matched elsewhere**, message us immediately with **[APPLY]** and we’ll respond right away based solely on whether the seat is still open at that moment.\n",
