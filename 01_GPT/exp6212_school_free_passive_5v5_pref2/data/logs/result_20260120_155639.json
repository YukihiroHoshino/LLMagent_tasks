If accepted, I’m prepared to enroll and commit fully to your expectations. [APPLY]",

I already applied to School_C (my top), but C’s priority ranks me 4th, and Student_B/Student_A/Student_D are ahead and may compete for C, so that match is uncertain. School_A is my 2nd choice but A’s priority ranks me last, so unlikely. School_B’s priority ranks me 4th as well, but Student_A/B/C are ahead; still, it’s a viable fallback if those students end up matched elsewhere. Since I haven’t applied to B yet and time is limited, I should apply now to secure a chance rather than only talking."

If you’re actively comparing a couple schools, tell us the **specific decision date** you’d need (e.g., “by next Tuesday”), and we can often accommodate a **short, clearly defined extension** as long as our seat is still available.\n\n3) **What we’d want to see to move quickly:** If you want the fastest decision on our side, the most helpful items are:\n- A **complete application** (so we’re not waiting on pieces), and\n- A brief note (5–8 sentences is fine) on **why School_A specifically** fits you (courses/programs/community) plus **one concrete example** of impact/initiative in an activity or project.\n\nOne direct question so we can be efficient: **Which 1–2 schools are you comparing against, and what are the deciding criteria for you?** If you share that, I can also tell you candidly whether School_A is likely to be a strong fit and how quickly we could finalize if you apply.",
