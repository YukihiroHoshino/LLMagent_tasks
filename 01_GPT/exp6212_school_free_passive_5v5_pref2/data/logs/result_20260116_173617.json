I want to be direct: School_C is one of my very top choices, and I’m excited about the academic culture and community you described. I’m ready to commit and would be thrilled to join if admitted. Please consider this my formal application—happy to share any additional details you’d like (interests, activities, or what I’d contribute on campus). [APPLY]",

Student_B has School_C as #2 and is School_C’s top priority; Student_A has School_C as #5 but is #2 priority; Student_D has School_C as #5 but is #3 priority; Student_E has School_C as #1 and is #4 priority. So School_C will likely fill with B or E if they apply. Since I haven’t applied anywhere yet and School_C is still unmatched, I should apply now to keep a live option rather than risk missing out while waiting for School_D (where I’m #2 priority and it’s my #1 choice). Applying to School_C now is safe because if rejected I can pivot to School_D/E later; if accepted I secure a high-ranked match."

Student_B prefers School_E then School_C; likely to apply to School_E first, where School_E ranks Student_B second behind Student_E. Student_E is unmatched and may apply to School_E, potentially taking priority over Student_B there; however Student_E already applied to us and was rejected, suggesting they may pursue other schools. There is a chance Student_B becomes available to us later, so accepting Student_C now could block a higher-priority match. But we cannot guarantee Student_B will apply to us in time or be rejected elsewhere. Given Student_C is on our list and is applying with commitment, and we risk ending unmatched if we wait, accept Student_C."
