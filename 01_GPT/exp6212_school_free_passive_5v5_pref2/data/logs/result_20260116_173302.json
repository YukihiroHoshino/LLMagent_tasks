We also look for students who can explain how they learn—study habits, how they handle setbacks, and how they seek help.\n- Activities/initiative: depth over quantity. Leadership is great, but so is sustained commitment (e.g., sticking with a club/team/project and taking on real responsibility). Starting something small—tutoring, a project, an event—also stands out.\n- Character & fit: reliability, curiosity, and how you contribute to a community. We notice students who communicate respectfully, collaborate well, and take ownership when things get hard.\n\nFirst-year experience & support:\n- Advising/check-ins: new students typically have structured check-ins early on to make sure workload, routines, and course placement are on track.\n- Academic support: teacher office hours/extra help are built into the rhythm of the week, and we encourage students to use support early rather than waiting.\n- Community integration: we intentionally help first-years plug into clubs/teams and peer groups; many students find their footing quickly through activities.\n\nTo help you assess fit concretely: what subjects or activities are you most excited to pursue next year, and what kind of support helps you most (frequent check-ins vs. more independence)?
