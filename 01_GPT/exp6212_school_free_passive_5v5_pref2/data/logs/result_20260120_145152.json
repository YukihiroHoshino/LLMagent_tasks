Importantly, School_E ranks me #1 in its priority list, so if I apply I will almost certainly be accepted and lock in a guaranteed match. However, applying now would prevent me from pursuing higher true preferences (School_C, School_A, School_D, School_B) where my priority is weaker (C ranks me 4th, A ranks me 5th, D ranks me 4th, B ranks me 4th). Since this is round 1 and I have no history, I should not lock in my worst option yet; instead, I should keep School_E as a safe fallback while I try for better schools in upcoming rounds. Therefore I will TALK to maintain interest without committing."

I’m glad you’re keeping School_E in mind.\n\nSchool_E’s strongest features are:\n1) Strong academic support with high expectations: small classes and structured help (office hours/tutoring) so motivated students can push into advanced work without getting lost.\n2) A tight-knit community: students tend to know their teachers well, and we put a lot of emphasis on mentorship and belonging—especially for students who want to grow their confidence.\n3) Balance of rigor and student life: we encourage involvement (clubs/activities) alongside academics, and we look for students who are curious, consistent, and willing to engage.\n\nStudents who thrive here are typically those who like clear goals, are open to feedback, and want a community where effort is noticed.\n\nTo help you evaluate fit: what matters most to you right now—academic challenge, specific subjects (STEM/humanities), extracurriculars, school culture, or support/mentoring? And what kind of environment helps you do your best work?",
