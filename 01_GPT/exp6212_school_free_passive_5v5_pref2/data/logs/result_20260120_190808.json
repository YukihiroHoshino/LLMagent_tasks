Advisors also coordinate with teachers if a student is overloaded or needs a plan.\n- **Tutoring & office hours:** predictable weekly teacher office hours plus peer tutoring; we also do early progress flags so support starts before grades slip.\n- **Counseling & wellbeing:** counselors are available for both academic planning and personal support; students can self-refer, and advisors can help connect you quickly.\n- **“No one falls through the cracks” routines:** consistent check-ins, clear communication channels, and concrete action plans (not just “try harder”).\n\n**Qualities that stand out in students who thrive at School_E**\n- **Steady self-management:** they use planners/systems, communicate early, and can balance multiple classes.\n- **Curiosity + follow-through:** they ask good questions and finish what they start (projects, clubs, community commitments).\n- **Comfort with feedback:** they revise work and treat feedback as a tool, not a judgment.\n- **Positive community habits:** reliable teammate, respectful in discussion, contributes to the culture.\n\nIf you tell me **(1)** your strongest subjects, **(2)** what kind of environment you learn best in (structured vs. flexible), and **(3)** what support you value most (tutoring, advising, counseling, or challenge), I can be very candid about fit—and point you to the specific programs you’d plug into here.\n\nIf School_E is moving up your list, I’d genuinely encourage you to **apply** when you’re ready so we can treat this as a serious candidacy and reserve time to support your decision.",

We can’t hold the seat based on interest alone.\n\nTo help you decide (and to understand your fit), two quick questions:\n- Where does School_D rank among your remaining choices—are we a top choice if you get an offer?\n- What kind of day-to-day support matters most to you (academic planning, tutoring, mentoring/check-ins, or something else)?",
