You’d map the current process, identify the top bottlenecks, and ship 1–2 improvements (could be automation, better tooling, or a revised operating cadence) with measurable impact.\n- Project 2 (weeks 6–12): Lead an expansion/second phase based on what you learn—either scaling the improvement across teams or owning a larger initiative that reduces cycle time and improves stakeholder visibility (e.g., dashboards/SLAs, tighter handoffs, clearer prioritization).\n\n2) What “great performance” looks like by day 90\n- You’re independently driving a priority area end-to-end with minimal hand-holding.\n- Measurable results: a concrete improvement shipped (or multiple smaller ones) that moves a metric (cycle time, defect rate/quality, throughput, or stakeholder satisfaction).\n- Predictable execution: crisp weekly written updates, early risk flags, and strong cross-functional coordination.\n- You’ve identified and proposed the next 1–2 highest-leverage opportunities with a clear plan.\n\n3) Must-have skills/experiences we screen for\n- Demonstrated ownership: examples where you led ambiguous work to delivery and can explain tradeoffs.\n- Strong written communication and stakeholder management (status, alignment, expectation setting).\n- Ability to ramp quickly in a new domain and create structure (plans, milestones, metrics).\n\nIf this sounds aligned, the fastest next step is: reply with (a) one example of a fast ramp (what you shipped in the first 30 days), (b) the type of work you most want to own in the first 90 days, and (c) any constraints/timeline.
