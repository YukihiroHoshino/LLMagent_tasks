Your focus on clear ownership, reliable execution, and cross-functional collaboration is exactly what we need.\n\nWhat we’re prioritizing most right now:\n- End-to-end ownership: taking a project from ambiguous problem → scoped plan → stakeholder alignment → delivery and iteration.\n- Crisp cross-functional communication: proactive updates, surfacing risks/tradeoffs early, and driving decisions to closure.\n- Execution cadence: ability to set an operating rhythm (weekly milestones, clear owners, measurable outcomes).\n\nDecision timeline: we’re moving quickly and can confirm next steps immediately. We’ll follow up right away with the onboarding/start-date logistics.\n\nWelcome aboard.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_B and Seeker_D remain unmatched. Our true priority ranks Seeker_D (4th) above Seeker_E but below A/B/C. Seeker_A/C already matched elsewhere; Seeker_B is still available and is our #2, so ideally we’d wait for Seeker_B. However, Seeker_D has Company_D as top choice and is applying now; if we reject, we risk ending unmatched if Seeker_B matches with Company_A/C/B (all rank seekers identically and may accept). Given the small remaining market and Seeker_D’s strong interest, accept to secure a match rather than gamble for Seeker_B."
