You’ll meet key partners, learn our roadmap and customer pain points, and take ownership of a small but real deliverable to get shipping quickly.\n- Days 31–60: lead your first major project. You’ll propose a plan, get buy-in, and drive execution with measurable milestones.\n- Days 61–90: expand scope and show repeatable impact. We’ll look for clear results, improved processes, and a roadmap for the next quarter that you can own.\n\nTo map your strengths well: what role type are you targeting (e.g., product, engineering, ops, data), and can you share 1–2 examples of (a) a fast ramp you’ve done and (b) a project where you drove measurable impact across stakeholders?
