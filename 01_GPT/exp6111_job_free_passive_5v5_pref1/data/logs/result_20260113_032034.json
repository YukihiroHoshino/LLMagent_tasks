Based on what I understand about the role, I can ramp quickly and deliver impact early (clear execution, strong collaboration, and ownership). If selected, I’m ready to commit and start the process right away. Could you share the single most important outcome you want the hire to achieve in the first 60–90 days so I can align my plan accordingly?",

All companies share the same priority order with Seeker_A ranked above me, so if Seeker_A is still unmatched and applies, I could be displaced; therefore I should apply immediately and emphasize fit and readiness to commit."

Next step would be a quick kickoff to confirm scope/metrics and then proceed through our interview loop.\n\n[ACTION] [ACCEPT]",
