You’ll also co-write a 60–90 day plan with your manager.\n- **Months 2–3 (first major deliverable):** take end-to-end ownership of a core project (scoping, execution, stakeholder alignment). Expect at least one meaningful launch or rollout with measurable impact.\n- **Months 4–6 (expand scope):** move from “project owner” to “area owner”—driving a roadmap, mentoring/collaborating across functions, and establishing repeatable metrics and operating cadence.\n\n**Success metrics we use:**\n- Delivery: hitting milestones with high-quality execution (reliability, maintainability, low rework).\n- Impact: measurable movement in the KPI your project targets (we define it up front).\n- Ownership: proactively identifying risks/tradeoffs, communicating clearly, and unblocking others.\n- Collaboration: strong stakeholder management and crisp written updates.\n\n**Qualities we prioritize most:**\n- High ownership and bias to action (you don’t wait to be told what to do).\n- Structured problem-solving and comfort with ambiguity.\n- Clear communication (especially written) and pragmatic decision-making.\n- Growth mindset: you seek feedback and iterate quickly.\n\nTo gauge fit on both sides: what kind of “ownership” are you looking for (greenfield vs. improving an existing system/process), and what’s the top growth area you want in your next role?

If you’re already far along elsewhere, we can **compress to ~7–10 days**.\n\n2) **What makes a candidate an immediate “yes”:**\n- **Clear ownership:** you’ve driven an ambiguous project end-to-end and can articulate decisions/tradeoffs.\n- **Structured problem solving:** you break down messy problems, prioritize well, and show strong judgment.\n- **Communication & stakeholder management:** crisp written/async updates, proactive alignment, and reliability.\n- **Evidence of impact:** measurable outcomes (speed, quality, revenue, cost, customer metrics) and learning loops.\n\n3) **Can we move to an offer quickly with strong mutual fit?** Yes. If interviews are strong and references check out, we can move to an offer **immediately after the final round** (often within **24–48 hours**), especially if you have competing deadlines.\n\nTo help us stay aligned: what’s your **decision window** on the other roles (e.g., any expected final rounds/offers), and what would you need to see from Company_E for us to become a top option for you?",
