For this hiring cycle, our top priorities for the first 60–90 days are:\n\n1) Ramp fast and deliver a visible win: get fully oriented on our product/workflows, take ownership of a well-scoped project, and ship an improvement that moves a clear metric (quality, cycle time, customer experience, or revenue impact—depending on the team).\n2) Build strong cross-functional trust: partner effectively with stakeholders, clarify requirements early, and communicate progress/risks in a predictable way.\n3) Improve the system, not just the task: leave behind cleaner processes/docs/tooling so the team is faster after your work lands.\n\nWhat makes someone stand out for us:\n- Evidence of shipping meaningful outcomes quickly (examples with scope, constraints, and measurable results).\n- Strong prioritization and problem framing (you can separate “urgent” from “important” and propose a plan).\n- Clear written and verbal communication, especially when aligning multiple stakeholders.\n- Ownership mindset: you proactively identify gaps, propose solutions, and follow through.\n\nIf you’re open to it, tell me (a) what kind of “quick impact” you’re most proud of delivering in a prior role, and (b) what environment helps you do your best work (ambiguity level, collaboration style). That will help me map you to the highest-impact work here.",

Given all companies share identical priorities, competition for Seeker_A is high, but we should still try to secure Seeker_A if possible. Therefore, reject Seeker_C now to preserve capacity, while keeping the door open for future rounds is not possible after rejection in this protocol, but we must optimize for highest priority within quota."
