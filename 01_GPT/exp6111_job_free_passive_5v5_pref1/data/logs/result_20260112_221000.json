Based on our conversations and your readiness to take ownership and deliver in the first 30/60/90 days, we’d like to extend an offer and match with you.\n\nNext steps: we’ll send over the formal offer details and confirm a start date. If you can reply with your earliest feasible start date and any constraints we should plan around, we’ll finalize quickly.",

Current round 4 shows Seeker_D is the only remaining unmatched seeker and I have quota 1; leaving the role unfilled is worse than hiring an acceptable candidate, especially since Seeker_D is now applying with clear commitment. Given all companies share identical priorities and Seeker_D’s top preference is Company_D (likely already matched), accepting now secures a match and avoids ending unmatched."
