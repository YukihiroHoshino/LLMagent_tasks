Domain expertise can help but isn’t required; what matters more is (a) ownership in ambiguity, (b) comfort using data to make decisions, and (c) stakeholder management/writing clarity. People who can independently drive a workstream, unblock others, and communicate tradeoffs early tend to thrive.\n\nTimeline to offers\nWe’re moving quickly this cycle. If there’s mutual fit, we can get to a decision within ~1–2 weeks from an application, and we’re able to accelerate for candidates who are already late-stage elsewhere.\n\nTo calibrate and make this worthwhile for you: where are you in your process with Company_A/Company_C/Company_B, and what would make Company_D a top choice for you (scope, mentorship, comp, flexibility, mission)?",
