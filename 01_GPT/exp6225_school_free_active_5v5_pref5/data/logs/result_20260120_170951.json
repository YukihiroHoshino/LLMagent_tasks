Since Student_B’s top choice is School_A, there is a good chance Student_B applies to School_A first, making School_C a strong and realistic target for an early secure match while still very high on my true preference list.

Student_B’s preferences place School_C as 3rd, but their message indicates readiness to commit if accepted; given the mechanism, an [ACCEPT] upon [APPLY] finalizes the match, so taking Student_B now is optimal. Student_C is ranked below Student_B, so even if Student_B were uncertain, holding out would risk losing the top choice without improving beyond Student_B."

However, Student_E (my top choice) and Student_B/C (also higher than D) have not contacted me yet; given quota=1, accepting D now would block a higher-priority match if one applies later. Still, I can only respond to Student_D now; with no guarantee higher-priority students will apply to me (Student_E prefers School_C first and ranks School_B last; Student_B prefers School_A first; Student_C prefers School_B first), there is some chance Student_C will apply soon, making waiting valuable. But rejecting D risks ending up with A or nobody if others don't apply.
