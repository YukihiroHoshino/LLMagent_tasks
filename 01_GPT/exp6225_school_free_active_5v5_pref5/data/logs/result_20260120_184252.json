A great fit is someone who can articulate what they want to explore here and how they’ll contribute to classmates and school life.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what subjects or programs are you most excited about at School_C, and what’s one activity or project you’ve pursued deeply? Also, where does School_C sit among your top choices right now?",

Although Student_E and Student_B are higher priorities, neither has applied to me this round; also Student_E prefers School_C/D/A/E over me (School_B is last), and Student_B prefers School_A first, so waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked student later.
