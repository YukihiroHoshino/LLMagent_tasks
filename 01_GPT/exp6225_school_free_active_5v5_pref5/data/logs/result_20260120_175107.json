I’m writing once more because School_B remains my first choice by a wide margin, and if admitted I will immediately accept and enroll.\n\nIf you still have an open seat and are reconsidering candidates this round, I would be grateful to be considered again. I believe I would contribute positively to School_B’s academic culture through consistent effort, collaboration with classmates, and active participation in school life.\n\nThank you again for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_C",
              "thought": "Only School_B remains unmatched and it is my top true preference. Although I have been rejected twice, School_B has capacity 1 and may still be considering candidates. Since matching with School_B is my best possible outcome and I have no other active options, I will apply again with a concise update, clear commitment to enroll if admitted, and a respectful request to be reconsidered if a spot is still open."

We appreciate your persistence and the thoughtful way you’ve described how you would contribute to our academic community.\n\nWe are pleased to offer you admission to School_B. Please confirm that you accept and will enroll.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_B Admissions",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and no current match. Our true priority is E > B > C > D > A. Student_C is our #3, and they rank us #1, so accepting would likely lock in a stable match. However, Student_E (our #1) ranks School_B last, so unlikely to apply; Student_B (our #2) ranks us #2 and may apply later if rejected by School_A; holding out could yield Student_B, but there is risk we end unmatched if B never comes. Given repeated applications from C and no better candidates in the current inbox, accepting C now secures a high-priority, committed match."
