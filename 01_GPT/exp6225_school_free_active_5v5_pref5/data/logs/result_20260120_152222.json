School_C is my second choice and I also rank last there, but School_C is the top choice for Student_E and high for others, so it will be very competitive too. Since there is no cost to trying and early rounds matter, I will still approach my true first choice (School_B) and use [TALK] to signal strong interest and ask what they value, hoping to stand out if others do not apply or if they care about fit beyond priority. I avoid applying immediately to reduce the risk of an early rejection and to potentially tailor a stronger application next round."

However, Student_B and especially Student_E are higher priorities than C. Student_E does not rank School_B (puts it last), so unlikely to apply here early; Student_B ranks School_B second after School_A, so B may apply to A first and could still come to B later if rejected. If I accept C now, quota fills and I lose chance at B. But given School_A’s top priorities are E and D, Student_B may be rejected by A if E or D apply there; still uncertain. With only one seat, the safe strategy to maximize expected outcome is to keep the seat open for higher-ranked Student_B rather than lock in Student_C immediately. Since Student_C has applied, I must accept or reject; I will reject now to preserve capacity and encourage C to pursue next choices, while leaving door open if still unmatched later (though rules may prevent re-engagement; still, decision must be made)."

Student_E and Student_B have not contacted School_B this round and may be pursuing their higher choices (E prefers C/D/A/E/B; B prefers A first).
