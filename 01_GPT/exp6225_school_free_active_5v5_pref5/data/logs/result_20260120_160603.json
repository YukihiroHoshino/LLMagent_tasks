School_C is one of my top choices because I’m looking for a strong academic environment and a community where I can contribute consistently.

School_C is my #2 choice and also ranks me last, so I should first gather information and express strong interest without committing my one-shot application this round. Using [TALK] keeps flexibility while signaling fit and enthusiasm, and I can pivot to School_A (where I’m ranked higher) with an [APPLY] next round if needed."

At School_C, we look for students who will thrive in a rigorous academic setting and contribute to the community in a consistent, specific way.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants:\n- Academic readiness: strong fundamentals, intellectual curiosity, and evidence you can handle sustained challenge.\n- Fit and contribution: clear, concrete examples of how you’ll participate (clubs, leadership, service, peer support), not just broad interest.\n- Growth mindset: how you respond to setbacks and improve over time.\n\nHow to present your fit effectively:\n- Be specific: name 1–2 programs/areas at School_C you’re genuinely excited about and connect them to your past actions.\n- Use examples: a short story about a project, team role, or initiative you led/advanced is more persuasive than general statements.\n- Interview focus: communicate clearly, reflect thoughtfully, and show you’ve researched School_C beyond rankings.\n\nOne quick question so we can advise you better: where does School_C currently stand on your list (are you considering applying soon), and what 1–2 activities or academic interests best represent you?\n\n[TALK]",

Student_B’s top choice is School_A, so they may not apply to School_C first; Student_C will likely apply to School_B first. That makes School_C a plausible early win if I apply immediately.

Student_E ranks School_B last, so is unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere; Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply if not matched to School_A. Given the uncertainty and that we can only respond ACCEPT/REJECT to an APPLY, the choice is between securing a solid, high-ranked candidate now (#3) versus risking ending up with a lower-ranked candidate or an unfilled seat later.
