However, higher-priority students for us are Student_D, Student_A, and Student_C. From their preferences, School_D is not a top choice for Student_D (last), Student_A (last), or Student_C (3rd), so they may not apply soon, but there is still time (round 5 of 30) and accepting Student_E now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with any of the top three if they later apply. Given we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside the list (but Student_E is on the list), the key tradeoff is whether to wait for better-ranked candidates. With ample remaining rounds and no urgency signal that the market is about to end, the optimal strategy to maximize our match quality is to continue holding out for higher-priority applicants, so reject Student_E again."
