In round 1, only Student_C has applied to me, and Student_C lists School_B as first choice, so accepting would immediately fill my single quota with a reasonably high-priority student and secure a committed match. However, Student_E (my top choice) ranks School_B last and is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply if not accepted by School_A. There is some chance to improve by waiting for Student_B, but rejecting Student_C risks ending up unmatched if Student_B never comes. Given Student_C's strong interest and decent priority position, accepting is the safer strategy to ensure a good match within quota."

In a student-proposing dynamic, B will likely apply to A first and may be accepted by A (A prioritizes E then D then A then B), so B may not reach C; C and D will likely apply to B first and may be accepted by B (B prioritizes E then B then C then D), so they may not reach C either. Student_E ranks School_C 1st and is likely to be a strong, immediate, secure match. Accepting E now fills quota but avoids ending unmatched while waiting for higher-priority students who may never apply. Therefore accept Student_E."

We still have quota 1 and no other students are contacting us, but we have repeatedly stated we will hold for higher-priority candidates (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C, Student_E). There is no evidence those higher-priority students are unavailable for the remainder of the market; accepting B now would risk missing a higher-priority match if one appears in the final rounds. Since Student_B only sent [TALK], we should continue to communicate status and keep the plan for Round 26 application and Round 26–27 reassessment."
