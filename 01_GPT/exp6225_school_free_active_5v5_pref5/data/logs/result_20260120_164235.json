The strongest applications are specific: highlight 1–2 concrete examples where you took ownership, overcame a challenge, or led/served others, and connect those experiences to what you hope to do at School_B.\n\nIf you’d like to be formally considered for a seat, please send an [APPLY] message when you’re ready, and include 2–3 key strengths/activities you’d want us to weigh most heavily.",

C ranks School_B first and is applying now, providing a secure match with a mid-high priority (3rd). Given uncertainty about receiving E or B, and D being lower than C and not applying, accepting C now maximizes expected outcome and secures the seat."

While School_E is my 4th choice, locking it in avoids the risk of ending up at my 5th choice (School_D) or unmatched if I chase School_B/School_C where my priority is weak.

Accepting now secures my top-choice student; waiting risks losing them to other schools they rank higher (School_B, School_C, School_A) if they later apply there and are accepted. No higher-ranked candidate than Student_A exists for me, so immediate acceptance is optimal."
