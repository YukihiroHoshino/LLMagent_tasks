That means higher-priority students for School_C are likely to pursue other schools first, and may never apply to School_C (or may only do so after rejections). Meanwhile, Student_E has School_C as first choice and is applying immediately, giving high certainty of filling our single seat with an acceptable student. Given the one-seat quota and uncertainty of receiving applications from B/C/D soon (or at all), accepting Student_E now secures a match with a student on our priority list rather than risking ending unmatched."

Student_A is my lowest-ranked acceptable student, so to maximize my outcome I should reject Student_A and keep the seat available for a higher-priority applicant. Also, Student_B prefers School_A first, so they may not end up at B, but I still have Student_C and Student_D (both rank above A for me) applying and listing School_B as first choice, so I can likely secure a better match than A by rejecting now."
