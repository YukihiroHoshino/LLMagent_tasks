Given students' preferences, Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and may come later; Student_A and Student_D rank School_D last so are unlikely, but still possible if rejected elsewhere.

We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so we can wait for higher-priority candidates (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C) to apply in later rounds. Student_E has applied multiple times, but accepting now would forgo the chance to match with a higher-priority student if they approach us later. Since we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside the list, but Student_E is on the list, we could accept; however, to maximize our objective (highest possible on the priority list), we should continue to hold out at this stage. Therefore, reject again this round."

However, by round 6 the only remaining active school appears to be School_D, and Student_E is the only student contacting us; we have no matched students and one seat. Holding out risks ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply. Given the market state and repeated demonstrated commitment from Student_E to enroll immediately, accepting now secures a filled seat with an acceptable candidate rather than risking an unfilled outcome."
