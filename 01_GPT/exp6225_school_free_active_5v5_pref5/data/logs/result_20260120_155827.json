Student_C is currently applying and is my 3rd choice—acceptable, but I should consider whether I can realistically secure Student_E or Student_B if I wait. Student_E’s preferences rank School_B last, so it’s very unlikely they will apply to me early (or at all) unless rejected everywhere else. Student_B ranks School_B second but ranks School_A first; School_A’s top priorities are E and D ahead of B, so Student_B might get rejected by School_A and then apply to me, but that is uncertain and could take multiple rounds. I have a quota of 1 and an immediate solid applicant (Student_C) who ranks me first, meaning they will commit and reduce risk of ending unmatched. Given the uncertainty of attracting Student_B and the low likelihood of Student_E, accepting Student_C now maximizes expected outcome while still being high on my list."
