Those students also rank School_C highly (B has it 3rd, C has it 2nd, D has it 2nd), so competition is strong and an early application is likely to be rejected. My 2nd choice School_D ranks me 4th as well, but crucially the higher-priority students at School_D (Student_D and Student_A) both rank School_D last, and Student_C ranks it 3rd. That makes School_D a much more realistic path to a high-preference match for me. Therefore I should apply to School_D immediately to try to lock it in before others pivot there."

Given students' preferences, Student_D ranks School_D last and Student_A ranks School_D last, so they are unlikely to apply here early (or at all). Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and may apply later, but is not guaranteed. Student_E ranks School_D 2nd and has already applied in round 1, making them a strong, likely-to-match candidate. Accepting now secures a filled seat with an acceptable student and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for higher-priority students who may never apply."

Student_A and Student_D also rank School_B first, and Student_B ranks it second, so competition is high. However, applying immediately is best because if Student_E applies to School_B I will likely be rejected anyway; if Student_E goes elsewhere, applying early gives me a chance to secure my top option before the seat is taken. I will send a strong, direct application emphasizing fit and commitment."

I have quota 1 and an acceptance creates an immediate match, removing me from further negotiation; however, holding out for Student_E or Student_B is risky because neither has contacted me yet and they may prefer/secure other schools (Student_B ranks School_A first; Student_E ranks School_B last). Given the current inbox, accepting Student_C maximizes my outcome among available applicants and avoids the risk of ending unmatched."
