Student_B (my #2) prefers School_A first and may apply to me later if not accepted there. If I accept C now, I forgo any chance to take B later; but given C is applying now and is my #3, and there is no way to hold/wait under the rules (must accept or reject on APPLY), accepting C secures a high-priority match rather than risking ending up with D/A or unfilled.
