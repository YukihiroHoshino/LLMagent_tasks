However, I have quota 1 and may still receive an application from Student_E (my top choice) in a later round; Student_E does not rank School_B highly (last), but could be rejected elsewhere and later apply. Also Student_B ranks School_B second and might apply if not accepted by School_A. Still, I cannot hold a seat without accepting someone, and rejecting Student_C risks losing a high-ranked candidate who has School_B as first choice.
