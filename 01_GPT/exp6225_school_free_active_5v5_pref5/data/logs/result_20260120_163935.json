Although Student_D also applied, they are ranked below Student_B. There is no strategic benefit to delaying since Student_B may be accepted by School_A or School_B if I reject or stall, and I cannot improve beyond Student_B on my list. Therefore, accept Student_B now."

Those higher-priority students also tend to like School_B highly, so applying there now is likely to be rejected and wastes a round. My #2 choice School_C ranks me 3rd (behind Student_B and Student_C). Student_B’s first choice is School_A, so they may not apply to School_C immediately; Student_C’s first choice is School_B, so they may also go elsewhere first.

In contrast, I am ranked 1st at School_A and also have School_A as my 3rd true choice, making it a very safe way to secure a strong match immediately before capacity fills.

Additionally, Student_E (our top choice) ranks School_B last, so unlikely to apply, and Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply later if not accepted by School_A.

Student_C is ranked higher than Student_A, so if I must choose among current applicants, C is preferable. However, Student_E (my top choice) and Student_B (second) have not applied to me this round; Student_E ranks me last and likely won’t apply, while Student_B ranks School_A first and may or may not come to me later. Given the rules: a match is finalized upon [ACCEPT], so accepting Student_C now could forgo a potential later match with Student_B. Still, there is no mechanism to hold/wait on an [APPLY]—I must accept or reject. Considering Student_C has School_B as first choice and would commit immediately, and the likelihood that Student_B ends up at School_A, accepting Student_C is a strong, safe outcome that is high on my priority list (3rd)."
