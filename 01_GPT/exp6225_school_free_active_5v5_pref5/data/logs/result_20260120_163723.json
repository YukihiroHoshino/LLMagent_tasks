School_D is my 2nd choice and ranks me 4th as well. By contrast, School_A is my 3rd choice but ranks me 1st, meaning an early application should be accepted immediately and lock in a solid outcome rather than risking rejection and ending up with a worse school later. Therefore I will apply to School_A now to secure a match."

Accepting now secures our top-choice student and avoids the risk of losing them to another school (Student_E ranks School_A 3rd but could match elsewhere if not accepted). No higher-priority candidate exists, so immediate acceptance is optimal."

I am relatively high in School_B’s priority list (behind Student_E and Student_B), and delaying could let higher-ranked students take the only seat. An early, clear application maximizes my chance to secure my first choice before competition resolves elsewhere."

Although Student_E (my top) and Student_B (second) have not contacted me yet, I only have quota 1 and can secure a relatively high-priority match now by accepting C. Waiting risks losing Student_C to another school (C ranks School_B first, but could be taken if dynamics change), while D and A are lower priority for me. Therefore, accept Student_C now to lock in a better outcome than accepting D or A, even if it forecloses a chance at E or B later."
