Given others’ preferences and other schools’ priorities, there is a plausible path that Student_C may later apply to School_D if rejected elsewhere, and Student_D/Student_A are unlikely to apply since they place School_D last. Still, keeping the seat open preserves optionality for Student_C (and possibly Student_D if displaced). Round 2 is early, so reject Student_E to wait for higher-priority candidates; risk is ending unmatched if no one better applies, but with 30 rounds and potential rejections elsewhere, waiting is justified."
