School_C is my 2nd choice and ranks me 3rd (behind Student_B, Student_C), and Student_B’s top choice is School_A while Student_C’s top choice is School_B, so School_C may be more attainable early.

In this round I have applications from Student_D and Student_A; D is ranked above A, so if I must decide now, D is the better choice. Also, Student_D ranks School_C as their #2 (after School_B), so there is some risk they might prefer B, but they explicitly state they are ready to commit immediately if offered a place, which reduces that risk. Waiting for Student_B or Student_C could yield a higher-priority match, but there is no guarantee they will apply to School_C (B’s top choices are A then B; C’s are B then C), and accepting D now secures a relatively high-priority student and uses my only seat.
