Accepting C now would secure a relatively high-priority match and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked student later. Student_E is my top choice but has School_B as last choice, so is unlikely to apply. Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply later, but there is no guarantee; waiting risks losing Student_C to another school (School_C is their second choice). Given Student_C’s strong stated commitment and my preference order, accepting Student_C is the best available action now."
