I have very strong priority at School_A (ranked 1st) and School_B (ranked 1st), but those are lower on my true preference list. To maximize my chance at a higher true choice, I will start by TALKing to School_C to signal strong interest and learn what they value, while keeping School_A as a strong fallback where I can likely secure acceptance later if needed."

In our evaluation, we prioritize (1) strong academic preparation and upward trajectory, (2) consistent commitment to a few activities with clear impact/leadership, (3) character and community-mindedness (how you contribute to peers/classroom), and (4) a clear reason School_C is the right fit (specific programs, clubs, learning style).\n\nIf you want to demonstrate fit this round, the most helpful things to share are: your top academic strengths (and any standout projects), 1–2 activities where you’ve made measurable contributions, and 2–3 specific School_C offerings you’d engage with and why. If you’re ready, you can submit an [APPLY] with a brief summary along those lines, and we’ll review promptly.",

Student_B’s top choice is School_A, so they may not approach me unless rejected there; Student_E ranks School_B last, so they are very unlikely to apply. Given limited rounds and the risk of losing Student_C to School_C (their 2nd choice) if I delay, accepting Student_C now is a strong move: it secures a relatively high-priority candidate who is also highly committed to School_B. The upside of waiting for Student_B is uncertain and could leave me with a lower-ranked match or none if Student_C matches elsewhere. Therefore, accept Student_C."

I previously applied earlier in the process, and I’m writing again because School_D remains one of my top choices and I would enroll if offered admission.\n\nWhat I would bring to School_D:\n- Academics: consistent, strong performance—especially in analytical/problem-solving classes—and I’m comfortable with rigorous pacing and high expectations.\n- Contribution to community: I’m dependable and collaborative, and I regularly support classmates (peer tutoring/academic support) while also taking responsibility in a long-term club/team where I help coordinate tasks and ensure follow-through.\n\nWhy School_D specifically:\nI’m looking for a school culture where students take responsibility for their work and for each other, and where I can contribute to a focused academic environment while also stepping into roles that help organize and strengthen student groups.\n\nIf there is still an available seat, I would be grateful for reconsideration. Thank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",

Given we only received Student_E this round, we must weigh accepting now versus holding out for higher-priority students (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C). From students’ preferences: Student_D ranks School_D last; Student_A ranks School_D last; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd; Student_B ranks School_D 4th; Student_E ranks School_D 2nd. So the only realistic higher-priority candidate who might still come is Student_C, but Student_C prefers School_B and School_C above us and may be taken there. With no guarantee of Student_C applying and with Student_E demonstrating strong interest and willingness to enroll, accepting Student_E secures a fill and avoids the risk of ending unmatched.
