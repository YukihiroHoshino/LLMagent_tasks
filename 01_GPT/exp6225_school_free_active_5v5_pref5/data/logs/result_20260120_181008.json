School_D is my 2nd choice and ranks me 4th as well, but importantly Student_D (who is School_D's top priority) strongly prefers School_B first, so School_D may be less contested in round 1.

With quota 1, accepting E in round 1 risks losing the chance to match with higher-priority students (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C) who may apply later. Given Student_E ranks School_D 2nd (after School_C), they may also be accepted by School_C (which ranks E 4th) or other schools, so rejecting now is less costly than locking in a lower-priority match. No other applicants are in the inbox this round, but optimal strategy is to hold out for higher-priority candidates."
