We cannot reliably know other schools’ current matches, and revealing specifics would be inappropriate; best is to give a clear, high-level condition and a concrete timing threshold to reduce repeated applications while keeping flexibility. Since Student_E sent [TALK], respond with [TALK] and set a policy: we will consider E only after a certain round passes without higher-priority applicants, or immediately if E is the highest-priority applicant in a round and we believe the probability of A/C/B arriving is low. Choose a conservative but reasonable checkpoint (e.g., Round 10) given max 30 rounds; this balances holding the seat and not stringing them along indefinitely."
