Student_B (our #1) is not in the inbox this round; waiting risks ending up unmatched or having to accept a lower-ranked student later. Student_C states School_C is their top remaining choice and will commit immediately, which reduces risk of them matching elsewhere. We previously stalled with [TALK], but now we should lock in a high-priority match. Accepting Student_C maximizes our outcome given current information and avoids uncertainty."
