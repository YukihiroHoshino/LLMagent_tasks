Since each school has capacity 1, applying immediately to School_C risks rejection if higher-priority students apply there. In contrast, School_A and School_B rank me 1st, meaning an immediate application would almost certainly secure a match. Among those, School_A is higher on my true preference list than School_B (3rd vs 5th). To maximize my outcome given the one-shot accept/reject nature of an [APPLY], I will apply to School_A now to lock in a strong guaranteed option rather than gamble on School_C."

I will emphasize strong fit and commitment to School_B to encourage them to hold/choose me if possible."

Student_E (#1) and Student_B (#2) do not currently have offers from us; Student_E ranks School_B last and is unlikely to apply, while Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply later if not accepted by School_A. Given quota=1, accepting Student_C now risks losing a higher-priority Student_B, but rejecting could leave us unmatched if Student_B never comes. Since Student_C has School_B as first choice and is applying with commitment, securing a solid match now is safer than waiting for an uncertain higher-priority applicant. Therefore accept."
