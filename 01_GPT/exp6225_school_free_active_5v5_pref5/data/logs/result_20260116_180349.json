However, Student_C ranks School_D 3rd (after B, C) and may leave if later accepted by B or C; Student_E ranks School_D 2nd (after C) and claims C is unavailable, so E may be more likely to commit. Still, the objective is to match as high as possible on the true priority list, not maximize commitment probability. Also, higher-ranked Student_D or Student_A have not applied to School_D and likely prefer other schools; waiting risks ending unmatched if they never apply.

We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so accepting E now would fill our only seat and foreclose the possibility of matching with higher-priority students (A/C/B) if they later apply. Given the market: Student_A ranks School_E 4th; Student_C ranks School_E 4th; Student_B ranks School_E 5th. While not top choices, they may come to School_E after rejections elsewhere, and School_E is relatively attractive to A/C compared to B. Since we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside the list (not an issue here) but still aim to maximize match quality, we should continue holding for higher-priority candidates. History shows we already communicated this policy consistently; no new information suggests higher-priority candidates are off the market. Therefore, reject again to preserve optionality."
