Given students’ preferences: Student_D ranks School_D last; Student_A ranks School_D last; Student_E ranks School_D 2nd and may apply later; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and is already applying now. If I accept Student_C now, I forgo any chance at Student_D/Student_A (unlikely anyway) and also block potentially higher Student_E (ranked 4th, actually lower than C? wait: School_D ranks C above E). Since Student_C outranks Student_E in my priority, accepting C is aligned with my objective while ensuring the seat is filled with a relatively high-priority student.

Only Student_D applied this round, but accepting D now would forfeit any chance to match with higher-priority students (E/B/C) if they later engage; there is no holding cost except the risk of ending unmatched. Given rounds remaining (23/30) and that E/B/C all rank School_B relatively highly (E ranks B last; B ranks B second; C ranks B first), at least B or C could still plausibly apply. History indicates we have consistently held the seat for higher-priority candidates and have no new confirmation they are unavailable. Therefore, continue to reject D to preserve option value for higher-priority candidates."
