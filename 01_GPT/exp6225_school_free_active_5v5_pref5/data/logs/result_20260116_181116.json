Student_B is my #2 choice, while Student_A is my #5 (lowest acceptable). Although Student_E is my top choice, Student_E’s preferences place School_B last, so it is very unlikely they will apply. Holding the seat risks losing Student_B to School_A (Student_B’s #1), since School_A ranks Student_B ahead of Student_C and could accept them if they apply.
