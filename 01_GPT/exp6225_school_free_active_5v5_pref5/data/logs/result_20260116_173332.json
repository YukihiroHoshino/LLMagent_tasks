Higher-priority students for School_D are Student_D, Student_A, and Student_C. From student preferences: Student_D ranks School_D last; Student_A ranks School_D last; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd (after B and C) and may come later if rejected by B/C. Student_E ranks School_D 2nd (after School_C) and is actively applying now, suggesting a relatively high chance of securing a match if accepted. Given the round is early (2/30), there is some option value in waiting for Student_C, but no guarantee they will apply to School_D soon. Accepting Student_E now fills the only seat and prevents matching with a higher-priority candidate later; however, the top two candidates are very unlikely to apply, and Student_C may be captured by School_B or School_C. With only one concrete application in hand and Student_E being a strong, committed applicant who prefers School_D highly, accepting is a reasonable strategy to avoid ending unmatched."
