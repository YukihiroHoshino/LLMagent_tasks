Given we have full info: Student_E ranks School_A 3rd (after C,D), Student_D ranks School_A 3rd (after B,C), Student_A ranks School_A 3rd (after B,C). These higher-priority students are likely to apply first to their top choices (B/C/D) and may not reach School_A if accepted elsewhere, but we cannot be sure in round 1. Since we can only send one message per round and must decide now, the optimal strategy to maximize chance of matching with top priority is to reject lower-ranked Student_B now and keep capacity for E/D/A if they come later."

Student_B (2nd on our list) currently prefers School_A first, so may not approach us this round. Given we must respond now to Student_C’s APPLY with accept/reject, accepting secures a relatively high-priority match (3rd).
