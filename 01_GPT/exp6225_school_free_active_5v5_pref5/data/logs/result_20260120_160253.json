Applying now to School_C gives me a chance to secure a high-ranked option before seats fill, rather than spending a round on talk and losing time."

Given the market preferences, Student_B ranks School_C 3rd (after A, B), Student_C ranks School_C 2nd, Student_D ranks School_C 2nd, and Student_E ranks School_C 1st—so there is a meaningful chance higher-priority candidates will apply in later rounds. Therefore, reject Student_A to preserve capacity for higher-priority matches."

However, Student_D (ranked 4th) is only talking, not applying, and higher-priority students Student_E and Student_B have not contacted me yet. Given the market: Student_E ranks School_B last, so is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second behind School_A and may or may not apply depending on outcomes at School_A. Student_C ranks School_B first and is applying now, making this a strong, reliable match. With limited rounds and the risk of ending unmatched if I wait, accepting Student_C secures a high-priority (top-3) student immediately. Therefore, accept Student_C."

That said, if anything changes, it would be helpful for you to highlight the areas above—especially concrete examples of impact and why School_B specifically is the best fit for you.\n\nIf you’d like, share 2–3 bullet points on your academic interests and one activity where you’ve had the most impact, and I can suggest what to emphasize.\n\n[TALK]",
