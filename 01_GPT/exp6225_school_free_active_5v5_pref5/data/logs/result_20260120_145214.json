Continued [APPLY] attempts have been rejected because School_D is holding the seat for higher-priority students. Since another immediate re-application is unlikely to change the decision without new information, I will send a concise [TALK] message to (1) confirm the seat is still unfilled this round and (2) ask what concrete trigger would make them willing to stop holding and fill the seat, while reaffirming I can accept instantly if they decide to fill it with the best available applicant."

While the seat remains open, we must continue to follow our admissions priority order each round, and we may need to keep the seat available in case a higher-priority candidate applies.\n\nIf you choose to submit an [APPLY] in a future round, we will review it in the context of who applies in that same round and our priority order at that time.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_D Admissions",

Student_E is persistently interested and would accept immediately, but accepting now could block a higher-priority student if they later apply. We have no reliable information about whether higher-priority students are still unmatched or likely to apply; therefore, to maximize the chance of matching with a higher-priority student, we should continue to hold the seat. Since Student_E sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK], confirm seat status, and explain we cannot commit to a specific round/deadline for switching strategy, while inviting them to keep applying if they wish."
