However, I must consider whether holding out could yield Student_E or Student_B, who I prefer over C. Student_E’s preferences put School_B last, so E is very unlikely to apply. Student_B’s preferences rank School_B second, but Student_B ranks School_A first and School_A also ranks Student_B relatively low (4th), so B might later come to School_B if not accepted by A. Still, there is no guarantee B will apply soon, and accepting C now secures a high-priority match (3rd) with a committed applicant. Given E is essentially unattainable and waiting risks ending with a lower-priority student or no match, accept Student_C now."
