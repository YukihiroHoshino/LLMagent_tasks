Since any ACCEPT creates a binding match and removes me from further negotiations, I should accept the highest-ranked applicant currently available unless I have strong reason to wait for Student_E. Student_E ranks School_B last, so it is unlikely they will apply to me, making waiting risky. Therefore, accepting Student_B (my #2) is optimal versus holding out. Rejecting B to try for C/D/A would worsen my outcome, and accepting now secures a high-priority match."

There is no incentive to delay because no higher-priority student than Student_A exists for School_E, and accepting now prevents losing the seat to a lower-priority applicant later."
