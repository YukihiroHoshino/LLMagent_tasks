Given other students’ preferences: Student_B ranks School_C 3rd (likely to apply to School_A then School_B first), Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (likely to apply to School_B first), Student_D ranks School_C 2nd (likely to apply to School_B first), Student_A ranks School_C 2nd (also likely to apply to School_B first). This suggests there is a reasonable chance higher-priority students (especially Student_C or Student_D) may come to School_C in later rounds if rejected elsewhere.
