Higher-priority students (E, D, A) currently prefer other schools ahead of School_A (E: C/D ahead; D: B/C ahead; A: B/C ahead), so they may not apply to School_A early, but could later if rejected elsewhere. With only one round so far and no other applicants in inbox, it is strategically better to reject now to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates who might come later; accepting B would prevent matching with E/D/A if they approach later. Risk: ending unmatched if none of E/D/A apply, but given market size and 30 rounds, waiting is reasonable."

Although Student_B (my top choice) has not applied yet and ranks School_C as 3rd, I cannot proactively solicit and there is no guarantee B will come; rejecting C now risks ending with a lower-priority match later or an unfilled seat. Student_C also indicates strong interest (School_C among top choices; in their preference list School_C is 2nd), making acceptance likely to hold.
