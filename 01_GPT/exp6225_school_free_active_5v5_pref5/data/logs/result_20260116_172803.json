In this round, I have applications from Student_C and Student_A; accepting Student_C would secure a relatively high-priority match and fill my only seat immediately. However, Student_E is my top priority and lists School_B last, so is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply if not accepted by School_A, so there is some chance to do better by waiting. Given the uncertainty of Student_B applying and the risk of losing Student_C to another school (Student_C also ranks School_C second, and School_C ranks Student_C 2nd), it is safer to lock in Student_C now rather than gamble for Student_B. Therefore, accept Student_C."

To maximize my final outcome, I should target the highest school where I have a strong acceptance chance: School_A ranks me 2nd (behind E), and several students rank School_A #1 or #3, but only Student_E outranks me there.
