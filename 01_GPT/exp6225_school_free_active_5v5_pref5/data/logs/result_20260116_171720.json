From preferences: Student_D and Student_A place School_D last, making it very unlikely they will apply unless rejected everywhere else late in the process. Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and may apply if rejected by School_B and School_C. Student_E ranks School_D 2nd and is actively applying now, indicating high likelihood of commitment. Given my quota is 1 and I currently have no match, waiting could risk ending unmatched; however, accepting now could forgo a potential later application from Student_C. Considering we are only at round 4 and Student_C may still have chances at B/C (which they prefer), the probability they come to D soon is uncertain. With Student_E repeatedly applying and being within my acceptable list, the safer strategy to secure a match is to accept Student_E now rather than gamble on a higher-ranked student who may never apply."
