In contrast, School_A ranks me 1st, and School_A is my 3rd choice—still very good and much more secure. To maximize my final outcome (avoid ending up with a low-ranked option), I will apply to School_A immediately where I have top priority and a strong chance of acceptance."

School_C ranks me 3rd and is my 2nd choice, and I’m ahead of Student_E and Student_A there. Since Student_B has School_C as 3rd and Student_C has School_C as 2nd, competition exists, so I should apply immediately to School_C to secure a high-ranked match rather than risk losing both B and C.

However, School_B’s priority list ranks me last, while several other students (especially Student_E and Student_B) are ranked above me and are also likely to apply there.
