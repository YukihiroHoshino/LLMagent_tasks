Still, given we have 30 rounds and no cost to waiting besides risking losing Student_E, the optimal move to maximize my priority match is to reject now and keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates who may come later. Student_E has other options (School_D next) and may re-approach if unmatched, but I cannot hold a spot without an accept mechanism. Therefore, reject to preserve capacity for higher-ranked students."
