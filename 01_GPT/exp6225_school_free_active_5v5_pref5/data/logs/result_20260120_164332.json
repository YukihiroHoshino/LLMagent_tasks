Accepting D now would fill my only seat and prevent matching with B or C later. Since the mechanism is binding upon ACCEPT, the optimal strategic move is to reject D now to keep capacity for higher-priority candidates, despite the risk of ending unmatched. Given multiple schools and that B/C are likely to apply to B or A first, there is uncertainty, but maximizing priority suggests holding the seat. Therefore, REJECT Student_D with an encouraging note to re-engage if still interested in later rounds (though formal re-apply may not be possible, the dialogue can continue)."

Among remaining unmatched schools (A, D, E), School_E is higher on my true preference list than School_A, so I should prioritize applying there now. I also have relatively strong priority at School_E (2nd), which gives a good chance of acceptance if they are still open. Therefore I will submit a clear commitment-style application to School_E."

With quota 1 and no current match, accepting Student_C secures a very high-priority match immediately. Waiting for Student_A is risky because Student_A ranks School_E 4th and is likely to match earlier with School_B/School_C/School_A, where they are also competitive. Since Student_C is an excellent outcome and is ready to commit, the optimal move is to accept."
