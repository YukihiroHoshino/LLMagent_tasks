If I accept Student_C now, I forgo the chance to take Student_B later. Given the mechanism, I can only respond accept/reject to an apply; I cannot hold. To maximize expected outcome, I should reject C now to keep the seat available for potentially higher-ranked Student_B. Risk: I may end up with Student_D or A or unfilled, but Student_C will likely match elsewhere (C lists B first then C).
