Student_A and Student_D also rank School_B first, and Student_B ranks it second, while Student_E ranks it last. If Student_B applies to School_A (their 1st) and Student_E applies to School_C (their 1st), my main competition at School_B is Student_A and Student_D, both of whom are ranked below me at School_B.

Student_C is the best applicant currently in the inbox, but higher-priority students (E and B) may still apply later. However, Student_E ranks School_B last and is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply to School_A first, making it uncertain we can secure them. Given Student_C states School_B is first choice and will accept immediately, accepting now secures a relatively high-priority match (3rd) and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority student or remaining unmatched if higher-priority students do not apply. Therefore, accept Student_C."

Student_E’s preferences place School_D as 2nd (after School_C), so they may still prefer/try for School_C if available, but they are applying now and indicate willingness to commit. Given the mechanism: if we reject, we risk ending unmatched if higher-priority students never apply to us; if we accept, we secure a decent (listed) candidate. Since no other applicants are in our inbox this round and we cannot hold/conditionally accept, accepting Student_E maximizes expected outcome under uncertainty relative to leaving the seat empty."
