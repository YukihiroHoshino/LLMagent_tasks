School_A is my 3rd choice and crucially ranks me 1st, so an early application should secure an immediate match at a relatively high-preference school.

Since accepting D now would lock my only seat and prevent matching with higher-priority C (or potentially E/B in later rounds), I should reject D to preserve the option to accept a higher-priority applicant.
