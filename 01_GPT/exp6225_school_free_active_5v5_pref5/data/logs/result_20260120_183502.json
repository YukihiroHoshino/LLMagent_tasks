Student_E prefers School_C then School_D, so E is unlikely to apply to School_A in round 1.

However, Student_B and Student_C (my top two) both rank School_C as their 3rd and 2nd choice respectively, and may apply later if rejected elsewhere; accepting E now would fill my only seat and eliminate the chance to match with B or C. Still, Student_E ranks School_C as #1 and is offering a firm commit, while B and C are likely to secure School_A/School_B ahead of me given their preferences and other schools' priorities, so the probability of landing B or C may be low. Given the credible commitment from a mid-high priority candidate (E) and the risk of ending up with an even lower option or unfilled, I will accept Student_E now."
