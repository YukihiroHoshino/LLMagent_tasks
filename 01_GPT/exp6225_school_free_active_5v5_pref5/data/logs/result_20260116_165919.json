Since quota is 1, we should not accept Student_A over Student_C. However, we must also consider that Student_E (#1) and Student_B (#2) may apply in later rounds; accepting Student_C now could block a higher-priority match. Looking at preferences: Student_E ranks School_B last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_B second after School_A and may end up applying if not accepted by School_A. Still, there is no guarantee Student_B will apply to us, and delaying risks losing Student_C (who has School_B as first choice) to School_C next round. Given Student_C’s strong interest and higher rank than the other current applicant, the best move is to accept Student_C now to secure a good match rather than gamble on a potential later application from Student_B."
