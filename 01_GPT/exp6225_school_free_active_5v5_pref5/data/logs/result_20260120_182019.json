If you can offer me the remaining seat in this round, I will accept immediately and confirm enrollment right away, withdrawing from all other options the same round. Since we are now in round 16 and your seat is still unfilled, if your higher-priority candidates have been resolved or are no longer available, I would be grateful if you could finalize your class with me now. Thank you for your continued consideration.",

I have been repeatedly rejected because the school is holding the seat for higher-priority students; at this late stage (round 16), the best strategy is to continue applying with a clear, unconditional commitment to accept immediately and withdraw from all other options, giving School_B maximum certainty to finalize if they are able to move down their priority list."

We are able to finalize our class now, and we are pleased to offer you admission. Please confirm your acceptance and complete the enrollment steps as instructed; once confirmed, we will consider your seat secured at School_B. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "As School_B, my true priority is E > B > C > D > A. Student_D is 4th on my list and has repeatedly applied with a commitment to enroll. However, I still have quota 1 and no match yet. Higher-priority students (E, B, C) all have preference lists where School_B is not their top choice except C (School_B is #1) and E (School_B is last). Student_C already applied earlier and was rejected; they may reapply, but there is no message from them this round. Student_B prefers School_A first and may never come; Student_E ranks me last and is unlikely to apply. Given we are at round 16 with no inbound from higher-priority candidates and continued risk of ending unmatched, accepting Student_D now secures a match with a listed candidate (acceptable) and avoids leaving the seat empty. This sacrifices the possibility of later matching with Student_C or Student_B, but their likelihood of engaging now appears low; Student_C was turned away and may move on. Therefore accept Student_D."
