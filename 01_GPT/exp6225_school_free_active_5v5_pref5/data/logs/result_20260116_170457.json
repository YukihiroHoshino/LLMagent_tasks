However, Student_E (my top choice) and Student_B (my second choice) have not yet applied this round; both have School_B as a non-first choice but still relatively high (E ranks B last; B ranks B second), so there is some chance they may apply later. The protocol forces an accept/reject on an [APPLY] message (no holding). Given the objective to match as high as possible on my priority list, rejecting C now preserves the possibility of matching with E or B later; if they never apply, I risk ending unmatched or matching with a lower-priority student later. Since C is still my 3rd choice and a strong option, but the upside of waiting for E/B is significant with only one seat, I will reject C in round 1 to keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates."
