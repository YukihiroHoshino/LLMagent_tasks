That means my acceptance probability at School_B is low, but applying now is still optimal because (1) it’s my true first choice and (2) if higher-priority students go elsewhere, I could still be accepted.

Student_E ranks School_D as their 2nd choice (after School_C), so they may still prefer School_C and could leave if not firmly committed; however they state they can commit immediately. I should consider whether I can realistically secure a higher-priority student later. Student_D and Student_A both rank School_D last, making them unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and could apply later, but may be taken by School_B or School_C first. Given uncertainty and that Student_E is still on my acceptable list, accepting now secures a decent match rather than risking ending unfilled."
