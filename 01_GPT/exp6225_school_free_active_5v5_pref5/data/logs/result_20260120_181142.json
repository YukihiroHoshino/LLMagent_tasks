Since each school has capacity 1 and those higher-priority students are likely to apply to School_B, an immediate [APPLY] risks a quick rejection. My second choice, School_C, ranks me 3rd, and the two ahead of me (Students B and C) may be pulled toward their higher choices (A/B), so School_C is a more realistic path to a high-ranked outcome. I will [APPLY] to School_C now with a strong commitment message to improve my chances before spots fill."

Accepting D now would fill my seat but could block the possibility of matching with higher-priority Student_B or Student_C later. Student_B ranks School_C third (after A, B) and Student_C ranks School_C second (after B), so there is a realistic chance either may approach School_C in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Given the market, holding the seat is valuable. Since I must respond to Student_D's APPLY with accept/reject (cannot TALK), I should reject now to preserve the chance for a higher-priority match."

In this round, Student_D (ranked higher) also applied, but was already rejected historically and again appears; regardless, accepting Student_A would fill the only seat with our lowest-priority option and block any chance to match with higher-priority students (Student_B or Student_C) who may apply later (both list School_C as a high choice). Since we prefer leaving unfilled over taking outside the list, but Student_A is on the list (albeit last), the key decision is whether to hold the seat for higher-ranked candidates. Given round 1 and strong likelihood that Student_B/Student_C will seek School_C (they rank it 3rd/2nd respectively), rejecting Student_A now preserves flexibility to secure a higher-priority match."

In this round I have applications from B and C; accepting B secures a higher-priority student immediately. Although Student_E is my top choice, Student_E’s preferences place School_B last, so it is very unlikely they will apply. Student_B prefers School_A first, so there is some risk they would not apply to me later if rejected now; since they are applying now, accepting locks in a strong outcome.
