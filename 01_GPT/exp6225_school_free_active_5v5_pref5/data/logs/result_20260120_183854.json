Among these, Student_C is the highest on my priority list, so accepting C now secures a better outcome than accepting D or A. Could I do better by waiting for Student_E or Student_B? Student_E ranks School_B last, so is unlikely to apply here early (or at all). Student_B ranks School_B second but will likely apply to School_A first; given School_A’s priorities, B is low there, so B might come to School_B later, but that is uncertain. Since I can only accept/reject (no holding) and already have a high-priority applicant (C), the safe strategy is to accept Student_C now rather than risk ending up with a lower-priority match or unfilled seat."
