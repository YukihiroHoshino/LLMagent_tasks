School_D is my #2 and ranks me 4th, but importantly Student_D (who is #1 at School_D) is likely to apply to School_B first (their #1), and Student_A (ranked #2 at School_D) also likely applies to School_B first. That makes School_D a more realistic early match while still very high on my true list. I will apply to School_D now to lock in a strong option before competition shifts."
