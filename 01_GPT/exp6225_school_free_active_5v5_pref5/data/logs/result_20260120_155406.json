No higher-priority candidates (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C) have applied yet; however, it is still within the stated rounds 12–15 window where they may apply, and accepting E now would forfeit the chance to match with any of those higher-priority students if they apply later. Student_E also has School_D as 2nd choice and may continue to apply, so rejecting now preserves flexibility without necessarily losing E later. Given our objective to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should continue holding the seat this round and reject."

Given the market, Student_D/A likely prefer other schools (both rank School_D last), but they could still apply later if rejected elsewhere; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and could plausibly come if B/C fill.
