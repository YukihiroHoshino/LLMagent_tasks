School_E is my next-best remaining option (ranked 4th) and their priority list ranks me 4th as well, giving a plausible chance if Student_A/Student_C/Student_B are matched elsewhere. To maximize the probability of securing a match with the best available school, I will apply to School_E and clearly signal commitment."

Even so, given we are early (round 4/30) and have already rejected D (lowest priority), it is strategically better to hold the seat for higher-priority candidates rather than lock in with a lower-ranked student now."
