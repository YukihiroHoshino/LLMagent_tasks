However, Student_E (my top choice) and Student_B (second) may apply later: Student_E lists School_B last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere; Student_B lists School_B second and may apply if not accepted by School_A. If I accept Student_C now, I lose the chance to take Student_B later. But there is no option to defer with [TALK] because Student_C sent [APPLY] and I must [ACCEPT]/[REJECT]. Given Student_C states School_B is first choice and will commit, and uncertainty that Student_B will become available, accept Student_C to secure a high-ranked match rather than risk ending with lower-ranked Student_A or vacancy."
