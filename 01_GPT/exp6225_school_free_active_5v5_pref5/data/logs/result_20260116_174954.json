Since agreements are immediate and binding, accepting B now secures my #2 choice but risks missing #1 (E). Check Student_E preferences: E ranks School_B last, so E is very unlikely to apply to me in later rounds unless rejected everywhere else. Meanwhile, Student_B ranks School_B second (after School_A). If I reject B now, B may match with School_A quickly (School_A ranks B 4th but could still accept depending on competition), leaving me to choose among C/D/A later, which are lower on my list than B. Given E’s low likelihood to come to me and the availability of my high-ranked candidate B now, the best strategy to maximize my outcome is to accept Student_B."
