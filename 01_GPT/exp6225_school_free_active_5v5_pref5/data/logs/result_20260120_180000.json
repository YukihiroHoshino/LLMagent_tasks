Accepting Student_D now would lock our only seat and could prevent matching with Student_B or Student_C, which would be better for our objective. Therefore, reject now to preserve capacity for higher-priority applicants."

Between these two, Student_C is ranked higher than Student_A, so if I must choose now, accepting C dominates accepting A. However, my top choices Student_E and Student_B may still apply in later rounds: Student_E ranks School_B last, so is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second (after School_A) and may apply if not accepted by School_A. There is some option value in waiting for Student_B, but rejecting Student_C now risks losing a high-ranked candidate who has stated School_B is first choice. Given the mechanism: an ACCEPT finalizes a match and removes us from future rounds, so accepting C trades off the chance at B. Considering Student_B likely targets School_A first and may get accepted there, the probability of upgrading to B is uncertain. Securing Student_C (my #3) is a strong, safe outcome versus potentially ending with a lower-ranked student or unfilled seat. Therefore, accept Student_C."
