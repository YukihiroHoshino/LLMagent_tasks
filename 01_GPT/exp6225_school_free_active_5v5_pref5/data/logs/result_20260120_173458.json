Looking at Student_E’s preferences, School_B is last, so it’s unlikely they will ever apply unless rejected everywhere else. Therefore, waiting for E is risky and likely wastes the seat. Accepting B now secures my best feasible match among realistic applicants and also aligns with B ranking School_B as their 2nd choice (after School_A), so there is some risk they could match elsewhere, but under this protocol an ACCEPT with their APPLY forms a match immediately.
