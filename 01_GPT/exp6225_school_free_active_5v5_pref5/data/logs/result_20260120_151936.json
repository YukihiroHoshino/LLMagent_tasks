Student_C is ranked above Student_D, and Student_E/Student_B (my top two) have not contacted me yet; Student_B’s first choice is School_A, and Student_E’s last choice is School_B, so they are unlikely to apply soon, but still possible later if rejected elsewhere.

Student_E’s last choice is School_B, so unlikely to apply. Student_B prefers School_A first and may match elsewhere; still, there is some chance B later considers School_B if rejected by A, but uncertain.
