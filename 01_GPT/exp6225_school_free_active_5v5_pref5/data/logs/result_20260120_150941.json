Since you mentioned the late-stage benchmark (around round 25+), I wanted to ask one quick planning question: would you prefer that I check in again at a specific round (e.g., round 15 or 20), or should I simply wait until closer to round 25 unless you invite me to re-apply?\n\nI don’t want to spam your inbox, but I also want to stay active and responsive if the situation changes.\n\nSincerely,\nStudent_E",
              "thought": "Only School_D is currently unmatched and it is my #2 true preference (after School_C, which already rejected due to seat filled). School_D has indicated rejections were due to holding the seat for higher-priority applicants and that late-stage (around round 25+) they may fill with the best available applicant. In round 11, repeatedly re-applying is unlikely to change the outcome, so I should keep the relationship warm, signal continued strong interest and immediate readiness, and ask for any concrete check-in cadence or trigger that would make them comfortable extending an offer earlier if no higher-priority candidates appear."
