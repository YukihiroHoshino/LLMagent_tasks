Given the market info, higher-priority students (especially Student_C, who ranks us 3rd, and Student_A/Student_D who rank us last) could still become available if they are rejected by their top choices (School_B/School_C) in later rounds. Accepting Student_E now would lock our only seat and prevent a higher-priority match. Since we prefer waiting (and can leave seat unfilled rather than accept lower), we should reject again while being transparent about likely timing (1–2 rounds) and invite them to keep applying."

Given repeated rejections, we have been holding the seat for higher-priority candidates (Student_D/Student_A/Student_C) who may become available if they fail to secure B/C/A. With rounds remaining (15/30) and no cost to waiting other than the risk of ending unmatched, it is still optimal to reject E now to preserve the chance of matching with a higher-priority student.

We have been holding the seat across many rounds explicitly to wait for higher-priority candidates to apply; none have contacted us this round, but the process is only at round 16/30, so there is still meaningful chance that a higher-priority student (especially Student_C, who ranks us 3rd) could eventually apply if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose the possibility of matching with Student_D/A/C later.

By round 17, probability of receiving an application from D/A/C is low; continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched, which is worse than taking Student_E (who is on our list).
