However, I must consider whether holding out could secure Student_E or Student_B later. Student_E ranks School_B last, so is very unlikely to apply here. Student_B ranks School_B second but likely applies to School_A first; School_A’s top priorities are E then D, so Student_B may be rejected by School_A and could come to School_B later. Yet there is no mechanism for tentative holds—an [ACCEPT] finalizes the match and ends my participation. The objective is to match as high as possible within my quota; given current actionable offers, Student_C is the best available and is also a strong, reliable match (they state School_B is first choice). The risk of waiting for Student_B is nontrivial and could leave me unmatched; additionally, Student_C may be taken by School_C if I reject. Therefore I accept Student_C now."

However, School_D has repeatedly rejected my [APPLY] due to holding the seat for higher-priority students until the end of Round 24, and they clarified that even [TALK] outreach from a higher-priority student would extend that hold. Therefore, applying again in Round 22 is very likely to be an automatic rejection and could be counterproductive. The best move is to maintain presence with a brief [TALK] that (1) confirms I remain ready to apply immediately at the Round 25 start if the Round 24 checkpoint passes, and (2) asks whether any higher-priority outreach has occurred so far (yes/no), which they may be willing to answer in aggregate without naming individuals."
