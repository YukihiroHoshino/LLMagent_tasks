That said, we are still holding our remaining seat primarily for the possibility that one of those higher-priority candidates may apply later in the process.\n\nBecause those candidates can still appear in a future round, we can’t provide a firm “if X doesn’t happen by next round, then we will offer” signal or a specific round-based trigger. If our situation changes such that we determine those higher-priority candidates are no longer realistically in play for School_B, we will reassess promptly.\n\nIn the meantime, the prudent approach is for you to continue pursuing your other options while keeping School_B as a possibility. You’re welcome to check back again in a later round.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_B Admissions",
              "thought": "Student_D is 4th on School_B’s true priority list (E, B, C, D, A). School_B still has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Student_D is engaging repeatedly and is willing to commit immediately, but accepting now would forgo the chance to match with higher-priority Student_E or Student_B (or Student_C, though previously rejected) if they apply later. Given the rules, only an [APPLY]+[ACCEPT] finalizes a match; with [TALK] we can keep flexibility. Student_D asks for a high-level signal; we can’t credibly commit to a specific round, but we can be transparent that we have not received recent engagement from higher-priority candidates and that we are still holding the seat for the possibility. Best move is to continue [TALK], encourage them to pursue other options, and invite them to check back, preserving the seat for higher-priority students."

Higher-priority candidates (Student_E and Student_B) have not engaged with School_B recently; Student_C previously applied and was rejected; Student_A also rejected. Accepting Student_D now would fill our sole quota but risks missing a later application from Student_E or Student_B, who are strictly preferred and could still appear in later rounds. Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list and we still have time (round 15/30) with no binding cost to waiting, the optimal strategy is to continue holding the seat and reject Student_D again despite their commitment signal."

In prior rounds I rejected A, C, and D to hold the seat for higher-priority Student_E or Student_B (and possibly Student_C). Given full market info: Student_E ranks School_B last, so they are very unlikely to ever apply. Student_B ranks School_B second but prefers School_A first; however School_A’s top priorities are E and D, and D strongly prefers School_B, so D likely competes well for School_A only if they apply there. Student_B could end up rejected by School_A and then apply to School_B, which would be better for me than D. But we are already at round 16 with no sign of Student_B engaging; continuing to hold risks ending unmatched through round 30. Since D is repeatedly applying and will commit immediately, accepting now secures a match with an acceptable candidate rather than risking an empty seat. Therefore accept Student_D."
