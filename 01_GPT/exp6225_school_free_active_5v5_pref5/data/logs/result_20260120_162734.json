              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are unmatched at the final round (30). Student_E is on our true priority list (4th), so acceptable. Although we have been pursuing higher-priority candidates (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C), none have finalized with us by Round 30, and there are no other applicants in the inbox this round. If we reject, we likely end unmatched, which is worse than filling with an acceptable candidate. Student_E has repeatedly committed to enroll immediately, reducing risk. Therefore accept to secure a match and maximize outcome given constraints and end-of-cycle timing."
