Between them, Student_C ranks higher than Student_A, so if I must choose among current applicants, accepting C is better. However, Student_E (my top choice) and Student_B (second) have not applied yet; Student_E’s top choice is School_C and Student_B’s top choice is School_A, so they may not come to me in later rounds, but it is possible if rejected elsewhere. Still, the mechanism is immediate: if I accept Student_C now, I fill my only seat and cannot take E/B later. Given the risk that E/B never apply to me (likely), and C is my #3 and is explicitly committed with School_B as first choice, accepting C now is a strong outcome versus holding out and potentially ending with a lower-priority student or no match. Therefore, accept Student_C."

School_C ranks me 1st, making acceptance very likely if I apply. However, since this is round 1, I should first try for my true top choice (School_A) with an application, because if I somehow get accepted I secure my best outcome; if rejected, I can pivot quickly next round to School_C where I have top priority.

Student_E is School_A's top priority and also ranks School_A 3rd, but still applied, indicating willingness to match now. Accepting Student_B (4th priority) would forgo the chance to secure Student_E immediately. Given the mechanism, an [ACCEPT] forms a binding match and removes us from further negotiation, so we should reserve the seat for the highest-priority applicant available.

School_A is my 3rd choice but I am School_A’s #1 priority, so an early [APPLY] should secure a match immediately and prevent ending up in a worse school.

Since each school has capacity 1, applying immediately to School_B is very likely to be rejected if those higher-priority students apply there. My next choice is School_C, where I am ranked 3rd (behind B and C). Student_B’s top choice is School_A, and Student_C’s top choice is School_B, so School_C is less likely to be targeted first by the two students ahead of me in School_C’s priority.
