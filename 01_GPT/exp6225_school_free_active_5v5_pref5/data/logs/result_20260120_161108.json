So realistically only Student_C is likely to apply to us before E, but C may still be pursuing B/C first. Given we are in round 7 of 30, the option value of waiting remains. Student_E is asking whether higher-priority candidates have contacted us; we should be truthful: none have contacted this round (inbox only E), and we are holding as a precaution. Continue TALK and encourage E to pursue other options; do not commit."

However, it is still plausible they may come later if rejected elsewhere. With quota 1, accepting E now would block the chance to match with a higher-priority student. Since Student_E is only [TALK] and not an [APPLY], we should continue to hold the seat and provide a clear, time-bound policy to reduce uncertainty while preserving optionality. Set a concrete cutoff (e.g., end of round 10) after which, if no higher-priority applications arrive, we will consider extending an offer to the highest-priority remaining interested applicant (which would likely be E if still available)."
