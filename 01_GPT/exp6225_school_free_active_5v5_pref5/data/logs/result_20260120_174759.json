Although Student_E and Student_B are ranked above C, neither has contacted me this round; moreover, Student_E ranks School_B last and Student_B ranks School_A first, so the likelihood they apply to me soon is low. With quota 1, accepting C now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority student or an unfilled seat later.
