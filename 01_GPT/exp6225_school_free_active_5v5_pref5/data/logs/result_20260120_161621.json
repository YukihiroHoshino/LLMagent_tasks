Student_B is the highest-ranked among current applicants, but Student_E (my top choice) has not applied and in their preferences School_B is last, so they are very unlikely to approach me unless rejected elsewhere. Given the rules, if I accept Student_B now, I secure my #2 choice and avoid the risk of ending unmatched or ending up with a lower-ranked student. Student_B also ranks School_B as their 2nd choice (after School_A), so there is some risk they could match with School_A if not accepted here; accepting now locks in a strong outcome for me.

Accepting Student_A immediately secures my best possible match and uses my only quota; there is no strategic reason to delay because no candidate can beat Student_A in my preferences, and Student_A has explicitly stated they will enroll immediately if admitted. Therefore I should accept Student_A and fill my seat."
