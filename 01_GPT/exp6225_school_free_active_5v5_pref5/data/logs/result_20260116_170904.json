Since School_D is the only remaining unmatched school and it remains a top choice for me, could you share whether your remaining seat is still open and what you are prioritizing at this point (e.g., specific priority order, commitment, or any other factors)? If there is a realistic path for me to be reconsidered this round, I’m ready to commit immediately. Thank you for your guidance.",
              "thought": "Only School_D remains unmatched and it is my #2 true preference. I have been rejected multiple times, likely due to priority competition, so a softer [TALK] approach may help me learn whether the seat is still realistically available for me or if there is any condition under which I could be reconsidered, before using another [APPLY]."

In terms of what we prioritize, we follow our established priority order first (rather than commitment statements alone), and we can only finalize an offer when we are confident we won’t be displacing a higher-priority applicant who is still in play. \n\nAt this point, if you would like to be formally considered again this round, please send an [APPLY]. I can’t promise an outcome in advance, but I will review immediately based on our priority and current availability.",
              "thought": "As School_D, my true priority is D > A > C > E > B. I have 1 seat and remain unmatched. Student_E is on my list but ranks 4th, so I have been rejecting while hoping higher-priority students might apply. However, by round 6, no other students have contacted me, and the prompt indicates School_D is the only remaining unmatched school, suggesting higher-priority students likely secured matches elsewhere and may not become available. Student_E is signaling strong commitment and is currently only asking to talk, not apply. Best move is to keep dialogue open, be transparent that the seat is open but decisions follow priority, and invite an [APPLY] while not promising acceptance; if no higher-priority candidate appears, I can reconsider accepting E to avoid leaving the seat empty."

              "thought": "As School_D, my true priority ranks Student_E 4th (below Student_D, Student_A, Student_C). I still have 1 seat and no current match. However, given the market information, Student_D and Student_A rank School_D last and are unlikely to apply; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd but is likely pursuing School_B/School_C first; Student_B ranks School_D 4th and also likely has better options. We are already in round 7 with only School_D noted as remaining unmatched in the history, indicating higher-priority students are probably matched elsewhere. Holding the seat longer risks ending unmatched; accepting Student_E now secures a match with an acceptable (listed) candidate. Therefore, accept."
