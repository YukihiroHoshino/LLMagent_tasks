However, Student_E is top priority for School_A and is likely to apply to School_A after being rejected/unsuccessful at higher choices (Student_E prefers School_C then School_D; both schools rank Student_E 4th, so Student_E may not secure those). Student_D and Student_A prefer School_B and School_C over School_A, and those schools rank them mid-lower, making their eventual application to School_A plausible but not guaranteed.
