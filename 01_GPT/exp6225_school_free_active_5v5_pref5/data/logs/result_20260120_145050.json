Among these, C is the highest on our priority list, so accepting C dominates accepting A or D. However, we must consider whether to hold out for higher-priority students E or B. Student_E does not rank us highly (puts School_B last), so is unlikely to apply here unless rejected elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_B second after School_A and may apply here if not accepted by School_A; but School_A’s top priorities are E then D then A then B, so B is not very likely to be accepted there if E/D/A apply. Still, B might come to us in a later round. Yet we are not allowed to “hold” offers; we must accept/reject now. Given we already have a solid applicant (C) who ranks us first, and the chance of getting B is uncertain, the safe strategy to maximize expected outcome within quota is to accept C now rather than risk ending unmatched or matched with lower-ranked D/A later. Therefore accept Student_C."

By contrast, School_A ranks me 1st overall, and School_A is my 3rd choice. Applying to School_A in round 1 gives me a very high chance to lock in a strong match immediately before competition intensifies, rather than risking rejection at School_C and losing the chance to secure School_A if it fills.
