Even though School_B has rejected me twice, their priority list ranks me above Student_A (who is last), so if higher-priority students (Student_E, Student_B, Student_C) are matched elsewhere or not applying, I could still be the best remaining option. Therefore I should apply again to School_B with a clear commitment and a concise update, while signaling I will accept immediately if offered."

In this round, only Student_A and Student_D applied to me; neither Student_E nor Student_B (my top two) are currently pursuing me, and Student_C previously applied but is not in this round’s inbox. With quota 1, I should accept the highest-ranked applicant available now unless I have strong reason to expect a higher-priority student will apply later. Student_B prefers School_A first, and Student_E ranks School_B last, making it unlikely they will apply to me. Student_D ranks School_B first and is committing, and D is ranked above A on my list. Therefore accepting Student_D maximizes my outcome given current information and avoids risking ending unmatched."
