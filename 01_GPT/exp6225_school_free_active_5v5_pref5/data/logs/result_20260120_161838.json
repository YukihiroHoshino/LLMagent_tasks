Between them, Student_C is ranked higher than Student_D, so if choosing among current applicants, C is preferable. However, I have quota 1 and should consider whether holding out could yield Student_E or Student_B, who are ranked above C. Student_E ranks School_B last, so is very unlikely to apply. Student_B ranks School_B second (after School_A), so B might apply later if not accepted by School_A, but that is uncertain and could take multiple rounds. Student_C ranks School_B first and is applying now with a commitment to enroll, offering a high-likelihood, high-priority match. Accepting C secures my best available option now and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked student or unfilled seat."
