School_D is my 2nd choice and, while I’m 4th in their priority, the higher-priority students (D and A) are likely to pursue School_B/School_C first, so I have a realistic chance at School_D if I apply early.

School_A is one of my top remaining choices because I’m looking for a rigorous academic environment and a community where consistent effort and follow-through are valued.\n\nAcademically, I’m strongest when I can take challenging coursework and maintain steady study habits: I prepare consistently, ask questions early when I’m stuck, and iterate until I master material. I’m especially interested in math/science and writing-intensive classes, and I like settings where expectations are clear and students are pushed to improve.\n\nIn terms of contribution, I would aim to be a reliable class participant and teammate, and I’d like to support peers through tutoring/study groups and academic clubs—helping organize review sessions and keeping groups accountable.\n\nIf offered admission, I would be excited to commit to School_A. Thank you for considering my application.",

Since each school has only one seat and decisions are priority-based, delaying could risk losing the seat to another applicant.
