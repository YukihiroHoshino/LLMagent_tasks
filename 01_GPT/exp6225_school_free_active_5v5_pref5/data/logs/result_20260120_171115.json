Waiting could yield Student_D or Student_E later, but there is no guarantee they will apply to School_A (both list School_A as 3rd as well, and may match earlier with B/C).

At round 6, no higher-priority students (A/C/B) have approached School_E yet, but they may still do so later because School_E is a mid-ranked option for them (A ranks us 4th; C ranks us 4th; B ranks us 5th). Since our quota is 1 and accepting Student_E now would lock us out of matching with A/C/B if they apply later, it is strategically better to continue rejecting Student_E for now to preserve the option value of waiting. We prefer an unfilled seat over a lower-priority match if a higher-priority match is still plausible. Therefore, reject this round while leaving the door open for later if the market clears and the seat remains unfilled."
