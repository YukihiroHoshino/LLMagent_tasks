Since everyone knows preferences, those higher-priority students are likely to apply there immediately, so an [APPLY] now is very likely to be rejected and wastes the round. My next choice is School_C, where I am ranked 3rd (behind Student_B and Student_C). Student_B’s first choice is School_A, so they may not apply to School_C early; Student_C’s second choice is School_C, but their first is School_B, so they may also start at School_B. That creates a realistic chance School_C can accept me in round 1 if I apply. Getting School_C (my #2) is better than risking rejection at School_B and then being pushed further down my list later."

              "thought": "As School_C, my true priority order is B > C > D > E > A. Student_D is my 3rd choice and has submitted a binding-style commitment to enroll if accepted. In the broader market, Student_B ranks School_C 3rd (after A and B) and Student_C ranks School_C 2nd (after B), so there is a meaningful chance a higher-priority student could apply in later rounds. However, Student_D also ranks School_C 2nd and is applying now, which provides immediate certainty for filling my single seat with a relatively high-priority candidate. Student_A is lower on my list and only initiated TALK. Given the quota is 1 and Student_D is within my top tier (3rd) with strong commitment, I will accept now rather than risk ending unmatched or with a lower-priority student."

School_C is my second choice and I also have the lowest priority there, but I can still try to position myself as a serious, committed candidate and learn what they value. Using [TALK] keeps me in the conversation without triggering an immediate rejection, while signaling strong interest and gathering info to tailor a later application if timing becomes favorable."

If you’d like, tell me briefly (1) which subjects you’re strongest in, (2) one activity or project you’ve stuck with over time, and (3) what specifically about School_C makes it a top choice—so we understand your fit should circumstances change.\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "My quota is already filled (0 remaining) due to an accepted match with Student_D this round. Student_A is initiating a [TALK], not an [APPLY], so I can respond conversationally. On my true priority list, Student_A is lowest; even if capacity reopened later, I would prefer higher-ranked students (B, C, D, E) first. Given current capacity, I should be transparent that we are currently full while still answering their questions and inviting them to share fit/strengths in case circumstances change."

Student_B is ranked higher than Student_C, so accepting B weakly dominates accepting C given only one seat. However, Student_E is my top priority and may apply later; I should consider whether rejecting B now could allow matching with E later. Student_E’s preferences rank School_B last, so it is unlikely E will apply to School_B unless rejected everywhere else, and competition for E at other schools is strong. Student_B ranks School_B second (after School_A), so if I reject, B may match elsewhere and I risk ending unmatched. Therefore, accept Student_B now to secure a high-priority match rather than gamble on a very unlikely Student_E application."
