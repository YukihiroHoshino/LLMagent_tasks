However, School_C ranks me 4th, while Student_B and Student_C (who both rank School_C highly) have higher priority there and are likely to apply immediately, so an early application may be rejected. In contrast, School_A ranks me 1st, and although it is my 3rd choice, securing a guaranteed acceptance early prevents ending up at a much worse option if School_C and School_D fill. Therefore I will apply to School_A now to lock in a strong, safe match."

School_C ranks me 1st, making acceptance highly likely if I apply now, and School_C is still my 3rd choice. Securing a strong, safe match early is important given quotas of 1.

Since we can only accept one and accepting A now would block a better-priority match (C or D) who is already applying and would commit, we should reject A to preserve capacity for a higher-ranked student.

I know School_B’s priority order is Student_E > Student_B > Student_C > Student_D > Student_A, so I am ranked 3rd. That means my acceptance depends on whether Student_E and/or Student_B apply there first. Since Student_E’s top choice is School_C and Student_B’s top choice is School_A, there is a good chance neither targets School_B in round 1, making an early application my best shot to secure my first choice."

Accepting Student_C now secures a relatively high-priority match and avoids the risk that Student_C matches elsewhere next round. While Student_B and Student_E are ranked above Student_C, neither has contacted School_B this round; waiting would be speculative and could leave School_B with a lower-ranked student (D or A) or unfilled.
