Student_E does rank School_D as #2, so acceptance would be stable from their side, but our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list. Given early round (5/30) and the possibility of receiving an application from D/A/C later (they all rank School_D mid-to-low but could reach us if rejected elsewhere), it is optimal to continue holding the seat and reject Student_E again rather than commit now."
