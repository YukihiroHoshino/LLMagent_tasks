We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, but accepting Student_E now would lock the seat and prevent us from matching with any higher-priority student (D/A/C) if they approach later. Given the market information, higher-priority students may still be seeking placements, and we have repeatedly rejected Student_E already, signaling we are holding out for higher-priority candidates. With no new information that changes priorities or availability constraints, the optimal strategy to maximize our outcome is to continue rejecting Student_E and keep the seat open for a higher-ranked student."

Given the risk that higher-priority students (D/A/C) are likely pursuing and being accepted by their higher-ranked choices (they all rank School_D low or mid, and several prefer B/C/A/E over D), waiting further may leave my seat unfilled. Since I prefer filling with someone on my list over remaining empty, and Student_E is on my list and is ready to commit immediately, accepting now maximizes expected outcome versus continued delay."
