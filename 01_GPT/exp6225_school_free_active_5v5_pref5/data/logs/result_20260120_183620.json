In the overall market, Student_E ranks School_B last, so E is unlikely to apply here; however E could still end up unmatched or apply late if rejected elsewhere. Student_B ranks School_B second and could plausibly apply if School_A rejects them; School_A’s priority places B relatively low (4th), so B may be displaced and come to us later. If I accept C now, I forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority B (or E).
