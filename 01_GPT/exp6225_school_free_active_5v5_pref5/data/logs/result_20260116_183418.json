However, Student_D (our top choice) ranks School_D last, and Student_A also ranks School_D last; neither is likely to apply soon. Student_C ranks School_D 3rd (after School_B and School_C). School_B prioritizes Student_E and Student_B above Student_C; School_C prioritizes Student_B above Student_C, but has Student_C relatively high. Student_C may be rejected by their top choices and could accept School_D if we offer now. We already rejected Student_E; holding out for Student_D/A risks ending unmatched. Therefore accept Student_C now to secure a high-enough priority match within quota."
