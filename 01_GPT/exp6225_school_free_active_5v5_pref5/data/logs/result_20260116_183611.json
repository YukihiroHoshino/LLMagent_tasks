Student_B’s preferences place School_C as 3rd (after A, B), and Student_C’s preferences place School_C as 2nd (after B). That means Student_C is a plausible future applicant if rejected elsewhere, while Student_B may also come later. But there is no guarantee either will apply, and accepting Student_D now secures a relatively high-ranked candidate (3rd) and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-ranked match or no match.
