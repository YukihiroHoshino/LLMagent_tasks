School_D is my 2nd choice and ranks me 4th as well, but importantly Student_D and Student_A (who are ahead of me at School_D) both strongly prefer School_B/School_C and are likely to match elsewhere. Meanwhile, I am the top priority at School_A and School_B, but those are lower on my true list (A is 3rd, B is last). To maximize my outcome while avoiding an early lock-in to a lower option, I will apply to School_D now as a strong-but-not-too-risky move, aiming to secure my 2nd choice before considering my safety options (especially School_A, where I have top priority)."

Student_E’s own preferences rank School_D as 2nd (after School_C), so even if we accept now we lock in a match, but that could prevent us from matching with a higher-priority student.

Student_E currently ranks School_B last, so is unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second and may apply if not accepted by School_A. Given quota 1, accepting Student_C now would lock me in and could forgo a potential match with Student_B later. Since the game allows up to 30 rounds and there is no penalty stated for waiting, the strategically better move is to reject Student_C now to preserve the seat for Student_B (more plausible than Student_E)."
