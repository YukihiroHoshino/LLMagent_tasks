I also know School_B’s priority list ranks Student_E first and Student_B second, but I am ranked 3rd, which gives me a realistic chance if higher-priority students choose other schools (Student_B’s top choice is School_A; Student_E’s top choice is School_C). Since early commitment matters and there is no downside to applying to my first choice in round 1, I will apply to School_B with a clear, enthusiastic statement of fit and commitment."

Student_C is ranked higher than Student_A, so if I must choose between these two now, C is preferable. However, I have quota 1 and may be able to attract a higher-priority student (E or B) in later rounds. Student_E ranks School_B last, so unlikely to apply; Student_B ranks School_B second (after School_A) and could apply if not accepted by School_A. Student_B is also highly prioritized by School_C, so B may get offers elsewhere. Given uncertainty and the risk of losing a solid high-ranked candidate who has School_B as first choice, accepting Student_C now secures my 3rd-choice within the priority list and avoids ending up with a worse match or unfilled seat later."

Those three students all rank School_C very highly (each has it 2nd), so competition there is intense and I’m unlikely to be accepted if I apply immediately. My #2 choice School_D ranks me 4th, but crucially Student_D (who is School_D’s top priority) prefers School_B/C/A over D, and Student_A prefers B/C/A/E over D, so School_D may be less contested early.

In round 1, only Student_E applied to us, but Student_E’s top choice is School_C and School_D is their 2nd choice, so they may accept elsewhere if possible. Meanwhile, higher-priority students (especially Student_D and Student_A) currently rank School_D last, making it unlikely they will apply here; Student_C ranks School_D 3rd and could come later. With quota 1, accepting Student_E now risks blocking a potentially higher-priority Student_C if they later apply, but the probability of receiving any higher-priority applicant seems low given students’ preference lists. Therefore, accepting Student_E is a reasonable way to secure a match rather than ending unfilled."

Those three are also likely to apply to School_B (A prefers B; C prefers B; B has B as #2; E has B as last so less likely). With capacity 1, my chance at B is low if higher-priority students apply. School_C is my #2 and School_C’s priority ranks me 3rd (behind Student_B and Student_C). Student_B is likely to apply to School_A first; Student_C is likely to apply to School_B first.

Student_D ranks School_A third as well and is making a committed application now. Accepting Student_D secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending with a lower-priority student or no match if we wait for Student_E who may match to School_C/School_D instead.
