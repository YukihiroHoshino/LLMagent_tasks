The top two priorities (Student_E, Student_B) have not applied yet, and both have plausible paths to School_B (Student_B ranks School_B 2nd; Student_E ranks School_B last, so unlikely). With quota 1, accepting Student_D now would block the chance to take Student_C (higher) and possibly Student_B later.

Student_E is likely to apply to School_C first (their top), and Student_B is likely to apply to School_A first (their top).

Student_C is ranked above Student_D and Student_A on my list, so if I accept anyone now, Student_C is the best available. However, Student_E (my top choice) has School_B as their 5th choice and is likely to apply elsewhere; Student_B has School_B as 2nd choice and may come later if rejected by School_A. Waiting could, in theory, yield Student_B, but there is no guarantee they will apply to me before I fill, and rejecting Student_C risks ending up with a lower-ranked match or an unfilled seat. Given quota=1 and that Student_C is a high-priority candidate who is signaling strong commitment, accepting Student_C now best secures a strong outcome."

The most helpful ways to demonstrate fit are:\n- Be specific about what programs/opportunities at School_B you want to take advantage of and why.\n- Highlight sustained commitments (leadership, teamwork, service, or a long-term project) rather than a long list of short activities.\n- Share concrete examples of growth—challenges you faced and how you responded.\n\nSeparately, I want to be transparent that our seat for this cycle is currently filled, so we’re not in a position to make additional offers right now. If your status changes or you have an updated application note you’d like us to consider should space open, feel free to send it.\n\nSincerely,\nSchool_B Admissions",
