All companies share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E). In step 1, Company_A identifies Seeker_A, and Seeker_A applies to Company_B, while Company_B identifies Seeker_A, creating the 2-cycle (Seeker_A, Company_B). So Company_B is taken immediately by Seeker_A regardless of what I do. After removing them, in step 2 Company_A identifies me (Seeker_B). If I rank Company_A first, I apply there and form a direct 2-cycle (me, Company_A), locking in my top choice. Any attempt to rank Company_A lower risks me being cycled into a worse company once Company_A is filled. Therefore I should submit my true ranking with Company_A first; the remaining order can follow my true preferences.",True,Company_A,True,True,1

In Step 1, Seeker_A applies to Company_B and is also each company's top choice, creating a closed loop that assigns Seeker_A to Company_B. In Step 2, the remaining top priority is Seeker_B, who applies to Company_A and is identified by all remaining companies, creating a loop that assigns Seeker_B to Company_A. At that point, the best remaining seat I can still obtain is Company_C (my top true preference), since Company_C remains available and I am the highest-priority remaining seeker. Therefore, submitting my true preference order is optimal and yields Company_C.",True,Company_C,True,True,1

With one seat each, the top three seekers will take their most-preferred distinct firms first, leaving me to compete mainly with Seeker_E for the remaining two firms. If I rank Company_D first, I apply there in Step 1 while Company_D identifies Seeker_A; this creates the closed loop A→B, B→A, which fills A and B and removes Seeker_A immediately. In Step 2, Seeker_B applies to Company_C and is identified by C, so C fills with Seeker_B. Then only Company_D and Company_E remain; I apply to Company_D and Company_D identifies me (highest remaining), so I secure my top choice. Any strategy that does not keep Company_D as my first application risks missing it if I delay and another higher-priority seeker reaches it while it still has capacity.

The only remaining seat is Company_E, and I will be the only remaining job seeker, so in the next step I am admitted to Company_E regardless of how I rank the other companies.
