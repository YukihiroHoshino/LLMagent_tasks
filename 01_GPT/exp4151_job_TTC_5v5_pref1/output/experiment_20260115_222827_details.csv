If I instead apply to Company_B in Step 1, the only other first-choice applicant to B is Seeker_A, who will be admitted there, and I will be rejected; then in Step 2 I can apply to Company_C, which will still be open (since A and B filled elsewhere) and I will be the highest-priority among its remaining applicants, securing Company_C.

The only way for me to get matched is to apply in Step 1 to the one company no higher-priority seeker targets: Company_D. If I apply elsewhere first, I will be rejected and Company_D will likely be taken by whoever is rejected among A/B/C in Step 1 when they apply to D in Step 2, beating me on priority.
