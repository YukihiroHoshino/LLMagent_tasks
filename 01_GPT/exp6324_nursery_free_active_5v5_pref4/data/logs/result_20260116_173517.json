Given the market, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks it 5th (last), Parent_E ranks it 2nd, Parent_C ranks it 3rd. Nursery_D is the top choice for A/C/D/E, so those parents will likely apply to Nursery_D first, and D has top priority for Parent_B, making it plausible B could be taken by Nursery_D if not accepted here. Still, Parent_E is very likely to apply to Nursery_E soon if rejected elsewhere, and we prefer Parent_E over Parent_B. With only round 1 and quota 1, it is worth holding the seat to try for a higher-priority parent (especially Parent_E) rather than locking in Parent_B now."

With quota 1 still open and no match yet, accepting Parent_C now would likely block a higher-priority parent (Parent_D or Parent_E especially) from matching with us later. Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd and Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd, so they may approach if their top choices (mostly Nursery_D/E) do not work out. Therefore, it is strategically better to reject Parent_C again and keep the seat available for higher-priority candidates."

From parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B); Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E); Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd but is lowest priority for me and has been repeatedly rejected. Given Nursery_D is the top choice for most parents and Nursery_B is high for Parent_D, higher-priority parents may not come to me soon, but it’s uncertain. However, rejecting Parent_B risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply. With no other active applicants and round 6, accepting Parent_B secures a match with an acceptable parent rather than remaining empty. Therefore accept Parent_B now."
