I still have quota 1 and no match yet, and the history indicates the place is not finally committed and I have been consistently rejecting lower-priority applicants to preserve the spot. Given the objective to match as high as possible on my true priority list, I should continue to reject Parent_C while keeping the place open for higher-priority candidates."

In the broader market, Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as 2nd choice and could plausibly apply if not matched at Nursery_D; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 3rd and Parent_B ranks Nursery_B 3rd as well. Accepting Parent_C now would block us from matching with any higher-priority parent in the remaining rounds (28-30). Given repeated applications from C and our prior consistent rejections, and no evidence that higher-priority parents are unavailable, the best strategy to maximize expected outcome is to continue rejecting Parent_C and keep the seat open for D/A/B."
