Parent_B also ranks Nursery_C last, indicating weak mutual fit and a higher risk they would prefer/match elsewhere if given the chance. Given we can leave the seat unfilled rather than accept a lower-priority candidate, and there is no indication that higher-priority parents are unavailable, the best strategy is to reject Parent_B again and preserve capacity for higher-priority applicants."
