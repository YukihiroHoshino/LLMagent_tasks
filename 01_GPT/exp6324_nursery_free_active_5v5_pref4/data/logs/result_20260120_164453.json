Parent_C is not likely to stay available long: Nursery_C ranks Parent_C last, Nursery_D ranks Parent_C 4th, Nursery_E ranks Parent_C last, Nursery_B ranks Parent_C 4th—so Parent_C may continue trying other nurseries but could still accept me if I accept now. Waiting in hopes of Parent_E is risky because Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last and is likely to apply to Nursery_D/E/C/B first; I may never receive an application from Parent_E. I already rejected lower-priority Parent_A and Parent_B, so accepting Parent_C now secures a high-priority match and avoids ending unmatched."

Given the market: Parent_D strongly prefers Nursery_D then B then C; Parent_E prefers D/E/C; Parent_A and Parent_B both rank Nursery_C last, meaning B is likely applying here only after being rejected elsewhere and may still be trying other options. Higher-priority candidates for me (D, E, A) may still become available in later rounds, especially if they fail to secure D/E/A. Since I can only accept one and acceptance finalizes the match, it is strategically better to reject Parent_B now and keep capacity for a higher-priority parent who may approach later. I already rejected Parent_C (lowest priority)."

From parents’ preference lists: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B), Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so Parent_A is very unlikely to apply. Parent_D and Parent_E both prefer Nursery_D first; Nursery_D’s top priorities are B then D then E, so D/E may still chase Nursery_D and could end up displaced, potentially applying to us later. However, we are already at round 6, and we have a concrete [APPLY] from Parent_B who will accept immediately. Waiting risks ending unfilled if D/E never come to us.
