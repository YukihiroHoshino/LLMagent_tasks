              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched. Our true priority list is D > E > A > B > C. Parent_B is 4th on our list, and we have repeatedly rejected them while holding the seat for higher-priority families (D/E/A). At round 24, no higher-priority parent is currently applying to us; Parent_C previously applied and was rejected (lower than B). Given the limited remaining rounds and the risk of ending unmatched, it is now optimal to accept Parent_B rather than continue waiting for D/E/A, who have strong preferences for other nurseries and may never apply to Nursery_C. Accepting B secures a match and is better than remaining unfilled."
