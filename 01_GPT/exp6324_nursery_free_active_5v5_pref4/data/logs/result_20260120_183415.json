Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_E 5th (unlikely), Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 2nd (more likely to apply later).

I remain unmatched with quota 1, but accepting C now would forfeit the chance to match with higher-priority Parent_D or Parent_A if they later apply (both rank above C for me). Parent_D lists Nursery_B as their 2nd choice and could plausibly come to me if Nursery_D rejects them; Parent_A ranks me 3rd and could also come later. Given there are still rounds remaining (19/30) and I have explicitly been holding for higher-priority families, it is strategically better to continue waiting rather than lock in a lower-priority match. Therefore I should reject Parent_C’s [APPLY] while being transparent that we are holding for higher-priority candidates and cannot offer a deadline guarantee."

There is no evidence here that higher-priority parents are matched already, and Parent_D in particular ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice, so it is plausible they may come to me after attempting Nursery_D.
