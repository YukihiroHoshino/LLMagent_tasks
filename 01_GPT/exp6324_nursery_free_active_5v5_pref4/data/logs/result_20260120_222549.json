I have already applied multiple times and been rejected due to priority ordering, but the nursery indicated they reassess round-by-round and suggested checking in again in a few rounds or submitting another formal application later. Since we are in round 13 and there is still a single unfilled place, I will submit a renewed formal application emphasizing immediate acceptance and asking them to reassess based on who is still active, while keeping the tone respectful and non-pushy."

              "thought": "Nursery_C priority order is D > E > A > B > C. Current inbox only has Parent_B applying; Parent_B is acceptable but not top. However, by round 13, higher-priority parents (D, E, A) have strong preferences for other nurseries and likely have matched elsewhere; also Parent_B has repeatedly applied, indicating persistence and immediate acceptance. With only one remaining unmatched nursery, leaving the seat unfilled risks no match at all. Accepting Parent_B now secures a match and is within the true list. Given no evidence higher-priority parents will apply to Nursery_C (it is low on their preference lists), the expected value of waiting is low."
