Although Parent_B is a desirable fallback, accepting now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with Parent_D or Parent_A if they approach later.

Since we still have quota and rounds remaining, it is strategically better to keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates rather than accept Parent_B now.

Since Nursery_C prefers leaving the seat unfilled over taking someone outside the list (and Parent_C is within the list but last), the optimal strategy is still to hold for higher-priority candidates until the end, then only accept Parent_C if no better candidate applies. Given no evidence any higher-priority parent has applied to Nursery_C yet, but there remains one round, reject again while keeping door open to reapply in round 30 if still unfilled."

As this is the final round, I wanted to submit a formal application one last time for your remaining place.\n\nNursery_C remains our top remaining choice. If offered the place, we will ACCEPT immediately the same day and can complete all paperwork right away. We are also fully comfortable with any short, time-limited confirmation window you set (24 hours or shorter).\n\nIf your higher-priority outreach has still not fully closed and you are now able to finalize the place, we would be grateful to be considered as an immediate-confirmation family so the spot does not remain unfilled.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_C",

Given it is the final round, a formal application is the only chance to secure a match.

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and true priority list ranks Parent_C last. There are no other applicants in the inbox this final round, and accepting Parent_C would fill the seat but yields the lowest-priority match. The nursery prefers leaving the position unfilled rather than accepting someone not in the list; Parent_C is in the list but is still strictly dominated by any of Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B. Throughout the cycle we have consistently held the place for higher-priority families and never received closure; however, in the final round there is no mechanism left to secure a higher-priority parent, and we have no confirmation from them. Given the objective to match as high as possible, accepting Parent_C now would lock in the worst possible match; but leaving unfilled preserves the priority objective. Therefore, reject."
