No other applicants in inbox this round, but accepting B now could block a higher-priority parent (D/E/A) who may still apply in later rounds. From parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd, Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd, Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_C 2nd (but already rejected and is lowest priority anyway). Higher-priority threats are D and E; they currently prefer Nursery_D first (and E also likes Nursery_E second), so they may be pursuing other nurseries, but could come to C if rejected elsewhere. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should continue holding for D/E/A rather than accept B now, especially as we previously stated we would reassess but did not commit to offering. Therefore reject B again while keeping waitlist language."
