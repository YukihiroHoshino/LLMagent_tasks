However, higher-priority parents for Nursery_A are Parent_E (1st), Parent_C (2nd), and Parent_D (3rd). Looking at parents’ preferences, Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th, and Parent_E ranks Nursery_A 5th, making it less likely they will apply soon unless rejected elsewhere.

Given full market info: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_D) and could plausibly come to us if rejected by Nursery_D; Parent_A ranks us 3rd and could also come if Nursery_D/Nursery_A don’t work out. Accepting Parent_B now would forgo the chance to match with Parent_D or Parent_A, which is against our objective. Since we are allowed to remain unmatched rather than accept a lower-priority parent, we should continue to reject Parent_B until higher-priority options are exhausted or time is near the end.

In other words, there isn’t a specific point at which we can definitively rule out higher-priority applications until the process ends.\n\nPractically, the only time we can finalize is when we receive an [APPLY] and, at that moment, there is no active/received application from a higher-priority family that would take precedence. If you decide to submit an [APPLY] again, we will respond immediately based on our priority order and the applications on hand at that time.\n\nWe understand this uncertainty is difficult, and we encourage you to continue pursuing other options in parallel.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_B Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
