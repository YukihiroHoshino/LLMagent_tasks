We can start immediately and remain pre-committed to 5 full days (Mon–Fri), full-day hours.\n\nWith thanks,\nParent_C",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_C remains unmatched in the final round, and it is my 2nd true choice. I have already applied multiple times and been rejected, with Nursery_C indicating they are prioritizing higher-ranked families and the status is still pending. In round 30, the best remaining action is a concise, non-pushy TALK message that reiterates I am fully offer-ready, confirms immediate availability, and asks for a final high-level status/possibility before the market ends—without repeating another formal application that is likely to be rejected again."

If you confirm acceptance in writing today, we will send the contract and deposit instructions immediately (with completion within 24 hours / next business day, as previously discussed).\n\nWe have noted your pre-commitment to 5 full days (Mon–Fri), full-day hours, with an immediate start (or a start date we specify).\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_C is last on Nursery_C’s true priority list. In round 30 (final round), no other parents contacted Nursery_C this round, and Nursery_C remains unmatched with quota 1. With no opportunity to secure a higher-priority parent (Parent_D/E/A/B) via further rounds, leaving the seat unfilled is dominated by accepting Parent_C because Parent_C is still on the acceptable list and yields a match rather than an empty seat. Parent_C is offer-ready and pre-committed to a schedule, so acceptance can be finalized immediately."
