However, accepting Parent_B now would forfeit the chance to match with any higher-priority parent if they apply in later rounds; given Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks it 5th, and Parent_E ranks it 2nd, there remains a realistic possibility (especially Parent_E) could return to apply if not matched elsewhere. Since our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list and we prefer to keep the spot open rather than commit to a lower-priority candidate, we should continue rejecting Parent_B while inviting them to apply again in future rounds if still interested."
