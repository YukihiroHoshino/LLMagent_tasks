Parent_B has not applied this round and ranks Nursery_D 4th, so they are unlikely to apply soon and may match elsewhere (Nursery_E/A/B) first. Given I have a top-tier option (Parent_D, my #2) applying now and they state Nursery_D is their first choice, accepting secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of losing them to another nursery in later rounds.

Under Nursery_B true priority list, Parent_C ranks 4th (after Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_B). Accepting Parent_C now would forgo the possibility of matching with higher-priority parents if they apply in later rounds. Given the repeated pattern that higher-priority families may still be applying (or could apply) and we have consistently rejected Parent_C to preserve the slot, and there is no penalty stated for remaining unmatched until round 30, the optimal strategy to maximize match quality is to continue rejecting Parent_C and keep the place open for Parent_D/Parent_A/Parent_B. Parent_C is acceptable but not high enough to justify locking in now."
