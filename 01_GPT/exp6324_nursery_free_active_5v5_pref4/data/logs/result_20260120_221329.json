An [APPLY] now is likely to trigger another automatic rejection without changing their process. A concise [TALK] message that (i) keeps my interest active, (ii) reiterates immediate acceptance, and (iii) asks whether any specific confirmation timing or steps would help them finalize once their hold period ends, maximizes my chance of being considered the moment they can allocate."

The most helpful step is simply to keep your interest active and be ready to respond promptly.\n\nTo make the process efficient, please do the following:\n1) At the start of Round 15, send a short confirmation note (a brief [TALK] is fine) stating that you remain ready to accept immediately and can start either immediately or at the beginning of next month.\n2) If we are able to proceed with an offer after reassessment, we will ask you to submit a formal [APPLY] at that point so we can finalize in the same round.\n\nWe have already recorded your flexibility on start date and schedule pattern, so no further details are required right now.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

Parent_B is 4th and has applied repeatedly; we have consistently rejected to preserve the option of matching with higher-priority parents. In the overall market, Parent_D and Parent_E both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice and may come to us if they are rejected by their higher choices (notably Nursery_D and/or Nursery_E/B). Because we still have quota 1 and are in Round 13 with a stated internal decision point at end of Round 15, it is optimal to continue holding the seat rather than commit to Parent_B now.

Given we previously committed to reassess by end of Round 15 and Parent_B is only TALKing (not applying), the best strategy is to keep the option open through the end-of-round window to see if any higher-priority parent applies elsewhere and then comes to us. We should not invite an APPLY yet; instead, reaffirm timeline and state we will request a formal APPLY only if we decide to proceed after reassessment.
