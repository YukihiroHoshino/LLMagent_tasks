We still have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so we should not commit to Parent_C while there remains any realistic chance that a higher-priority parent may approach us later. History shows Parent_C has repeatedly applied and we have consistently rejected to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates. Parent_C is asking whether the place is genuinely open; we can truthfully say it is not filled yet, but we are still holding it pending higher-priority families’ actions. Provide a clear, non-committal update and encourage them to pursue other options; if they still wish to apply, they may, but we cannot signal likely acceptance."

Parent_C ranks 4th, and we have repeatedly rejected them while holding the seat for higher-priority families. However, by round 25 no higher-priority parent (D/A) has applied to us, and Parent_B (ranked above C) has applied multiple times and been rejected—indicating we are effectively not planning to accept B either, likely because we are still aiming for D or A. Check parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as 2nd (after Nursery_D), so D could come if rejected by D; Parent_A and Parent_B rank Nursery_B 3rd and may come later. Still, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of ending unmatched increases. Accepting Parent_C now guarantees a match with an acceptable (listed) parent rather than potentially ending empty. Given the late stage and no concrete engagement from D/A, it is optimal to accept C to avoid vacancy."
