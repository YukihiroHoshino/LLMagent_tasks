[REJECT]\n\nIn response to your question: we are still proceeding in line with our internal priority order and are not in a position today to move to an offer for your family.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C",
              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and true priority order: D > E > A > B > C. Parent_C is last on our list, and we prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting someone not in the list; while C is in the list, accepting them would block any chance (however small) of matching with a higher-priority parent. Parent_C has applied repeatedly and we have consistently rejected to preserve the option for higher-priority families. In round 30, no higher-priority parent has applied to us in the inbox, but given our stated adherence to priority and the long-standing ongoing discussions with higher-priority families, we should remain consistent and reject rather than accept a lowest-priority applicant at the final moment. This maintains strategy of holding for higher-priority match or leaving unfilled."
