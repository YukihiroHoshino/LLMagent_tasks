Between them, Parent_A is preferred over Parent_B, so if choosing now, accept Parent_A. However, higher-priority candidates (E, C, D) may apply later; accepting Parent_A would end our search and could forgo a better match. Check parents' preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—so none are likely to apply early, but they might if rejected elsewhere. Still, we cannot hold a spot without accepting; rejecting Parent_A risks ending unmatched if no one else applies, but market has 5 nurseries/5 parents so everyone will match and Parent_A may not return. Given only round 2 and our strong preference for E/C/D, but low likelihood they choose us, the safer strategy to secure a decent match is to accept Parent_A now (4th on our list) rather than gamble. Also Parent_B already rejected; accepting Parent_A avoids being stuck with Parent_B if Parent_A goes elsewhere."

We cannot confirm within this conversation whether that process will fully finalize before the simulation closes, and the system may continue to display “unmatched/available” until the final step is recorded.\n\nTo reiterate for clarity and closure: your file remains closed, and we will not be reopening consideration or inviting a fresh application for this place at the end of the process.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Parent_C is last on Nursery_C’s true priority list, and we have repeatedly and explicitly closed their file and stated we will not reopen consideration even if the place remains unfilled. In Round 30 they sent [TALK], not [APPLY], so we must respond with [TALK]. With no other inbound candidates this round and the simulation ending, there is no strategic benefit to reversing position; consistency and adherence to stated priority-based process dominates."
