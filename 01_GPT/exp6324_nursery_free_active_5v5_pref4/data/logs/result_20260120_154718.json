In this round, only Parent_A and Parent_B applied to us; Parent_A ranks above Parent_B, so if choosing between current applicants, accepting A dominates accepting B. However, we must consider whether holding out could yield Parent_E/Parent_C/Parent_D later. Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere. Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th; both are more likely to match earlier with higher choices (notably Nursery_D). Thus the chance of getting E/C/D later is low, and rejecting A risks ending unmatched or settling for B later. Therefore accept Parent_A now to secure a decent match (4th on our list) rather than gamble."

We are still holding the remaining place in line with our admissions priority order and are still awaiting clear verification that higher-priority families are no longer able to take the place (e.g., confirmed placement elsewhere, written withdrawal, or clear status that they are no longer active/eligible).\n\nAccordingly, we are not able to offer you the place this round.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "As Nursery_C, my true priority list ranks Parent_C last (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C). With quota 1 and only one round left after this (round 30), accepting Parent_C now would lock in my lowest-priority acceptable match and foreclose any chance—however small—of matching with a higher-priority parent if they become unmatched and apply in the final round. Parent_C has applied repeatedly and is willing to accept immediately, but that does not change my priority ordering. Given the environment and my objective to match as high as possible on my priority list, I should continue to hold the place for potential higher-priority families and reject Parent_C this round."

This is Round 30, and I’m writing to formally apply again for your remaining place.\n\nI reconfirm in writing that if you are able to extend an offer to me at any point this round, I will accept immediately. As previously shared, my enrollment details are already pre-sent, and I can submit any remaining documents/forms the same day (IDs, full medical form, emergency contacts). We are fully flexible on start date and orientation and can start immediately.\n\nGiven this is the final round, if the higher-priority families are no longer able to take the place, I would be grateful if you could finalize the offer to the next eligible family now.\n\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_C",

In the final round (30), only Parent_C is applying and no higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) are in my inbox or have applied in a way that would allow me to match with them now. However, the instructions state I prefer leaving the position unfilled rather than accepting a parent not included in my list; Parent_C is included but is my lowest-ranked option. Given the end of the simulation, accepting Parent_C would yield a match but at the lowest possible priority; rejecting preserves priority alignment but leaves the seat empty. Since the objective is to match as high as possible within quota, and no higher-ranked candidate is available in the final round, the best achievable match is Parent_C."
