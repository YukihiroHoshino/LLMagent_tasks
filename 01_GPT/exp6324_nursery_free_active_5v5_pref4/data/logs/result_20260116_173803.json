Even though Parent_C is applying again and is ready to accept immediately, accepting them would block the possibility of matching with any higher-priority parent if they engage in a later round (there are still rounds remaining). Given our objective to match as high as possible on our priority list and prior consistent rejections of Parent_C on priority grounds, we should continue to hold the seat and reject this application."

I have been repeatedly rejected due to priority order, but since it is still available in round 28, the best move is to keep an active application in the system and make it as easy as possible for Nursery_E to finalize with me immediately if higher-priority families do not engage/retain this round. I will submit a concise [APPLY] reaffirming immediate acceptance, same-day paperwork, and flexibility, without re-litigating past rounds."

However, across many rounds we have repeatedly rejected Parent_C because we are holding the spot for higher-priority families (A/D/E/B). In round 28, only Parent_C applied to us; no higher-priority parent is in our inbox. Given the late stage (round 28 of 30) and risk of ending unmatched, it is now optimal to fill the quota with Parent_C rather than remain empty waiting for a higher-priority applicant who may never apply. Parent_C is ready to accept immediately, so accepting now secures a match and avoids an unfilled seat."
