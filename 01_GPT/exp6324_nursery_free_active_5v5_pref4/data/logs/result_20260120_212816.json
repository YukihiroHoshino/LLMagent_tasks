With quota 1, accepting Parent_E now would block a potentially higher-ranked Parent_A or Parent_D if they apply later. However, rejecting Parent_E risks ending unmatched if no higher-priority parents apply to Nursery_E, but Parent_E lists Nursery_E as 2nd choice (after Nursery_D), so they may be taken by Nursery_D if they apply there. Given Nursery_D is highly demanded and Parent_E is not top priority there (Nursery_D ranks Parent_E 3rd), Parent_E might still be available, but uncertainty remains. Still, to maximize chance of matching with a higher-ranked parent, reject Parent_E now and keep capacity open, since Parent_E is not top-2 on our list and we already have another applicant; we can potentially revisit if still available later, but rules don’t allow holding. Strategy: reject politely, encourage them to keep us updated if still seeking placement."

In round 2, only Parent_A applied again; no competing applicants in inbox. To maximize chance of higher-priority, we should reject Parent_A now and wait, since accepting is binding in this simulation. Risk: ending unmatched.

Given Nursery_B’s priority order places Parent_A second (after Parent_D), I have a plausible chance if Parent_D is not applying there or is accepted elsewhere. I should submit a clear, ready-to-commit application emphasizing immediate confirmation and flexibility to strengthen my candidacy."

Waiting in hopes of Parent_D is risky because Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice but likely applies to Nursery_D first (their top), where Nursery_D ranks Parent_D as 2nd and may accept them. If Parent_D gets accepted elsewhere, we could lose the chance to fill our seat with a high-priority parent. Accepting Parent_A now secures a very desirable match within our priority list and avoids ending up with a lower-ranked option later."
