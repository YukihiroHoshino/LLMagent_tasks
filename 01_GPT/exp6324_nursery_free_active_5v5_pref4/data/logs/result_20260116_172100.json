However, it may be possible to obtain a higher-priority match (D/E/A) later if we keep the seat open; accepting B now would lock in and forgo any chance at D/E/A. Check parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B), Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so A is unlikely to apply. D and E could still end up applying if rejected elsewhere, but not guaranteed. Given we are already at round 9 of 30 and have an acceptable candidate (B) who is in our list and preferable to remaining applicant C, it is safer to accept B now rather than risk ending unmatched or forced to accept C later.

Since higher-priority candidates could still appear in later rounds, we should continue to hold the spot but provide Parent_C with a clear operational cutoff to be fair and to keep them engaged.
