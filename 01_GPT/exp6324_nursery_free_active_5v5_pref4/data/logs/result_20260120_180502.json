However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_E as their 1st choice, making acceptance likely final and reducing uncertainty. Still, higher-priority parents (A, D, E) may apply later; notably A ranks Nursery_E 4th, D ranks it 5th (least), E ranks it 2nd—so E is the most plausible higher-priority future applicant. Since we can only decide accept/reject now, and rejecting risks ending unmatched if no one returns, but accepting locks in a lower-priority match. Given E is likely to apply to D first and may or may not reach us, while B is committed now, accept to secure a match rather than gamble."

Parent_D is my #2 choice among all parents, and Parent_B (my #1) has not applied to me this round and in their preferences ranks Nursery_D 4th, so they are unlikely to come soon (they prefer E, A, B first). Since Parent_D ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice and has applied formally, accepting now secures a very high-priority match with low risk. Rejecting or delaying to wait for Parent_B is risky and could leave me with a lower-ranked match later if Parent_D matches elsewhere. Therefore I should accept Parent_D."

Parent_A’s top choice is Nursery_D, so they may be shopping; however they have already applied here. Given no other current applicants in inbox, I could accept to secure a match, but strategic holdout is better because higher-priority parents might not have strong options elsewhere: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last so unlikely to apply; Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—both could still come later.
