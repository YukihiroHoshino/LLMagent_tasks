We are not yet at a point where we need to broaden consideration in order to ensure the place is filled, and we can’t predict in advance whether/when that would change.\n\nIf you remain interested, the best next step is exactly what you suggested: if you want to be considered in any round where we do broaden, you may submit an [APPLY] in that round. In parallel, I encourage you to continue pursuing your other options given the uncertainty.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Parent_C is the lowest on Nursery_C’s true priority list (D > E > A > B > C). We still have quota 1 and no matched parent yet. Accepting Parent_C now would prevent matching with any higher-priority parent if they apply later (especially Parent_D or Parent_E, who both rank Nursery_C reasonably high: Parent_D has Nursery_C as 3rd; Parent_E has Nursery_C as 3rd). With rounds remaining (28-30), it is still optimal to keep the seat for higher-priority families rather than lock in the lowest-priority option. Parent_C is only [TALK] this round, so we respond with [TALK] and continue to indicate reservation for higher-priority families without revealing others’ status."

Although we prefer leaving unfilled rather than taking someone not on the list, Parent_C is on the list, so acceptable as a last resort. However, accepting now could block a higher-priority parent (D/E/A/B) if they apply in round 30. Given Parent_C has applied repeatedly and is ready to accept immediately, we can still hold out one more round to maximize chance of a higher-priority match. Therefore reject in round 29 to preserve option value for round 30; if no higher-priority applies then, accept Parent_C as fallback."
