At this stage, the main factor driving our decision is our placement priority order (i.e., we must offer the remaining place first to families who are higher in our priority ranking). Because that ordering is fixed, additional information about start date flexibility, schedule, or transition support typically won’t change your position relative to other applicants.\n\nThat said, to ensure your file is fully “ready” in case we are able to make an offer later, the practical items that can matter are: (1) confirming your child’s age/eligibility for the intake group, (2) any required documentation being complete, and (3) your ability to accept promptly if contacted.\n\nIf you’d like, please reply with your child’s birth month/year and your preferred start window, and we’ll confirm eligibility/fit on our side. I also encourage you to continue pursuing other options in parallel, since we cannot guarantee availability for you this round.\n\nThank you again for your patience and continued interest in Nursery_C.",

Still, D/E could come if rejected elsewhere. Since Parent_C sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK], be transparent that decisions are priority-based and that additional info likely won't change ranking, but we can note standard factors (eligibility/docs) and encourage them to keep options open."
