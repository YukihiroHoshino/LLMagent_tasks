With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now would foreclose the chance to match with any higher-priority parent who may apply in later rounds. Given our stated strategy in prior rounds (holding for higher-priority families) and consistency, we should reject Parent_C again and keep the seat open."

In this round we received applications from Parent_C and Parent_B; between them, Parent_B is higher priority than Parent_C. However, accepting Parent_B now could block a potential match with higher-priority parents (D/E/A) if they apply later. Check parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B), Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so A is unlikely to apply. D and E might still come if rejected elsewhere, but after 14 rounds and with no contact from D/E, the probability may be declining. Parent_B has applied twice and is ready to confirm immediately; securing Parent_B is preferable to remaining empty or eventually taking Parent_C. Given round 14 and the need to fill the seat with the best available applicant, accept Parent_B now."

Holding out longer risks ending unmatched, while accepting Parent_C yields a better outcome than remaining empty. Parent_C also credibly commits to accept immediately. Therefore accept Parent_C now to secure a match within quota 1."
