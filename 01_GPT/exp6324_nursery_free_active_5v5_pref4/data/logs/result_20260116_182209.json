However, on Nursery_E’s true priority list Parent_B is 4th (behind Parent_A, Parent_D, Parent_E). Given the market: Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks it 5th (last), Parent_E ranks it 2nd, and Parent_C ranks it 3rd. Nursery_D is the top choice for A/C/D/E, so they will likely apply to Nursery_D first; if rejected there, Parent_E is the most plausible high-priority candidate to come to us next (since we are their #2). Also, Nursery_D’s priority puts Parent_E 3rd and Parent_C 4th, so Parent_E could be rejected by D depending on competition. Therefore, it is strategically better to keep the seat open rather than lock in Parent_B now, in hopes of matching with Parent_E (or possibly Parent_A) later. Since the protocol requires an immediate accept/reject on an [APPLY], we should reject Parent_B to preserve capacity for higher-priority parents."
