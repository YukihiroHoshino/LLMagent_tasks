Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—both may approach later if they fail at their top choices (notably Nursery_D).

Parent_B is currently only [TALK]ing; no need to decide accept/reject now.

Parent_C has repeatedly applied and is willing to accept immediately, but accepting now would prevent matching with any higher-priority parent (especially Parent_D or Parent_A) if they approach in remaining rounds. Given we are at round 27 (close to end), we weigh risk of ending unmatched versus waiting. However, Parent_C ranks Nursery_B last and has other higher preferences, suggesting they may still be pursuing other options, while higher-priority parents for us (D/A/B) might still become available if rejected elsewhere. Since we still prefer to hold for higher-priority candidates and have been consistently rejecting C/B previously, maintain strategy and reject this round as well."

Given the market preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as 2nd and is our top choice; Parent_A ranks us 3rd; Parent_B ranks us 3rd; Parent_C ranks us last. In a DA-like environment, holding out could still yield Parent_D or Parent_A if they become unmatched/unsatisfied late, which would be a strictly better outcome for Nursery_B than accepting Parent_C now. History shows Parent_C has repeatedly applied and we have consistently rejected while holding for higher-priority families; changing to accept now would be inconsistent with our stated approach absent new information that higher-priority candidates are no longer possible. With only two rounds left (28–30), there is some risk of ending unmatched, but our objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list; we still prefer to wait for Parents D/A/B. Therefore reject Parent_C again."

With one round left (29/30) and no higher-priority applicants in this round’s inbox, the key tradeoff is accepting Parent_C now versus holding out one more round for Parent_D/Parent_A/Parent_B. Given long history: Parent_B has applied repeatedly and been rejected; Parent_C has also applied repeatedly. Parent_D (our top choice) prefers Nursery_D then Nursery_B, so there is a plausible chance they may come to us if rejected/unsuccessful at Nursery_D late. Parent_A and Parent_B rank Nursery_B 3rd; Parent_B has been actively pursuing us, suggesting they may still be unmatched and could apply again; but Parent_B is higher priority than Parent_C. Since we can still reject now and potentially accept a higher-priority parent in round 30, and we prefer higher-priority matches, the optimal strategy is to reject Parent_C this round and keep the seat for a potential higher-priority applicant in the final round."
