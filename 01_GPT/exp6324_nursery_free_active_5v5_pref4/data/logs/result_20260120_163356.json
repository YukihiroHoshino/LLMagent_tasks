Could you please confirm whether you received any new formal [APPLY] messages this round from the higher-priority families (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B), and whether you are now aware of any definitive matches elsewhere for any of them?\n\nAlso, can you please confirm that your earlier guidance still holds that round 22 is the earliest point you would begin considering the next unmatched family in priority order if no higher-priority applications arrive? If so, I will submit a formal [APPLY] immediately at the start of round 22 and can accept and complete enrollment the same day.",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_C remains available and it is my 2nd true choice. Nursery_C has repeatedly stated they will realistically consider the next unmatched family starting around round 22 if no higher-priority applicants appear. Applying in round 21 is likely to be rejected again and could be seen as disregarding their stated process, so I will send a brief TALK to confirm no changes and to signal I will submit a formal APPLY immediately at the start of round 22."

Only Parent_C is contacting us, and they are last on our list, so accepting now risks missing any higher-priority parent who may still apply. However, we previously communicated a credible earliest reconsideration point around round 22 if no higher-priority applications arrive and no definitive evidence they remain in play. In round 21, still no higher-priority APPLYs and no confirmed matches elsewhere. To preserve our objective while maintaining consistency, we should continue TALK, confirm no new APPLYs, no definitive updates, and reaffirm round 22 as earliest consideration point, inviting Parent_C to APPLY in round 22 for immediate decision."
