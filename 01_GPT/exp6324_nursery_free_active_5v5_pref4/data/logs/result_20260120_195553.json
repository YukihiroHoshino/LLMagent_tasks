Given we are still only at round 14 of 30 and have repeatedly signaled we are holding for higher-priority families, the optimal move is to continue rejecting Parent_B to preserve the slot for Parent_D/Parent_A."

Nursery_D is highly demanded (top choice for A,C,D,E and 4th for B), so D will likely fill quickly but Parent_D could still be in play if not accepted by D. With 15 rounds remaining, holding the seat preserves the chance to match with D or A, which is better than matching with B now.

Given Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice and Parent_A ranks Nursery_B as their 3rd choice, there remains a plausible chance they may apply if they are rejected elsewhere or remain unmatched. With rounds remaining (24/30), and consistent past rejections to preserve the seat for higher-priority candidates, the best strategy to maximize priority outcome is to continue holding the seat and reject Parent_B again."

However, accepting B now could block a higher-priority Parent_D or Parent_A if they apply in remaining rounds. Check parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 2nd (after D) so could plausibly apply if rejected by Nursery_D; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 3rd; both are realistic late applicants. With quota 1 and no indication higher-priority candidates are matched elsewhere, it remains optimal to hold the seat rather than accept Parent_B at round 25, despite the risk of ending unmatched by round 30. Given repeated history, maintain consistent rejection while leaving door open to reapply later if still unfilled."

Given the rules, there is no penalty for remaining unmatched this round, and Nursery_B prefers holding the seat for higher-priority candidates rather than locking in a lower-priority match.
