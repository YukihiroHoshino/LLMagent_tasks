Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_D), so if they fail to secure Nursery_D they may apply to us; Parent_A ranks us 3rd and could also come if their higher choices reject them.

I should only accept C if I believe higher-priority parents (D, A, B) are unlikely to apply/accept me going forward. From parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_B 2nd (after Nursery_D), so D could come to me if rejected by D. Parent_A ranks Nursery_B 3rd and Parent_B ranks Nursery_B 3rd; both could still approach if their higher choices don’t work out. Given we are at Round 19 but still many rounds remain, holding the seat preserves the chance to match with D or A (or even B ahead of C). History shows repeated applications from B and rejections; C has also applied repeatedly. Accepting C now would lock in a lower-priority match and foreclose a better one. Therefore, reject C while maintaining that we are still holding for higher-priority families; provide a clear but non-committal timeline (cannot commit to a round)."

However, by Round 20 Nursery_B is the only unmatched nursery; this suggests Parent_D and Parent_A have likely already matched elsewhere (both rank Nursery_B highly, especially Parent_D who lists it 2nd, so if they were unmatched they would likely have applied by now). Parent_B has repeatedly applied and been rejected; Parent_C is currently applying and is higher priority than Parent_E but lower than Parent_B. Still, the main risk is only D or A. Given the late stage and the strong signal that higher-priority parents are not coming, it is optimal to fill the seat with Parent_C rather than remain unmatched through Round 30."
