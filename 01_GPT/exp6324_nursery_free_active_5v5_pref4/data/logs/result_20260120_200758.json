We are pleased to offer your family a place at Nursery_C.\n\nPlease reply to confirm your start date and schedule needs, and we will send the enrollment packet and next steps for completing paperwork.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",

In the current round, the only applicant in my inbox is Parent_E, and I have remaining quota 1 with no matches yet. Waiting for Parent_D is risky because Parent_D prefers Nursery_D and Nursery_B over Nursery_C, so they may never apply. Accepting Parent_E now secures a high-priority match and avoids ending unmatched or being forced to consider lower-ranked parents later. Therefore, accept Parent_E."
