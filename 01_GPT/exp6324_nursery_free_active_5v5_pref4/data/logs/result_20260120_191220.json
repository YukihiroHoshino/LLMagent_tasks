In this round, only Parent_C contacted us and only with [TALK], so we cannot form a match anyway. Given the market info, those higher-priority parents all rank Nursery_C low (mostly last or near last), so it is unlikely they will apply, but it is still possible in the final rounds if they fail elsewhere. Since we previously committed to a late-stage review around rounds 28–29 and to moving immediately if higher-priority families become unavailable, the best strategy is to maintain the hold for one more round and reiterate the plan, keeping Parent_C warm without committing prematurely."

As you begin your late-stage review in Round 28, I would like to submit a formal application again for the remaining place.\n\nNursery_C is my top remaining choice, and if you are able to extend the offer to me this round, I will accept immediately in the same round and withdraw from any other options. I can attend a visit within 24–48 hours (or sooner if needed) and I can complete all paperwork and any required deposit/payment immediately in the same round.\n\nIf your Round 28 market-status review indicates that the higher-priority families (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) have not applied and it appears unlikely they will before Round 30, I would be very grateful if you could proceed to the next eligible family and make the offer now so the place does not go unfilled.\n\nThank you again for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_C",
              "thought": "Nursery_C is my highest-ranked remaining option (2nd overall) and the only unmatched nursery. Past rejections were due to holding the seat for higher-priority families, and Nursery_C indicated a late-stage review around Rounds 28–29 where they may extend an offer down the list if the place is still unfilled and higher-priority families have not applied. Therefore, I should submit a formal application now in Round 28, reiterating immediate acceptance and readiness to complete visit/paperwork/deposit the same round to maximize my chance of being chosen in their late-stage decision."

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and remains unmatched in Round 28. Our true priority list ranks Parent_C last (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B, then Parent_C). No higher-priority parents have applied to us across many rounds, and we have no verifiable confirmation they are matched elsewhere; however, with only Rounds 28–30 remaining, the risk of ending unfilled is high. Parent_C has repeatedly signaled immediate acceptance and ability to complete visit/paperwork/deposit quickly, making them a reliable late-stage match. Given the late-stage review commitment (Rounds 28–29) and absence of higher-priority applications to date, accepting Parent_C now maximizes the chance of filling the seat versus holding out and potentially remaining unmatched."
