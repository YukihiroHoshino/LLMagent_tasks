In this round I have applications from Parent_A and Parent_B; among them, Parent_A is ranked higher than Parent_B, so if I must choose between these two, A is preferable. However, accepting Parent_A now would fill my only quota and prevent me from matching with higher-priority parents (E, C, or D) who may still be available. Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, and Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th, so they are unlikely to approach me early, but they could if rejected elsewhere. Meanwhile Parent_A ranks me 2nd and is actively applying, meaning I risk losing Parent_A if I reject. Still, my objective is to match as high as possible on my priority list; Parent_A is only 4th. With rounds remaining and the possibility (even if modest) that E/C/D could come later after rejections from their top choices (notably Nursery_D and others), it is rational to keep the seat open and reject Parent_A now to preserve the chance of a higher-priority match. If no higher-priority parent applies later, I can consider Parent_A or Parent_B in subsequent rounds if they re-apply."
