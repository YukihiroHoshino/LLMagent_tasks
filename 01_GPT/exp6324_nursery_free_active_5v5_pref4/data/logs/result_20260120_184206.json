While we explored other options earlier in the process, we would be genuinely happy to join Nursery_C and commit promptly if offered a spot. We value a calm, supportive environment and consistent routines, and we can be flexible on start date, hours, and any visit/interview requirements. I can provide all documents immediately. Thank you very much for considering our application.",

Since I have already been rejected by my higher-ranked options and Nursery_C still has capacity, the best strategy to secure a match (preferred to being unmatched) is to submit a clear, polite formal application emphasizing readiness and fit."

We have reviewed your request and are pleased to offer you our available place at Nursery_C.\n\n[ACTION] [ACCEPT]\n\nPlease confirm acceptance and we will send the enrollment packet and arrange the next steps (documents and start-date details).",

Now Parent_B applies; B is 4th on our list, acceptable but not ideal. However, holding out carries risk: Parent_D and Parent_E both rank Nursery_C as 3rd and may never reach us if they secure Nursery_D/B/E earlier. Parent_A ranks us last and is unlikely to apply. With no higher-priority applicants currently in inbox and rounds progressing, accepting Parent_B secures a match rather than risking an unfilled seat. Therefore accept Parent_B."
