Given the long horizon remaining (up to round 30) and that higher-priority parents may still be negotiating with their top choices (many rank Nursery_C mid-high), it is optimal to continue holding the seat rather than accept the lowest-priority parent now. Also consistent with prior commitments to follow priority order and only move down when higher-priority families are no longer in play; we still cannot verify that condition. Therefore reject again while keeping tone respectful and encouraging them to pursue other options."
