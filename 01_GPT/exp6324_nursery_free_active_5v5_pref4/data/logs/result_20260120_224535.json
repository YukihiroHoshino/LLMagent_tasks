Our approach is to keep the place available while there remains a realistic chance that a higher-priority family for Nursery_C may still engage/apply in the remaining rounds.\n\nThe main signal that would change things is simply the passage of additional rounds without any engagement/applications from those higher-priority families, combined with indications that they are likely to be placed elsewhere. If we reach a point later in the process where it appears the place would otherwise remain unfilled, we will reassess at that time.\n\nI understand that this is not the firm deadline you’re hoping for.

              "thought": "Nursery_C has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. Its true priority list ranks Parent_C last, but still acceptable. No other parents contacted Nursery_C this round, and with the simulation at round 29 (near the end), the probability of higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) newly engaging with Nursery_C in time is low. Continuing to hold risks ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with an included (though lowest-priority) parent. Parent_C has repeatedly demonstrated immediate-accept readiness. Since Parent_C sent [TALK], I should respond with [TALK] and explicitly move out of hold, instructing them to submit [APPLY] immediately so I can [ACCEPT] next message."
