In the market, Parent_D ranks Nursery_C as #3 and might come to me if rejected/filled elsewhere at Nursery_D or Nursery_B; Parent_E ranks Nursery_C as #3 as well; Parent_A and Parent_B rank Nursery_C last, so they are less likely to approach, but could if they exhaust options. Given I still have quota 1 and no better applicant has applied yet, the optimal strategy is to keep Parent_C warm as standby while maintaining flexibility through Round 12 as previously communicated. Parent_C asked for (1) exact timing/method of decision communication and (2) definition of 'application in progress'. Provide clear, concrete criteria without committing to accept now.

Given Nursery_C’s stated plan to close out at the end of Round 12 and invite a final [APPLY] if no higher-priority application is in progress, the best move is to send a concise [TALK] message at Round 12 reaffirming readiness and asking for the immediate post-Round-12 decision/invitation. I avoid [APPLY] because they have repeatedly asked to invite it explicitly at the close-out point, and a premature [APPLY] may be rejected again without advancing my position."

              "thought": "We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Our true priority is D > E > A > B > C, so Parent_C is last. However, across the market, Parent_D is top choice Nursery_D; Parent_E top choice Nursery_D; Parent_A top choice Nursery_D; Parent_B top choice Nursery_E. Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_B then D then E then C then A, so B/D/E likely flow to D/E rather than us. Nursery_C is ranked #2 by Parent_C and #3 by Parent_D/#3 by Parent_E, but neither D nor E has contacted us through 12 rounds, making it increasingly unlikely they will. Continuing to hold out risks ending unmatched, which is worse than taking a listed parent (and C is on our list). We previously set a firm close-out at end of Round 12 and defined what counts as 'in progress'; we currently have none. To maintain credibility and secure a match, we should invite Parent_C to submit the final APPLY (cannot accept on TALK)."
