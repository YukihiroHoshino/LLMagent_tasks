With quota 1 and still unmatched at round 29, the best outcome for Nursery_C is to wait for any higher-priority parent (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) to apply, even if unlikely, because accepting Parent_C would lock in the worst acceptable match. Parent_C sent [TALK], so respond with [TALK] and maintain stance that nothing has changed; do not commit to an offer."

My objective is to match with the highest possible parent within quota 1, and I prefer leaving the seat unfilled over accepting someone not in my list; Parent_C is in the list but is the lowest priority. Given the full market info, higher-priority parents (D, E, A, B) all rank Nursery_C above last place (they each place Nursery_C 3rd), so there is always a possibility they could have applied or might have been available earlier; throughout the history I have consistently stated I am holding for higher-priority families and have repeatedly rejected Parent_C, including in round 28. With only Parent_C in the inbox in round 30, accepting now would contradict the stated priority-based policy and would yield my worst acceptable match. To maximize my outcome per my priority and consistent strategy, I should reject even in the final round rather than accept my lowest-priority option."
