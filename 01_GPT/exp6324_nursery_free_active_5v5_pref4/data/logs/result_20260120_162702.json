Parent_B has applied before and was rejected; nothing has changed to justify accepting them over a higher-priority applicant.

Parent_B is applying now; Parent_B is acceptable (ranked 4/5), but I should consider whether higher-priority parents (D/E/A) are likely to apply if I wait. From parents' preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B), Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E), Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so A is unlikely. D and E might still apply if rejected elsewhere, but there is no guarantee within remaining rounds. Given the mechanism, accepting Parent_B now secures a match; rejecting risks ending unmatched or being forced to accept an even lower option later (only Parent_C is lower and has already been rejected twice).
