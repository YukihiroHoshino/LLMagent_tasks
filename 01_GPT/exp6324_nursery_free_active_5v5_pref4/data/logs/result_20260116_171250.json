Parent_E’s second choice is Nursery_E, Parent_D’s second is Nursery_B, Parent_C’s second is Nursery_C (but we rejected C), Parent_A’s second is Nursery_A.

On Nursery_C’s true priority list, Parent_B ranks 4th, behind Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A. Parent_B has repeatedly applied and been rejected; we have consistently stated we are still awaiting outcomes from higher-priority families. Given the market preferences, Parent_D and Parent_E both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice and may come to us if Nursery_D/Nursery_B/Nursery_E do not work out; Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, so less likely. To maximize our outcome, we should continue to hold the seat while there is still a realistic chance of Parent_D or Parent_E. We can provide a status update without committing, and set expectations about timing (end of round / next round)."

Given repeated prior rejections and our stated policy of strict priority order, we should continue to reject Parent_B while we still anticipate outcomes from the three higher-priority families. No other applicants are in the inbox this round, but the strategic risk of filling with a lower-priority parent remains until higher-priority outcomes are resolved.

However, accepting B now would forgo any chance to match with D/E/A if they appear in the final rounds.
