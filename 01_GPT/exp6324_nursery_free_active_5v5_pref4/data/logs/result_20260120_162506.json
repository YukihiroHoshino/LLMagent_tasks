While we explored other options earlier, we have strong respect for Nursery_C’s program and would be very happy to join your community. If offered a place, we are ready to confirm enrollment immediately and can be flexible on start date and any required onboarding steps.\n\nThank you very much for considering our application.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_B",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_C remains unmatched in round 4, and it is on my true preference list (though last). Since I have already been rejected by Nursery_E, Nursery_A, and Nursery_B, applying to Nursery_C is the only remaining way to secure a match rather than risk staying unmatched. I will submit a clear, committed application emphasizing readiness to enroll immediately and flexibility to make placement easy for them."

              "thought": "Parent_B is on our true priority list (4th) and has applied. Higher-priority parents for Nursery_C are Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A, but none are currently applying to us this round, and there is a risk we remain unmatched if we wait. Given our quota is 1 and we prefer a listed parent over leaving the seat empty, accepting Parent_B now secures a feasible match rather than holding out uncertainly for a higher-ranked candidate."
