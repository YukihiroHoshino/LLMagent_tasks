              "thought": "Nursery_B quota is 1 and currently unfilled. Our true priority order is D > A > B > C > E, so Parent_B is acceptable but not top. However, Parent_D and Parent_A both rank Nursery_B highly (2nd and 3rd respectively) but each has Nursery_D as their first choice; Nursery_D’s priorities are B > D > E > C > A, so D is also highly likely to be taken by Nursery_D, reducing chances D comes to us. Parent_A is low priority at Nursery_D and might later come to us, but there is no current signal from A or D. Waiting risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply. Given repeated applications from Parent_B and their readiness to accept immediately, accepting now secures a match with a mid-high priority parent rather than gambling on uncertain future applications."
