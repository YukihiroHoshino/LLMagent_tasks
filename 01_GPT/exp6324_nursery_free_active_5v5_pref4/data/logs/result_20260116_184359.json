In contrast, Nursery_B ranks me #1, so if I apply there now I am very likely to secure an immediate match at my #2 choice rather than gamble on Nursery_D and potentially fall further. Therefore I will apply to Nursery_B to lock in a strong outcome."

Given the market, Parent_A ranks us 4th, Parent_D ranks us 5th, Parent_E ranks us 2nd, and Parent_C ranks us 3rd. Nursery_D is the top choice for most parents and may absorb many applications; however, higher-priority candidates for us (Parent_A/Parent_D/Parent_E) could still come to us in later rounds if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Parent_B now would lock our only seat and prevent matching with higher-priority parents. With no immediate competing offers in our inbox besides Parent_B, the best strategy to maximize our outcome is to reject now and keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates."
