There is a risk that Parent_D or Parent_E may still approach Nursery_C in later rounds if rejected elsewhere, but accepting Parent_B now would fill my only quota and prevent matching with a higher-priority parent. Given we are only at round 5 of 30, it is strategically better to keep the seat open and wait for a higher-ranked parent rather than lock in Parent_B."
