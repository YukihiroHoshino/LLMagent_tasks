Given uncertainty about receiving Parent_A/Parent_D applications and the cost of leaving the seat empty, it is optimal to accept Parent_E now (a relatively high-priority candidate) rather than risk ending unmatched."

Since quota is 1 and accepting A now would lock us in, we should consider whether higher-priority parents (E/C/D) might apply later. Check parents’ preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, so unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere. Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—both may come later if they fail at top choices, but there is uncertainty. Given we are at round 2 and still have time, rejecting A risks ending unmatched if C/D never come; however, A is still preferable to leaving spot empty and is in our list. Also, A appears to value us highly and can commit immediately, reducing risk. Therefore accept Parent_A now to secure a decent match rather than gamble for C/D."
