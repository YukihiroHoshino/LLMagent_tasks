I should avoid filling my only seat with a low-priority parent if there is a realistic chance of getting Parent_B later. Parent_B’s preferences rank Nursery_D 4th (behind E, A, B), so Parent_B is unlikely to apply to me in early rounds and may never reach me unless rejected elsewhere. Meanwhile, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice and has applied now; Parent_D is my 2nd-highest priority overall and higher than E/C/A.
