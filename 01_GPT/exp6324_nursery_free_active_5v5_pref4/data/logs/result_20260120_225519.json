However, higher-priority parents D and E both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice and may still be unmatched if they fail to secure Nursery_D/B/E. Accepting B now would forgo any chance to match with D/E if they later apply, which would be worse for our objective. With no deadline forcing immediate fill and round 13 still within the expected window (13–14) to finalize, we should continue holding and reject B’s application for now to preserve priority order."

Parent_C previously applied and was rejected; Parent_A, Parent_D, Parent_E have not applied to Nursery_C and each ranks Nursery_C low/moderate: A has C last; D has C 3rd; E has C 3rd; C has C 2nd but was already rejected. Given we are at the stated decision window (rounds 13–14) and continued holding risks ending unmatched. Accepting Parent_B now secures a match; higher-priority parents are unlikely to come to Nursery_C given their preferences, and no higher-priority applications are present this round.
