However, Parent_A (my top choice) has Nursery_E as 4th choice and may come later if rejected by D/A/B; Parent_D has Nursery_E as last choice and is unlikely to apply unless rejected everywhere else. If I accept Parent_E now, I fill my only quota and lose any chance to match with Parent_A. Given Parent_E’s strong willingness to enroll immediately and that waiting carries risk (I could end unmatched), I must weigh expected likelihood: Parent_A likely gets accepted by Nursery_D? Nursery_D’s top priority is Parent_B, then D, E, C, A; so Parent_A is last at Nursery_D and may be rejected there. Parent_A’s next is Nursery_A, where A ranks Parent_A 4th; could be rejected depending on competition. So Parent_A might eventually apply to me. Still, there is no guarantee Parent_A will reach me, and rejecting Parent_E now could leave me with only lower-ranked options later. Parent_E is relatively high on my list and is applying now; accept to secure a good match rather than gamble for Parent_A."
