Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 2nd, making them a relatively reliable applicant. Still, since round is only 2/30 and we can wait without penalty, the optimal strategy to maximize chance of matching higher on our list is to reject Parent_E now and keep the seat open for potential Parent_A/Parent_D later. Parent_E can pursue Nursery_D first (their top choice) and may still be available later if not matched, but we cannot hold them with TALK because their message is [APPLY] and we must decide accept/reject.
