Meanwhile, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D 1st and is ready to confirm, making acceptance highly likely and immediate. Although Parent_E is ranked below D (3rd) and Parent_C/A even lower, holding out for Parent_B is risky given the one-shot-per-round communication and potential for other nurseries to lock in Parent_B quickly.

Looking at parents' preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—so it is unlikely (though not impossible) that E/C/D will apply soon, since they all prefer Nursery_D and others above me.
