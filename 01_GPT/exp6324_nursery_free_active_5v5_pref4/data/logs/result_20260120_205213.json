Parent_B continues to apply, but we should keep the seat open in case Parent_D/Parent_E/Parent_A engage later. Given the process is only at round 14 (out of 30), there is still meaningful chance a higher-priority parent could apply (e.g., if rejected elsewhere). Therefore we reject Parent_B again to preserve the option value of matching higher on our priority list. Provide helpful info about documents without committing."

No higher-priority parents (D/E/A) have applied to Nursery_C so far; Parent_C applied earlier and was rejected, and Parent_B has repeatedly applied. From parents’ preferences: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd, Parent_E ranks it 3rd, Parent_A ranks it last—so D or E could still plausibly come later, but after 16 rounds with no contact, the likelihood is diminishing. However, the objective is to match as high as possible on our priority list within quota, and we prefer leaving unfilled over accepting outside the list; Parent_B is on the list, but accepting now would forgo any chance of matching with D/E/A if they apply in later rounds. With many rounds remaining (up to 30), and given our stated policy of holding for higher-priority families, we continue to reject Parent_B this round to preserve the option value of a higher-priority match."

Parent_B’s preferences place Nursery_C last, so they likely apply only because other options are exhausted; still, accepting them now secures a match rather than risking ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply.
