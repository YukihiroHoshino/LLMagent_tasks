Please reply to confirm acceptance, and we will send the enrollment steps and required documents immediately.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Parent_C is last on our true priority list. In Round 30 (final round), only Parent_C has applied to us; no higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) are engaging with Nursery_C in this round. However, our stated policy is that we prefer leaving the position unfilled rather than accepting a parent not included in our list, and while Parent_C is included, they are the lowest priority. Still, with no competing applicants and no remaining rounds to wait for higher-priority families, accepting Parent_C yields a filled seat with an eligible parent rather than ending unmatched. Given quota=1 and final round, accept."
