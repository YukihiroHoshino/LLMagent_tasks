If no higher-priority family finalizes and the place becomes available to my priority level, I can confirm immediately and fully commit to enrolling at Nursery_C. I’m flexible on start date (including immediate start) and can complete any required documentation the same day.\n\nThank you for keeping me noted as ready-to-confirm.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_B",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_C remains unmatched and it is on my true preference list (last choice but acceptable vs. being unmatched). Given repeated rejections due to priority order, the best move is to keep submitting a clear, ready-to-confirm application each round, emphasizing immediate commitment and flexibility so they can finalize quickly if no higher-priority family applies."

              "thought": "Nursery_C priority order is D > E > A > B > C. We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched. Only Parent_B applied this round. Accepting B now would lock us in with a lower-priority parent than D/E/A, but after 19 rounds none of D/E/A have approached Nursery_C; B has repeatedly applied and is ready to commit immediately. Waiting longer risks ending unmatched by round 30 with no guarantee higher-priority parents will apply. Given the late stage and persistent lack of higher-priority interest, accepting Parent_B maximizes certainty of filling the seat while still staying within the acceptable priority list."
