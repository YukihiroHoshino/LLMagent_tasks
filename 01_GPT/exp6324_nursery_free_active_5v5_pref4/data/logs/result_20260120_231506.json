Current inbox has Parent_B and Parent_C applying; B is ranked above C, so if choosing among current applicants, B dominates C. However, we prefer to match as high as possible, and higher-priority parents (D, E, A) have not yet applied to us. Looking at parents’ preferences: D ranks us 3rd (after D and B) so may apply later if rejected elsewhere; E ranks us 3rd (after D and E) and could also come later; A and B both rank us last, so B applying now suggests they are being rejected elsewhere and may still accept. Given the round is only 4/30, it may be worth holding out for D or E, but there is risk we end unmatched if we reject B and no higher-priority parent applies to us. Since B is acceptable (on our list) and better than C, and an acceptance finalizes the match, the safer strategy to secure a decent match now is to accept B rather than gamble for D/E/A."
