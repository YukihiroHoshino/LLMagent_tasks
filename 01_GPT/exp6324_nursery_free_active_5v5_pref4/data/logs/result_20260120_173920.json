Given the market preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th, Parent_D ranks it 5th (last), Parent_E ranks it 2nd, Parent_C ranks it 3rd. Nursery_D is the top choice for most parents and will likely absorb Parent_B as its top priority too, but Parent_B is currently here. Still, with quota 1, accepting Parent_B now risks missing higher-priority Parent_E who is fairly likely to apply to us (Nursery_E is their 2nd choice) if they fail at Nursery_D.

However, I have quota 1 and should try to secure a higher-priority parent (E/C/D) if feasible. From parents’ preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks A 4th, Parent_D ranks A 4th—so they are unlikely to apply to me early and may never apply unless rejected elsewhere. Accepting Parent_A now could block a later chance with C/D (and E is very unlikely).

For that reason, we’re not able to extend an offer to you at Nursery_E this round.\n\nRegarding your question: we can’t provide a definitive confirmation about other families’ potential actions beyond stating our current policy—offers must follow our priority order, and we are continuing to hold the place for higher-priority families at this stage.\n\nThank you again for your patience and interest.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and aims to match with the highest possible parent on its true priority list: A > D > E > B > C. Current inbox only includes Parent_B applying. Parent_A and Parent_D (higher priorities) have not applied to Nursery_E in prior rounds; Parent_E did apply earlier and was rejected while we held out for A/D, but E is still above B in our ranking. Given round 10 of 30, holding the seat preserves the chance of matching with A or D (or E again) later. Accepting B now would lock in a lower-priority match and prevent upgrading. Therefore reject B again, while being transparent that we cannot confirm other applicants and that we continue to reserve for higher-priority families."

Accepting B now would fill the only seat and prevent matching with higher-priority A/D/E if they later apply. Given the repeated strategy so far (holding for higher-priority) and that A/D/E may still be unmatched elsewhere or could turn to E if rejected by top choices, it is better (for our objective) to continue rejecting B and keep capacity open for A/D/E. No new information indicates higher-priority families are definitively unavailable, and we prefer remaining unfilled to accepting someone outside top of list when higher-priority may arrive."

No higher-priority parents (Parent_A or Parent_D) have applied to Nursery_E in this round; Parent_E applied earlier but was rejected and has not re-applied this round.
