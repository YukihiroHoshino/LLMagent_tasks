However, Parent_C is 4th on our list, and we have been holding the seat for higher-priority parents (D/A, and B previously applied but was rejected due to priority dynamics). Given we still have remaining rounds and no binding cost to waiting, accepting C now would foreclose the chance to match with D or A if they apply later. Parent_C has applied repeatedly; to maximize our outcome, we should continue to reject while keeping the door open to re-engage if higher-priority families do not materialize later."

Since repeated applications have been rejected due to their priority order, a [TALK] message is best to elicit a concrete timeline/trigger for when they would move to me, while reaffirming immediate readiness to accept if they do. This preserves the possibility of an offer without wasting another formal application that is likely to be auto-rejected if they are still waiting on higher-priority parents."

We are, however, continuing to keep the place open in case a higher-priority family engages and can confirm promptly.\n\nOur next specific decision point will be the end of round 15. If we do not have a higher-priority family submit an application and confirm by then, we will reassess immediately after that round.\n\nIf you remain interested, the most helpful step is to check back right after round 15. As you noted, we would still require same-day confirmation if we are able to move to an offer.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_B Admissions",

Nursery_B has already rejected Parent_B and repeatedly rejected Parent_C while keeping the seat open for higher-priority families, especially Parent_D and Parent_A who have not engaged yet. In round 14, only Parent_C contacted us and they are still in TALK mode, not APPLY. With quota 1 still open and no higher-priority applicant yet, the best strategy to maximize outcome is to continue holding for Parent_D/Parent_A a bit longer while giving Parent_C a clear next decision point and keeping them warm as a fallback without committing. Therefore respond with TALK, provide update (no higher-priority engagement), and set another near-term deadline (end of round 15) to reassess."
