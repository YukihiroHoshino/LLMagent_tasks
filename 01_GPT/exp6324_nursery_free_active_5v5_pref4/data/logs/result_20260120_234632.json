Given Parent_B’s strong interest (Nursery_E is their 1st choice), they are likely to remain available for a short time, while higher-priority parents may first apply to their top choices (often Nursery_D) and could come to Nursery_E later if rejected elsewhere.

What we can confirm is that, if the place remains unfilled once the higher-priority stage is fully concluded, we will contact recorded interested families in line with our allocation priority order to reconfirm immediate availability (calling first, with email as backup) and we would typically request same-day confirmation at that point.\n\nWith thanks,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[TALK]",

We should only accept Parent_C if we expect no chance of matching with any higher-priority parent (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) before the end. Round 29 is near the end, but accepting Parent_C now would foreclose any possibility of a higher-priority match in round 30. Given the repeated prior rejections and stated policy of holding for higher-priority families, and since we still prefer leaving unfilled to taking outside the list (Parent_C is still on the list, but lowest), we should continue to reject to preserve the option for a higher-priority parent to apply next round. History indicates Parent_C will keep applying; we can still accept later only if forced, but the rules require an immediate accept/reject on apply. Optimal is to reject again."
