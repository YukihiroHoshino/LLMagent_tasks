As a result, we still cannot progress to your position or make any commitment at this time.\n\nGiven how late we are in the allocation rounds, please do remain on standby for an urgent same-day call/email. If we are able to move to you, we will contact you immediately and would ask for a confirmation within 1–2 hours, followed by a same-day/next-day quick ID/document check to complete onboarding.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C\n\n[TALK]",

Given we still have quota 1 and it is late (round 28), but there is no indication that higher-priority parents are definitively unavailable; accepting Parent_B now could block a higher-priority match if one arrives in the remaining rounds. Parent_B sent [TALK], so we should continue dialogue, keep them warm as a standby, and avoid committing while preserving the option to offer later if higher-priority candidates do not materialize."

We have repeatedly rejected/held off because higher-priority families (D/E/A) could still approach us. However, we are at round 29 (near the end). If we reject again and no higher-priority parent applies in round 30, we risk ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with Parent_B (who is on our list and highly committed/ready to start). Parent_D/E/A all rank Nursery_C mid-to-high (D ranks C 3rd; E ranks C 3rd; A ranks C last), but none have applied so far; continued waiting has not produced them. Given the late stage and Parent_B’s immediate acceptance, accepting now maximizes expected outcome versus the high risk of remaining unfilled."
