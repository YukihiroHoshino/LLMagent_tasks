Parent_B’s preferences rank Nursery_D 4th, so they are unlikely to apply early and may match elsewhere (especially Nursery_E or Nursery_A) before coming to me. If I reject Parent_D now to wait for B, I risk ending up with a lower-priority match (E/C/A) or potentially no match.

However, Parent_E (our top) and Parent_C/D (also above A) have not applied yet. Given parents’ preferences, Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks it 4th, Parent_D ranks it 4th—so it’s plausible none of E/C/D will apply to us. Still, Parent_A is likely to get accepted by Nursery_D (their top) if they apply there, since Nursery_D’s priority places A last, so maybe not; Nursery_D may accept others first. But delaying could risk ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never come. With only round 2 and quota 1, a cautious approach is to reject now to keep the seat open for higher-priority candidates, but that risks losing A. Since A is in our acceptable list and is better than B, and there’s no evidence higher-priority candidates are coming, accept A to secure a match."
