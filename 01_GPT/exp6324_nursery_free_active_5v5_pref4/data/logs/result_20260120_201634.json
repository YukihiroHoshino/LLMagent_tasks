With quota 1 and round 30 (final), no other parents are in the inbox, but accepting Parent_C would still result in the lowest-priority match. Given the stated rule that we prefer leaving the position unfilled rather than accepting someone not included (and Parent_C is included but least-preferred), the key question is whether any higher-priority parents (D, E, A, B) could still be obtained now. In this protocol, we can only match via an [APPLY] received; none of the higher-priority parents applied to us in the final round, and we have no mechanism to initiate or force an application. Therefore, the probability of matching with a higher-priority parent is effectively zero at round 30. To maximize outcome within constraints, we either accept Parent_C now or end unmatched. Since Parent_C is on the true list, accepting yields a better outcome than being unfilled."
