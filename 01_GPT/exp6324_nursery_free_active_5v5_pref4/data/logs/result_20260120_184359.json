However, my top choices are Parent_A and Parent_D (and then Parent_E). Parent_A ranks Nursery_E 4th and Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last, so they are unlikely to apply soon; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 2nd and could still come if rejected elsewhere, but there is no guarantee. Since I have quota 1 and remain unmatched at round 5, accepting Parent_B now secures a match with a mid-priority candidate and prevents ending up with only Parent_C later.
