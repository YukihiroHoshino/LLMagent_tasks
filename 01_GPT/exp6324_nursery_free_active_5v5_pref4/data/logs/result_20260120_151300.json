Even though it is round 29 and only Parent_C is contacting us, we still prefer leaving the seat unfilled to accepting someone outside/at the bottom of our priority, and we have consistently held the seat for higher-priority families. With quota 1, accepting Parent_C would block any potential late application from a higher-priority parent in round 30. Therefore, reject again while reiterating policy and that we would only move if higher-priority families do not take the seat."

I have all requested items prepared (ID/contact details, medical/allergy & immunisation records, emergency contacts/authorised pick-up list, preferred start date and settling-in availability) and we are ready to pay any standard deposit/fees promptly upon offer.\n\nI understand you must follow your priority order. If you determine that none of the higher-priority families will take the place, I would be very grateful for a prompt same-round decision on this application.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_C",

              "thought": "Nursery_C’s true priority list is [Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C], so Parent_C is the lowest-ranked acceptable parent. Across the entire 30-round history, none of the higher-priority parents (D/E/A/B) has ever contacted Nursery_C, and in round 30 the only inbound message is Parent_C’s [APPLY]. Since this is the final round, there is no future opportunity to wait for a higher-priority applicant; rejecting would leave the seat unfilled. Parent_C is on our acceptable list, so accepting now maximizes our outcome given the end of the process and the absence of higher-priority applicants."
