However, Nursery_D is the top choice for most parents (A, C, D, E), so Parent_E will likely be competing there; Nursery_D prioritizes B > D > E > C > A, so Parent_E is only 3rd at D and may be displaced by B or D. My best outcome is to match with Parent_A or Parent_D, but neither has approached me and both have strong incentives to pursue Nursery_D first; Parent_D also least-preferred me, making them unlikely to apply soon. Given round 2 and the risk of ending unmatched if I wait for unlikely higher-priority applicants, accepting Parent_E (a relatively high-priority candidate who credibly commits) is a good strategic choice to secure a match within quota."

Ideally we would match with D/E/A, but none have applied to Nursery_C across the history; Parent_B has repeatedly applied and is ready to confirm immediately. At round 13 (post round-12 reassessment), continuing to hold risks ending unmatched. Accepting Parent_B now secures a match within quota 1 and is consistent with our stated timeline to move to the next available family after round 12."
