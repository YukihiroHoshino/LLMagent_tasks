Parent_D ranks Nursery_D as their 1st choice and is ready to confirm, so accepting them now secures a very high-priority match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked parent later.

Current inbox only has Parent_B, but higher-priority parents (especially Parent_D and Parent_E) may still be unmatched and could apply later; Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd and Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd, so they might come if rejected elsewhere. Accepting Parent_B now would block any later higher-priority match. Since Parent_B is only talking (not applying) and we still have quota 1, best response is to continue dialogue, provide a clear deadline, and invite an immediate apply at that deadline if no higher-priority application is active. Provide concrete round-based commitment to maintain credibility while keeping option value."

Parent_B ranks Nursery_C last, but has shown strong willingness to commit immediately and has been persistently engaged. We already stated we will stop holding at end of Round 14 and asked for a fresh APPLY at start of Round 15. In this round, Parent_B is only TALK; we should keep them warm, clarify we cannot provide an exact market timestamp, and instruct them to send APPLY immediately at the start of Round 15 with minimal wording. This preserves option value for any late higher-priority applicant while maintaining Parent_B as a backup."
