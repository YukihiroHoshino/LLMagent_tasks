Accepting Parent_E now would lock in a lower-ranked match (#3) and foreclose the higher-priority Parent_D. Since I can only respond to Parent_E here, I should reject to preserve the seat for Parent_D.

No higher-priority applicants (D/E/A) are currently applying, so we should keep the seat available to potentially accept B now (or wait for D/E/A later). Since we must respond to Parent_C’s [APPLY] with accept/reject, and accepting C would block a better-ranked B (and any future higher-ranked applicants), we should reject C again while leaving door open if the place remains unfilled after higher-priority applicants are processed."

In the current inbox, applicants are Parent_C and Parent_B; B is ranked higher than C, so if choosing among current applicants, accept B. However, higher-priority parents (D, E, A) may still be unmatched and could apply in later rounds; accepting B now would foreclose that possibility. Still, given Parent_B is applying now and is above Parent_C, and there is no guarantee higher-priority parents will apply to Nursery_C (they all rank Nursery_D or others above C), it is reasonable to secure a match with B rather than risk ending unfilled. Therefore, accept Parent_B."
