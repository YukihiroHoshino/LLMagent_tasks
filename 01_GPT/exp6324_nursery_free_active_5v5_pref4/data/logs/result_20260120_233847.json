Since Parent_B ranks Nursery_D 4th (after E, A, B), they may not apply to me early, but could later if rejected elsewhere. Meanwhile, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D 1st and is applying now, so accepting D yields a high-priority, highly committed match (2nd on my list) and reduces risk of ending with a lower-ranked parent.
