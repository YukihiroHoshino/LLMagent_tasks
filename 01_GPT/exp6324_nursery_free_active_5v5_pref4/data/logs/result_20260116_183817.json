              "message": "Dear Parent_C,\n\nThank you for submitting your fresh application at the start of round 12 as requested, and for confirming you can accept immediately and are flexible on start date.\n\nAs we have not received an application from any higher-priority family by this decision point, we are able to offer you the remaining place at Nursery_B. Please reply to confirm acceptance, and we will proceed with enrollment paperwork and agree the exact start date (immediate start is possible, or another upcoming date you prefer).\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_B",
              "thought": "Nursery_B priority order is D > A > B > C > E. Only Parent_C has applied this round; Parent_B previously applied twice and was rejected, and no higher-priority parents (D/A/B) have contacted us by round 12 as we anticipated. With quota 1 and no other active candidates, holding longer risks ending unmatched; accepting Parent_C now yields a match with a mid-priority acceptable parent (rank 4/5) rather than potentially remaining unfilled. Parent_C has shown strong commitment and immediate acceptance/flexibility, reducing execution risk."
