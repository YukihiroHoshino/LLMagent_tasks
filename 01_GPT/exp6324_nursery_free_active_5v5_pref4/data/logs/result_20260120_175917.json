              "thought": "Nursery_C priority order is D > E > A > B > C. Parent_B is acceptable but lower than D/E/A. Parent_B is repeatedly applying; no other applicants this round. However, higher-priority parents (especially Parent_D and Parent_E) both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice and could plausibly apply later if rejected elsewhere. With round 22/30, there is still time to wait for a higher-priority applicant; accepting B now would foreclose that possibility given quota 1. Therefore reject again to preserve option value for higher-priority parents, consistent with prior stance."

Parent_B is 4th, and we have already rejected Parent_C (5th) and Parent_B multiple times to keep the seat available for higher-priority parents. Check likelihood of higher-priority applicants: Parent_D ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and B) and Parent_E ranks Nursery_C 3rd (after D and E), so either could still apply if not yet matched. Parent_A ranks Nursery_C last, but could apply late if unmatched. With round 23/30, there is still time for higher-priority families to reach us; accepting Parent_B now would forfeit any chance to match with D/E/A, which is against our objective.

However, by round 24 no higher-priority parent (D/E/A) has applied to Nursery_C, and Parent_C (lower than B) already applied and was rejected. Given parents’ preferences: D prefers D then B then C; E prefers D/E then C; A and B rank C last; C ranks C second. It is still possible D or E could apply later, but with only 6 rounds left and ongoing absence of higher-priority applications, the expected benefit of holding the seat further is diminishing. To avoid ending unmatched (which is worse than matching with an acceptable parent on our list), accept Parent_B now."
