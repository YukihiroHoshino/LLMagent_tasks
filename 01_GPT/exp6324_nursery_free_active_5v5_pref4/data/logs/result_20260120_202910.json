Thank you again for marking our file as “ready to finalize.”\n\nSince we are now in round 14, I just wanted to confirm that the timeline is unchanged (still holding through round 15, with the earliest possible move to the next families at the start of round 16). If that remains the case, I will send a formal [APPLY] at round 15 (and again first thing round 16 if needed) so we can finalize immediately.\n\nIf anything changes before then (e.g., you begin moving down the list earlier), please let me know and I can submit an [APPLY] right away and return the form + payment within the hour.\n\nThank you.",

Nursery_B has explicitly said they are still holding for higher-priority families through round 15 and that the fastest path is to send an [APPLY] at round 15/16. Since we are in round 14, I should not waste an apply that will be auto-rejected; instead I will send a [TALK] message to stay on their radar, confirm I will apply at round 15, and ask for a quick confirmation that their timeline/holding status is unchanged and that they will be ready to send the form immediately if they move down the list."

              "thought": "Parent_B is 3rd on Nursery_B’s true priority list (after Parent_D and Parent_A). Nursery_B has quota 1 and is currently unmatched. In round 15, only Parent_B applied. However, Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their 2nd choice and Parent_A ranks Nursery_B as their 3rd choice; both could still approach Nursery_B in later rounds if rejected elsewhere (notably many parents rank Nursery_D highly, which may create rejections and subsequent applications to Nursery_B). Accepting Parent_B now would lock in a lower-priority match and eliminate the chance to match with Parent_D or Parent_A. Since we prefer higher-priority families and have been explicitly holding through round 15, optimal strategy is to reject in round 15 and reassess in round 16+ if no higher-priority applicants appear; if none do by round 16/17, then consider accepting Parent_B to avoid remaining empty. For now, maintain consistency with stated policy and reject this round while inviting re-apply at round 16."
