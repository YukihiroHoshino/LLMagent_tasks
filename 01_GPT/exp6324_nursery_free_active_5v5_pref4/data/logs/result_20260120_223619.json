If offered the place under your admissions priority order, I can accept immediately and complete all enrollment steps within 24 hours.\n\nIf you are now at the stage of being able to offer the place to the next eligible family, I would be very grateful to be considered as soon as I become eligible. You have my contact details on file (parent_c@email.example; +44 7700 900123, reachable 7am–9pm), and I can respond the same day.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_C",

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and true priority list ranks Parent_C last. Higher-priority parents are Parent_A, Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_B. Parent_B and Parent_E already applied and were rejected earlier, but rejecting them did not create a match; Parent_A and Parent_D have not applied. Parent_C has repeatedly applied and been rejected; accepting now would lock in the lowest-priority option and prevent a potential late application from Parent_A or Parent_D in the final round. Since the simulation is at Round 29 with one round remaining, the optimal strategy to maximize expected match quality is to continue holding the seat for a chance at higher-priority applicants, even at risk of ending unmatched, which is preferable to matching with a low-priority parent if higher-priority may still appear. Therefore reject Parent_C again."

In earlier rounds we rejected Parent_B and Parent_E, who are both higher priority than Parent_C, to preserve the option of matching with Parent_A or Parent_D (top priorities). However, it is now Round 30 (final round) and the place remains unfilled; there is no remaining opportunity for higher-priority parents to apply to us. Given the objective to match as high as possible within quota, the best achievable outcome now is to fill the seat with the only applicant in the inbox, Parent_C, rather than end unfilled. Parent_C is on our list (acceptable). Therefore accept."
