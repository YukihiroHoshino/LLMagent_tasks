Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 1st and has reiterated they will accept immediately, making a secure match now. Accepting Parent_B also prevents the risk of ending unmatched or being forced later to choose an even lower-priority option. With quota 1, I should accept the best available applicant now: Parent_B."
