However, accepting Parent_A now would forgo the chance to match with higher-priority Parent_E/Parent_C/Parent_D, who may apply later because Nursery_A is not their top choice (E ranks A last; C ranks A 4th; D ranks A 4th). Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 2nd and is likely to accept quickly, but is lowest on our list.

However, we are still holding the remaining place in line with our priority order, so we’re not able to offer you the spot this round. [REJECT]\n\nWe are now in the reassessment window we discussed. If we reach the next couple of rounds (roughly 23–24) and we still have no viable, confirmable higher-priority application, we will be prepared to move quickly to the next available family, and you are already noted as ready-to-confirm.\n\nBefore then, please confirm one thing: is your latest feasible start date still the start of next month, and are you still able to confirm within 24 hours if we make an offer in the next few rounds?",

However, higher-priority Parent_D ranks Nursery_B as their #2 choice (after Nursery_D) and could still apply; Parent_A ranks Nursery_B #3 and could also apply. No higher-priority applications are currently in hand, but accepting Parent_B now would block a potential match with Parent_D or Parent_A, which is against my objective to match as high as possible on my true priority list. Given we are only at round 22 and previously communicated reassessment around rounds 22–24, I should still hold unless we reach the end of that window without higher-priority interest. Therefore, reject Parent_B this round while reaffirming the reassessment timeline and asking for any updated constraints so I can move quickly if we do offer later."
