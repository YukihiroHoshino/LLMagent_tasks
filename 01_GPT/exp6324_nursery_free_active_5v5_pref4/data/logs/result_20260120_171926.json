Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last, Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, Parent_D ranks Nursery_A 4th—so it is unlikely they will apply to me early, and they may never apply if they secure higher choices. Parent_B ranks Nursery_A 2nd, Parent_A ranks Nursery_A as top remaining choice and is ready to confirm now.
