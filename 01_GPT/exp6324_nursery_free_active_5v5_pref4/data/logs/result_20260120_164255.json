No higher-priority parent (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) is currently applying to us this round, and in their preferences we are their 3rd choice, so they may remain focused on Nursery_D/B/E first and might never reach us. Holding out risks ending unmatched or later only seeing Parent_C again. Accepting Parent_B secures a feasible match with an acceptable candidate on our list."
