Nursery_C has stated the final response window for higher-priority families closes by end of Round 24 and they will start moving down the priority list in Round 25 if still unfilled. In Round 23, applying again is unlikely to succeed and may be counterproductive; a brief [TALK] message is best to (a) confirm the Round 24/25 process is still on track, (b) ensure my application is noted as ready-to-accept immediately, and (c) ask to be contacted the moment they reach my position so there is no delay."
