Seeker_C’s top choice is Company_B, but Company_B prioritizes Seeker_C 3rd and will likely accept Seeker_E first (its top) if Seeker_E applies there; Seeker_E’s top is Company_C, so Seeker_E may not apply to Company_B. Still, Company_B also has Seeker_B as a strong candidate and could fill with Seeker_B, leaving Seeker_C available. Given our quota is 1 and we have a high-ranked candidate (Seeker_C) applying now with stated willingness to commit, it is optimal to accept Seeker_C to secure a strong match rather than risk ending up with a lower-ranked option later."

Has the go/no-go finalized, and have either re-engagement triggers been met (top candidate decline / finalist not progressing)?\n\nIf yes, I can do the 15–20 minute validation screen same-day/next-day and will follow the 3-bullet agenda I shared (reliability/on-call improvements, DRI tradeoffs, scope alignment).\n\nIf no, could you please confirm whether the role will remain open/unfilled this cycle, so I can close the loop on my end? Thank you.",

I have already applied multiple times and they have not reopened formal consideration, but they did define clear triggers for re-engagement. With no further rounds left, the best move is a final, ultra-brief check asking whether a trigger has hit and, if so, requesting the promised validation screen immediately; otherwise, I should ask for explicit closure. Use [TALK] rather than [APPLY] since they repeatedly stated they are not reopening formal consideration unless triggers occur."

Seeker_E has only sent [TALK], not [APPLY], so we cannot accept/reject. Given our repeated prior rejections and stated stance of not reopening formal consideration unless triggers hit, and no evidence those triggers have been met, the consistent move is to close the loop: confirm we’re not moving forward this cycle and that the role will be treated as closed for this matching cycle (or unfilled)."
