However, in this round we also received an [APPLY] from Seeker_E (ranked #4) who lists Company_C as their top choice, while Seeker_C lists Company_C as #2 behind Company_B. The top choice for Company_C is Seeker_B, who is likely to apply elsewhere first (Seeker_B prefers Company_A then Company_B then Company_C), so there is some chance Seeker_B becomes available later. Given quota=1, accepting Seeker_C now could block a potential higher-priority Seeker_B later. But rejecting Seeker_C risks losing a highly ranked candidate to Company_B (their #1), and Company_B also ranks Seeker_C relatively high (#3), so Seeker_C may be taken quickly. Seeker_E is lower on our list and can be considered if needed. Best move: accept Seeker_C now to secure a top-2 candidate and avoid ending up with a worse match or vacancy."

Seeker_B prefers Company_A first and may apply to us if rejected there; Seeker_C has Company_B as #1 and may apply soon. Since we have quota 1, accepting D now could block a higher-priority match with B or C in later rounds.
