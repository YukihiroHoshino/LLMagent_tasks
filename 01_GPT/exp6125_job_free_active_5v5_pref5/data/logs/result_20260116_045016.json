While I know you’re likely considering multiple candidates, I’m very motivated to join Company_E and can commit quickly if selected. I’m looking for a role where I can take clear ownership early, execute fast, and deliver measurable results for the team. I’m available to interview immediately and can start promptly. Thank you for considering my application for your single opening. [APPLY]",

Since my top three choices have already rejected/filled, the best move is to apply immediately to Company_E to secure a match rather than risk losing the remaining slot. I will send a concise but strong commitment/impact-focused application and indicate readiness to move fast."

Given our objective to match as high as possible on our priority list, we should reject Seeker_D and preserve capacity for Seeker_A (and potentially Seeker_C/B if they approach later)."
