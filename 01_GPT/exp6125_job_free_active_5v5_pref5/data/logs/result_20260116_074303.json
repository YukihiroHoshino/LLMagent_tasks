These higher-priority seekers may first apply elsewhere, but there is still a reasonable chance they become available if rejected by their top choices.

However, our objective is to match as high as possible on our list; with no other inbound applicants this round, the best play is to reject now to keep the slot open for higher-ranked seekers in upcoming rounds, accepting the risk Seeker_E matches elsewhere."

With quota 1, accepting Seeker_D now would block hiring Seeker_A and reduce our outcome. Additionally, Seeker_D’s preferences place Company_E 4th, so there’s also a higher chance they may prefer other companies if given options. Optimal move is to reject Seeker_D and preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates (especially Seeker_A)."
