Given we prefer higher-ranked candidates and can only hire one, we should reject Seeker_D to preserve the slot for Seeker_A. Market-wise, Seeker_A ranks Company_E 4th but is ready to commit; still, the immediate application plus top priority makes it optimal to hold the role for Seeker_A rather than accept lowest-ranked Seeker_D."
