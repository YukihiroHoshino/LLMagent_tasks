If I accept C now, I fill my only quota and forgo any chance at E or B later. Given the risk that E will never apply to B and B may or may not apply depending on outcomes with Company_A, it is still strategically valuable to keep the slot open at least one more round to try to attract Seeker_B (who has B as #2) and possibly Seeker_E, rather than locking in a lower-ranked match immediately.

Seeker_D is high (2nd) but accepting D now would forfeit the chance to match with E (top). Seeker_E does not rank Company_A first (has Company_C first), so there is some risk E may not accept if we delay; however, the protocol requires us to respond now, and we can only respond to Seeker_D. Given we cannot accept E in this response, the optimal move is to reject D to preserve capacity and pursue/accept E separately. Seeker_D already applied previously and remains interested, but our priority ordering still favors holding out for E."
