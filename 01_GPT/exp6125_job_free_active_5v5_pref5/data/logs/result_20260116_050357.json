Result: +14% conversion on the targeted funnel step and ~9% reduction in support tickets related to the flow within the first month.\n\n2) Built and rolled out an operational dashboard + weekly cadence: I defined the KPI set with stakeholders, implemented data validation, and drove adoption via a recurring review. Result: reduced time-to-detect issues from ~3 days to same-day and improved SLA compliance by 11 percentage points over one quarter.\n\n3) Rapid ramp on an inherited process with unclear ownership: I mapped the workflow, identified bottlenecks, and coordinated changes across teams.

A few relevant examples:\n1) Led a cross-functional feature launch (Product/Eng/Ops): owned scope, milestones, and stakeholder comms; shipped in 6 weeks (2 weeks early). Outcome: +14% conversion on the targeted funnel step and ~9% fewer support tickets in the first month.\n2) Implemented an operational KPI dashboard + weekly review cadence: defined KPIs with stakeholders, ensured data quality, and drove adoption. Outcome: reduced time-to-detect issues from ~3 days to same-day; improved SLA compliance by 11 points over a quarter.\n3) Took over an ambiguous process and stabilized it: mapped workflow, identified bottlenecks, coordinated changes across teams. Outcome: cycle time reduced 10 → 6 days (40%); rework down ~18%.\n\nI can share a 30/60/90 plan tailored to Company_D immediately. What are the next steps and any specific competencies you’d like me to emphasize in the process?",

I will submit a concise, impact-focused application emphasizing ownership, cross-functional execution, and measurable outcomes, and offer to share a 30/60/90 plan."

I previously rejected Seeker_E (#4) to keep capacity for higher-ranked candidates. Although Seeker_D (#1) and Seeker_A (#2) are preferred, neither has contacted me this round, and both rank Company_D last in their preferences, making it unlikely they will apply soon (or at all) unless rejected elsewhere. Seeker_C ranks Company_D 3rd, so they are a realistic and strong match. Given quota=1 and the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for unlikely top candidates, accepting Seeker_C maximizes expected outcome within constraints."
