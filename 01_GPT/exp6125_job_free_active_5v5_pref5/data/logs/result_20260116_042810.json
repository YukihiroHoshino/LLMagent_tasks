Since Seeker_E’s top choices are Company_C then Company_D then Company_A (Company_B is last for them), Company_B is realistically attainable and high on my list.

In this round, I received applications from Seeker_A (#5), Seeker_C (#3), and Seeker_D (#4) as well. Since quota is 1, accepting Seeker_B now secures a very high-priority candidate. Waiting for Seeker_E is risky: Seeker_E ranks Company_B last and is likely to pursue Company_C/D/A first, and Company_A prioritizes Seeker_E #1, making it unlikely Seeker_E matches with us. Seeker_B prefers Company_A over Company_B, so delaying could cause Seeker_B to match elsewhere. Therefore, accept Seeker_B immediately to maximize expected outcome."

Seeker_B’s preferences are A > B > C, so they will likely apply to A first; Company_A’s top priority is Seeker_E, then D, then A, then B—so A may not take B immediately, but B is also desired by Company_B (#2) and Company_C (#1). Still, there’s no guarantee Seeker_B will come to us before we lose Seeker_C.
