In this round we received APPLYs from Seeker_C, Seeker_D, and Seeker_A. Seeker_C is the highest-ranked among current applicants, but accepting now could block a better match if Seeker_E or Seeker_B apply later. Check seeker preferences: Seeker_E ranks Company_B last, so unlikely to apply here; Seeker_B ranks Company_B second but may apply to Company_A first. There is some chance Seeker_B comes later, but not guaranteed. Since we must respond ACCEPT/REJECT (no TALK allowed on APPLY) and we prefer filling with someone on our list (all are), the best expected outcome is to accept Seeker_C now rather than risk ending with lower-ranked or unfilled. Seeker_C also states Company_B is top priority, so acceptance likely locks the match."
