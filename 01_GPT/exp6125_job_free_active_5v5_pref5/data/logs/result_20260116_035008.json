On my true preference list, Company_E is ranked higher than Company_D, and Company_E also ranks me #1 in its priority list, making acceptance very likely if I apply now. Therefore I will apply to Company_E with a clear commitment to accept."

Although Seeker_A ranks Company_E 4th and may have pursued higher choices earlier, the current message signals strong intent now. With quota 1 and an available top-choice applicant in hand, accepting immediately secures the best possible outcome on our priority list and avoids the risk of losing them in later rounds. Seeker_D also applied but is lowest on our list, so we should not hold out or delay for a lower-priority candidate."
