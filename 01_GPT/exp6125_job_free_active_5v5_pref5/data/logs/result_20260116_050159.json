Seeker_C ranks Company_D 3rd and is a stronger target than Seeker_E, but they have higher-preferred companies (B, C) that may accept them. Seeker_E ranks Company_D 2nd, so acceptance would likely lock a stable match now. Given we only have one slot, accepting Seeker_E now risks missing Seeker_C if they later apply; but waiting risks ending unmatched if higher targets never come.
