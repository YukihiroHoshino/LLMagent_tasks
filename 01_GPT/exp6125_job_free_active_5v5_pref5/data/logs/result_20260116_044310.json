Seeker_E ranks Company_B last, so unlikely to apply/accept. Seeker_B ranks Company_A first and Company_B second, so may apply to A first; but A prioritizes E and D above B, so B could be rejected by A and later come to me. Seeker_C ranks Company_B first/second (B is first), so is a strong potential future applicant to me, and I rank C above D.

Here’s what I can share so you can plan.\n\n1) Decision checkpoint timing: our next internal checkpoint is **next round (Round 16)**. That’s when we’ll either (a) have a clear yes/no signal from the higher-priority candidates we’re still pursuing, or (b) decide we don’t have a viable path to closing with them and reopen the slot.\n\n2) Expedited decision if we pivot: **yes**—if we hit that checkpoint without a close and we decide to reopen, we will message you immediately and explicitly prompt a formal **[APPLY]**. If you submit it promptly, we can make an accept/reject decision **within the same round**.\n\nFor this round (Round 15), nothing has changed yet, so there’s no need for you to apply unless/until we send that explicit prompt.\n\n[TALK]",

Our best outcome is still to secure Seeker_D/A/C, but given seekers’ preferences, Seeker_D and Seeker_A rank Company_D last, and Seeker_C ranks us 3rd behind B/C, so likelihood they come to us is low. Still, we’ve been consistently signaling we are holding for higher-priority candidates; changing stance without new info could reduce credibility and prematurely fill with a lower-priority candidate. Since Seeker_E is asking for timeline/decision speed and is cooperative, we should continue TALK, provide a concrete checkpoint (next round) and commit to same-round expedited decision if we pivot, while not prompting APPLY yet."
