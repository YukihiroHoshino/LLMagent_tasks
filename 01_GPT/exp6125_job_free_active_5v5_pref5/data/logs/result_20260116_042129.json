Set plan, stakeholders/RACI, weekly operating cadence, and risk register; drove execution and dependency management across functions.\n- Outcome: delivered the milestone on schedule and established a repeatable operating rhythm that reduced blockers/escalations and improved on-time execution.\n\n2) Second comparable project:\n- Led a 0→1 initiative with multiple stakeholders and tight timelines; aligned requirements, sequenced work, and drove execution through clear metrics and weekly checkpoints.\n- Outcome: hit the target launch/milestone and created dashboards/rituals to keep the workstream on track post-launch.\n\nWhy minimal ramp / fit to your immediate deliverables:\n- Day 1–7: confirm scope + success metrics, map stakeholders/dependencies, set cadence (weekly exec readout + working sessions), and publish an execution plan.\n- Day 8–30: drive the workstream to the first measurable milestone, unblock dependencies, and keep timelines tight via clear ownership and escalation paths.\n- Day 31–60: harden the operating rhythm, track metrics, and push the next milestone(s) with predictable execution.\n\nIf this is still a narrow process, I’m happy to do a very fast screen (15–20 min) focused only on whether my experience matches the exact workstream you’re filling.
