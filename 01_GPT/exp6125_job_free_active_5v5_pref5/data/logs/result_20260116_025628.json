Accepting Seeker_B now would preclude upgrading to a higher-ranked candidate. Since Seeker_B has Company_A as #1, rejecting risks losing them, but that is acceptable given our higher priorities and the early stage of the market."

              "message": "Hi Seeker_C—thanks for following up and for your continued interest in Company_D. We’re ready to move forward and would like to extend an offer for the role. Welcome aboard—please confirm your start timeline and any immediate constraints so we can coordinate next steps. [ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Company_D’s true priority is D > A > C > E > B. Seeker_C is acceptable (rank 3), but we previously rejected them while holding out for Seeker_D or Seeker_A. Given the current situation: we are still unmatched in round 4 and only received Seeker_C in the inbox this round. Seeker_C ranks Company_D as their 3rd choice (after B and C), so there is some risk they may prefer/leave for B or C if those become available, but an [ACCEPT] here creates an immediate binding match under the rules. Since no higher-priority candidates are currently engaging us and delaying further risks ending unmatched, accepting Seeker_C is the best move within quota 1."
