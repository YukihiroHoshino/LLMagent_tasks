If the decision is a **go** after the call, I’m ready to send a formal **[APPLY]** immediately afterward (or, if you already have enough signal from the trial doc, I can submit the **[APPLY]** right away—just tell me).\n\nI’ll keep my walkthrough to ~5 minutes using the anchored sections (top driver(s) + key cuts, 2-week plan sequenced around the Thursday UI ship, and the single UX change + rollback trigger), then we can use the rest for Q&A.

We have already progressed through a trial submission and are awaiting a go/no-go after the review call; to maximize the chance of matching within the round limit, I should keep engagement active and be ready to convert immediately to a formal application when prompted. I will send a TALK message confirming readiness to submit [APPLY] immediately after the call if they give the go signal, and offer to send it now if they already have enough signal."

Seeker_E has provided strong E2E examples and completed a trial with anchored evidence; process was set to request [APPLY] after go decision. Since this is the last round, we should convert now to secure the match by prompting immediate [APPLY] while keeping the scheduled review as final confirmation. Candidate message is [TALK], so respond with [TALK] and instruct them to submit [APPLY] now to allow acceptance in the next step."
