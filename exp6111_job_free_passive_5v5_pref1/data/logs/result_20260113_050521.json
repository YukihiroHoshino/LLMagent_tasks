Here are the specifics, and then a couple quick questions so we can move fast if it’s a fit.\n\n1) Exact role/team + what success looks like\n- Role: generalist, high-ownership contributor on a small cross-functional pod (product + engineering + stakeholders). You’d own a defined problem space end-to-end: clarify the problem, align stakeholders, drive execution, and measure outcomes.\n- Success = (a) you create clarity in ambiguity, (b) you ship/land improvements with measurable impact, and (c) you build a reliable operating cadence with partners (clear priorities, risks surfaced early, decisions documented).\n\n2) Top 2–3 deliverables in the first 60–90 days\n- By ~30 days: deliver a written plan for your problem area (goals/metrics, key bets, milestones, dependencies, and risks) aligned with stakeholders.\n- By ~60 days: ship at least one meaningful deliverable that moves an agreed metric (or hits a concrete milestone if metric movement needs more runway).\n- By ~90 days: own the roadmap for the area with a repeatable execution rhythm (weekly progress, stakeholder updates, and a clear measurement/reporting loop).\n\n3) Decision timeline + what makes an immediate “yes”\n- Timeline: we can run a tight process once you apply—screen → focused loop → decision shortly after. If we’re aligned and your schedule allows, we can compress this.\n- Immediate “yes”: clear examples of (1) driving impact quickly in an ambiguous environment, (2) strong prioritization + stakeholder management, and (3) crisp measurement/definition of success (even when data isn’t perfect).\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor next steps:\n- What kind of impact are you aiming for most (product outcomes, operational/process, technical delivery, customer-facing), and what’s one example where you delivered measurable results in <90 days?\n- What’s your realistic start date, and are you currently in late-stage conversations elsewhere (i.e., do we need to accelerate)?\n\nIf your answers align, I’ll outline the exact interview steps and we can move straight to a formal application and scheduling.",
