We’re conducting initial conversations this week, then a streamlined final round shortly after. If there’s strong mutual fit, we can make a decision and move to offer promptly.\n\nTo tailor this: what type of “immediate impact” work do you do best (e.g., execution/ops, product delivery, analytics, stakeholder leadership), and what would you want your first 90-day win to look like?",

With Company_D (#1) still unmatched but uncertain, I should actively try to convert Company_A now. Companies all share identical priorities (A>B>C>D>E), so I’m lower priority than Seekers A/B/C; however, Company_A is still available in round 8, so top candidates may be pursuing other firms. Best move: strong, concise closing message that reduces friction and asks for a decision/next step this round, offering immediate materials and commitment."

That said, if you send the above today, you’ll be the first person we can move on immediately if the slot opens.\n\nIf you’d like to formalize now, you can also reply with [APPLY] and I’ll respond right away based on where we are.",
