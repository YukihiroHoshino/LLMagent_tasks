Thank you for your consideration.",

I already applied to Company_C; if they reject or delay, Company_B is my best remaining high option. Therefore I should apply now and emphasize readiness and fit to improve acceptance chances."

However, Seeker_E ranks Company_B as 2nd behind Company_A, and Company_A ranks Seeker_E 4th, so Seeker_E may still be attainable but uncertain. Seeker_A is applying now and is a solid acceptable option; rejecting risks ending unmatched or being forced to accept a lower-priority candidate later.
