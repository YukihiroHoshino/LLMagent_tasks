Seeker_E has already applied once and remains highly interested, so accepting them likely secures a match now; waiting risks ending unmatched if Seeker_A matches elsewhere or never applies. Since Seeker_E is on our priority list and we can’t accept unless they apply, we should keep them warm, be transparent we can decide this round, and prompt them to re-apply so we can accept if we choose to lock in."
