If you can, please send (1) your preferred email/phone for the written offer, (2) any timing constraints you’re working with, and (3) 1–2 references (optional but helpful). We’ll also share start-date options and the compensation/details in writing right away.\n\nLooking forward to working together.",

We need someone who can diagnose with data, prioritize the highest-leverage interventions, and drive execution across partners.\n\nProfile that tends to succeed here (skills/traits + collaboration style):\n- Strong analytical decision-making (comfort with metrics, experiments, and ambiguous data)\n- Crisp written communication (decision memos, specs, postmortems)\n- High ownership with pragmatic execution (ships, learns, iterates)\n- Collaborative but decisive: aligns early, then drives to a clear call\n\nIf you want, reply with 3 bullets: (a) a project where you moved a metric (baseline → result), (b) the tools/approach you used, and (c) how you worked cross-functionally. I’ll tell you how directly it maps to this bottleneck and what I’d emphasize if you choose to apply.",
