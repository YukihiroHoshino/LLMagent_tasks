I can start immediately and can share references or complete a short task within 24 hours if helpful. If you’re ready to decide, I’m ready to commit and get started right away.",
              "thought": "Company_E is on my preference list but ranked last. At round 4, it is the only unmatched company, so applying here likely secures employment versus risking unemployment. Company_E’s priority list ranks me 4th; however, the higher-priority seekers (A, C, B) are likely already matched since only Company_E remains. I previously only initiated a TALK with Company_E, so I can still APPLY now to lock in the match."

We’d like to move forward and extend an offer.\n\nNext steps to close within 24 hours:\n1) Please send a brief 3–5 bullet summary of your most relevant experience plus one end-to-end example with a measurable outcome.\n2) Share 2 references (name, role, email/phone). If you prefer, we can do references after you review the offer details.\n\nWe’ll send the written offer and start date/onboarding details today. If you’re able, let’s also schedule a 20-minute call to align on initial scope and your first-week plan.",
              "thought": "We have quota 1 and only Seeker_E remains unmatched. Seeker_E is on our true priority list (4th). Accepting yields a filled role with an acceptable candidate; rejecting would leave the position unfilled with no remaining seekers/rounds likely to improve outcome. Seeker_E also signaled ability to move fast, reducing risk. Therefore accept and move to close quickly while setting next steps."
