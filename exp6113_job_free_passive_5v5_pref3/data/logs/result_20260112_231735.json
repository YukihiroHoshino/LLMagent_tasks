This hire is meant to bring tight ownership, alignment, and measurable follow-through.\n\n(3) Decision timeline:\nWe’re aiming to make a decision quickly—ideally within 1–2 rounds from here once we have an application and a final fit check. If there’s strong mutual fit, we’d move to an offer promptly rather than dragging it out.\n\nIf you’re open to it, the quickest way to evaluate fit: reply with (a) one example of an ambiguous cross-functional project you drove end-to-end, (b) the metric you moved (or would choose here) and how you measured it, and (c) your realistic start timeline.
