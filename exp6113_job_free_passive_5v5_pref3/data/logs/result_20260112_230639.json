We need someone who can structure the problem, identify what data/inputs matter, run lightweight analysis/customer/stakeholder discovery, and produce a crisp recommendation memo that leads to a decision and next steps.\n\n**(2) What would make us confident you’re the right person (signals / work sample)**\n**Key signals we look for:**\n- You’ve **owned ambiguity** before (took a fuzzy goal and created a plan + measurable outcomes).\n- You can **influence without authority** across multiple stakeholders and handle tradeoffs.\n- You communicate with **clarity and concision** (especially in writing: status, risks, decision memos).\n- You have a track record of **shipping** something meaningful within a defined window.\n\n**Work sample (short, practical):**\nIf you’re open to it, we’d ask for a **1–2 page “first 90 days” plan** for one of the problems above (you can make reasonable assumptions). We’d look for: framing, milestones, metrics, stakeholder map/cadence, risks, and what you’d do in weeks 1–2 to de-risk.\n\nIf it’s helpful, please go ahead and **outline your approach to the first 90 days** based on your background (even in bullets).
