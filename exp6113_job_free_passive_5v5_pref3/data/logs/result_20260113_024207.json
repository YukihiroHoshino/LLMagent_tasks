What are the top 1–2 priorities you need this hire to deliver in the first 60 days, and what skills/experience are you weighting most heavily in your selection? Also, what’s your timeline for making a decision?",

I already applied to my #1 (Company_A) and have opened dialogue with Company_C; both are still unmatched, so I should preserve flexibility. Company_E has Seeker_A as its top priority, so I can likely secure it later if my higher choices don’t work out. Therefore, I will [TALK] to keep the option warm without applying yet."

Next step is a **30-min screen** (this week if possible), then **2 interviews** (role deep-dive + cross-functional/values). We typically decide **within ~10–14 days**, often **2–3 business days after the final interview**.\n\nIf you’re open, reply with (a) the role/function you’re targeting, (b) 1–2 recent projects with metrics, and (c) your availability this week for a 30-min screen. If it aligns, I’ll fast-track you into the process.",
