If you can share one example with:\n- the messy starting state,\n- the metric you chose (and why),\n- how you handled stakeholder tradeoffs,\n- and the measurable outcome,\nthat would directly answer what we care about most.\n\nIf that aligns, I’d encourage you to submit the formal application now—once it’s in, we can move quickly to a final-fit conversation and references.",
