However, across many rounds they have not provided the single required concrete example of end-to-end ownership despite repeated requests. It is now round 30 with no further rounds to collect missing info. Accepting without this evidence risks a poor fit; rejecting leaves role unfilled but aligns with stated hiring bar. Since the seeker sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK] and give a clear final decision and reason."
