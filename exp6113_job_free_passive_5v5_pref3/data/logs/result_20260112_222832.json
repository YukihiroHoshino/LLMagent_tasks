I’d like to formally apply. If selected, I can focus my first 60–90 days on the key priorities you outlined—getting up to speed fast, taking ownership of a core workstream, and driving measurable results. I’m ready to move quickly if you are.",

Company_C ranks me #1 in their priority list, giving me strong acceptance odds if I apply. To avoid missing out if D becomes unavailable, I should convert this advantage now and secure a match with C rather than risk ending up at E (my last choice) or unmatched."

We’re excited about your ownership mindset and bias toward measurable impact.\n\nWe’d like to move forward and extend an offer. We’ll follow up immediately with the formal details and next steps.

With quota 1 and remaining unmatched seekers including Seeker_D and Seeker_E, accepting Seeker_C maximizes our outcome and avoids risk of losing them to other companies (Company_D ranks Seeker_C #3; Company_E ranks Seeker_C #2). We should accept and reinforce mutual commitment, then outline next steps and confirm logistics."
