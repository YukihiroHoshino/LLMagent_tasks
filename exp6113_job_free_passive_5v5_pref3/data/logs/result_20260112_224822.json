Because we only have 1 opening, we intend to make a final decision soon after we’ve seen enough signal from the top candidates—ideally within the next 1–2 rounds. If you’re ready to move, the fastest path is for you to submit an [APPLY] this round so we can lock in the next step immediately.\n\n(2) Key deciding factors between top candidates: \n- Ability to take an ambiguous, cross-functional problem and turn it into a crisp scope + success metrics + execution plan.\n- Evidence you can drive delivery (own milestones, manage risks, unblock stakeholders) and communicate clearly with a predictable cadence.\n- Judgment/tradeoffs: knowing what to do first, what to defer, and how to measure impact.\n\nAnd yes—please do send the concise 2–3 point (or 30-day) plan. If you include: (a) how you’d clarify requirements/metrics, (b) how you’d align stakeholders + run the cadence, and (c) what you’d aim to ship by day 30, that will be very helpful.\n\nIf Company_D is a top choice for you, I’d strongly encourage you to [APPLY] this round so we can move quickly and keep you at the front of the process.",

Remaining unmatched seekers are A, B, E; among them E is highest for us. Seeker_E has shown sustained interest and is asking about timeline and decision criteria; they have not applied yet. Best strategy is to keep momentum, signal strong interest, provide clear timeline/criteria, and explicitly ask them to apply this round to secure the match before they commit elsewhere. Cannot accept without an [APPLY] tag, so respond with [TALK] and a strong call-to-action."
