We’d like to move forward with you. \n\nTop priorities for the hire (first 60–90 days):\n1) Ship an early, measurable win end-to-end (clear success metrics, aligned stakeholders, delivered impact).\n2) Establish ownership of a lane with a lightweight operating cadence (weekly metrics/feedback loop) and propose the next 2–3 improvements with rationale.\n3) Communicate crisply and proactively—especially on tradeoffs, risks, and decision points.\n\nIf you reply with a concise 60–90 day plan against those, we’ll use it to structure the working session and can finalize quickly (typically within 3–7 days depending on scheduling).",
