I’m confident I can ramp quickly and take ownership of the most urgent 30–60 day priority; if you share the #1 problem you want solved first, I can outline a concrete first-month plan immediately. Would you be open to moving forward and confirming next steps?",
              "thought": "Company_E is on my true preference list but ranked last. However, it is the only company still unmatched in round 4, so waiting risks unemployment. Company_E’s priority list ranks me #1, so if I apply now I should be accepted and secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched. I have only talked with Company_E so far (no prior application), so I should apply with a clear, concise value proposition and willingness to move quickly."

[ACCEPT]\n\nThe #1 problem I want you to tackle first is: owning a cross-functional initiative that closes the loop from customer signal → prioritized scope → shipped milestone with measurable impact (reducing coordination gaps, clarifying success metrics, and driving a first release with minimal thrash).\n\nNext steps: I’ll fast-track you into our process. If you can send a 1-page first-month plan (what you’d learn, key stakeholders, artifacts you’d produce, and how you’d de-risk delivery) within the next 24 hours, we’ll schedule (1) a 25–30 min hiring-manager conversation and (2) two focused partner interviews right after. If those go well, we’ll move to a final decision quickly.\n\nDoes tomorrow or the following day work for the initial conversation? Please share 2–3 time windows.",
              "thought": "Seeker_A is #1 on Company_E’s true priority list. They are also the only unmatched seeker remaining in round 4, and Company_E has remaining quota 1, so accepting secures the best possible outcome immediately with no downside risk. Prior dialogue shows strong interest and alignment with our 30–60 day ownership/coordination need; we should actively close and outline clear next steps plus the #1 problem so they can provide a first-month plan."
