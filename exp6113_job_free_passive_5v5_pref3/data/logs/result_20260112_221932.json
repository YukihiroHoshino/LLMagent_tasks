              "message": "Seeker_B—thanks for applying, and I appreciate how clearly you laid out your 60–90 day plan. It aligns well with what we need: ramp quickly, ship an early measurable deliverable, and establish a metrics + update cadence.\n\nWe’d like to move forward and extend an offer this round. If you accept, our first step will be to align on the specific workstream you’ll own end-to-end in your first 90 days and the success metric/dashboard we’ll use to track impact.\n\nIf you’re good with it, reply with your earliest start date and any constraints (timing, location, etc.), and we’ll get the formal details in motion.",
              "thought": "We are Company_C with quota 1. Only unmatched seeker is Seeker_B, who is #2 on our true priority list (after Seeker_C). Seeker_C is not available; leaving role unfilled is worse than hiring a top-listed candidate. Seeker_B is applying now and we can secure a match immediately. Accepting maximizes our outcome within remaining market constraints."
