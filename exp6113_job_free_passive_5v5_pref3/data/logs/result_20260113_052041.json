At round 6, Company_E is the only remaining unmatched company, so applying now likely secures employment versus risking unemployment. I have only talked with Company_E so far (no prior application), so [APPLY] is allowed. Company_E’s priority ranks me 4th, but if they are still unmatched, competition may have cleared; a decisive application emphasizing fast impact and willingness to move quickly increases acceptance chances."

We’re aligned on the ramp/structure/early measurable win approach, and we’d like to move forward.\n\nNext, we’ll coordinate a quick kickoff to confirm scope and set you up for success: please share (1) your earliest start date / any timing constraints, and (2) 1–2 specific examples (links or short write-ups) of ambiguous projects you owned end-to-end with metrics/results, plus 1–2 references (name, role, contact) if available.\n\nExcited to have you join and get started.",
