Given quota=1 and no prior matches, accepting now secures a high-priority match and avoids the risk that Seeker_D (who prefers Company_C) or Seeker_E (who prefers Company_C) never become available or accept. Market-wide, Company_C prioritizes Seeker_C highest, so delaying could result in losing Seeker_C to Company_C if they interact. Therefore, accept immediately."

If you can, include: (a) what you’d pick as the initial 6–8 week project, (b) what metrics you’d use to define success, and (c) what you’d do in week 1 to de-risk execution.\n\nOne question to tailor the role to you: which type of work are you optimizing for right now (e.g., execution-heavy ownership, cross-functional leadership, technical depth), and what’s your decision deadline across your other processes?",

Seeker_B ranks us last, so we must actively increase attractiveness and create a clear path to an apply this/next round, while keeping flexibility since they are still exploring. Since they sent [TALK], we respond with [TALK], reiterate 60–90 day outcomes and provide a concrete decision timeline, and explicitly invite a tailored 90-day plan plus propose a quick next step to accelerate to offer."
