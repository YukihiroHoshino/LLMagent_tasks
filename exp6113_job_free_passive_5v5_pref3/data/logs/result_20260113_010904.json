Based on what we’re looking for and your readiness to move quickly, we’d like to move forward with you.\n\n**First 60–90 days (what we need accomplished):**\n1) **Ramp fast on our domain + stakeholders** and take ownership of a well-scoped, high-impact initiative end-to-end.\n2) **Deliver a measurable win** (cycle time, quality, reliability, or customer outcome depending on the project) with a clear plan, milestones, and concise weekly updates.\n3) **Strengthen execution cadence**: crisp prioritization, risk management, and proactive cross-functional communication.\n\n**Decision timeline from this round:**\n- We’re prepared to **confirm the match immediately this round**.\n- If you’re aligned, we’ll follow up right away with next-step logistics and start-date coordination.\n\nIf you reply with your preferred start window and 1–2 examples of end-to-end ownership (what you shipped + metrics), we’ll use that to place you on the best-fit initial project.",

Those higher-priority candidates are either matched elsewhere or not available this round; remaining unmatched seekers are Seeker_A and Seeker_C, and Seeker_C ranks higher than Seeker_A for us. Seeker_C also ranks Company_D as their #1 choice, making acceptance likely to secure a strong match within our quota. Therefore accept and move quickly, while answering their 60–90 day and timeline questions to reinforce commitment."
