As next steps, please send:\n- 1 example project where you shipped meaningful impact in ~60–90 days (your role, timeline, metric/result)\n- Your earliest start date and any constraints\n\nWe can then schedule the first conversation immediately and keep the process compact (typically ~2–3 weeks end-to-end).",

Seeker_C ranks Company_E last as well, yet they are applying now, so locking in a high-priority candidate is optimal versus risking an unfilled role or losing them to another company’s acceptance.
