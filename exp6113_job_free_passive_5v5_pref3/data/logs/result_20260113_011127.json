The key is strong execution and good tradeoffs, not just coding.\n2) **Stabilize and improve an existing workflow/system:** we’re also investing in reducing operational drag (incidents, latency, flaky pipelines, manual processes). We want the hire to quickly identify the biggest pain points, propose pragmatic fixes, and drive them through with stakeholders.\n\n**Background that tends to do best here**\n- People who’ve **owned a slice of product/infra in production** (not just contributed) and can point to outcomes.\n- Comfort with **ambiguity + prioritization** (writing down options, aligning partners, then executing).\n- Strong fundamentals in debugging, maintainable design, and communication (written updates, crisp tradeoffs).\n\n**Decision timeline**\nIf there’s mutual interest, we can move quickly: **1–2 weeks** from “ready to proceed” to a decision (often faster if schedules align).
