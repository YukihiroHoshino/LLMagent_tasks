Below is the “1-page” you asked for, focused on my most technically complex program.\n\n1) Program: Real-time ML ranking + serving reliability/latency initiative\n- Goal: Improve ranking quality while reducing p95 latency and stabilizing production errors for a high-traffic surface.\n- My ownership / decisions (vs Eng):\n  • Defined the end-to-end success metrics + guardrails (offline AUC/precision, online CTR/conversion lift, p95/p99 latency, error rate, feature freshness, and cost per request).\n  • Drove the technical plan from ambiguity: decomposed into (a) data/feature pipeline SLAs, (b) model training cadence + validation gates, (c) online serving architecture + caching/fallbacks, (d) observability + oncall runbooks.\n  • Led design tradeoff discussions with Eng/ML Eng (e.g., feature set vs latency budget, batch vs streaming features, cache strategy, graceful degradation when features stale, rollout strategy with shadow traffic).\n  • Owned rollout governance: experiment design, launch criteria, staged ramp, incident review loop, and weekly exec/stakeholder comms.\n  • Eng owned: writing/landing core service code and infra changes; I owned the cross-team technical direction, requirements, sequencing, and go/no-go criteria.\n\n2) Metrics moved (concrete):\n- Reduced p95 latency ~18% (from ~220ms to ~180ms) via feature pruning + caching + tighter timeouts/fallback.\n- Cut serving error rate ~35% (timeouts + downstream dependency failures) through circuit breakers, better retries, and clearer SLOs.\n- Improved feature freshness SLA from ~92% to ~99% by adding pipeline monitoring + backfill automation.\n- Online experiment showed +1.6% CTR lift (guardrailed for conversion and latency).\n\n3) Stack / systems involved:\n- Data: Kafka (streaming events), Spark (batch backfills), Airflow (orchestration), feature store (online/offline), data quality checks (Great Expectations-style).\n- ML: training pipeline (Python), model registry + versioning, offline evaluation suite, canary/shadow evaluation.\n- Serving: gRPC service in Kubernetes, Redis cache, Prometheus/Grafana dashboards, alerting on SLOs (latency/error/feature freshness), structured logging + tracing.\n\nIf this level of data/ML + production-systems ownership is in the ballpark of what you mean, I’d appreciate a quick signal on whether it’s sufficient to reopen the process. If it’s still not a fit, could you tell me the single missing piece (e.g., model architecture ownership vs program/serving ownership, specific domain like recsys/forecasting, or scale requirements)?",

Answering the sanity-check with two consequential tradeoffs I drove to decision:\n\n1) Streaming vs batch features (freshness/quality vs complexity/latency)\n- Decision I drove: hybrid approach—keep a small set of high-signal, low-latency streaming features online (with strict SLAs), and move the long-tail/heavier joins to batch with a “last-known-good” snapshot for serving.\n- Data/experiments used: (a) feature importance + ablation to quantify marginal lift per feature, (b) end-to-end latency breakdown to see where streaming joins were blowing the budget, (c) backtest on freshness sensitivity (simulate staleness windows) to set minimum freshness SLOs, and (d) an online A/B where we compared hybrid vs streaming-heavy; hybrid preserved most of the lift while materially improving p95/p99 and reducing tail timeouts.\n\n2) Cache/fallback strategy (latency/reliability vs potential quality regression)\n- Decision I drove: introduce a two-tier fallback—(i) short-ttl per-user/item cache for computed features/scores, and (ii) graceful degradation to a simpler model / default feature set when freshness or dependency health checks fail.\n- Data/experiments used: (a) shadow traffic + replay to measure cache hit-rate and quality delta, (b) controlled fault-injection / dependency-disable tests to quantify error-rate reduction and user-impact, and (c) staged ramp with guardrails (CTR/conversion + p95/p99 + error rate) to confirm the fallback only triggered under defined thresholds and didn’t meaningfully hurt core metrics.\n\nIf helpful, I can send a 5–7 bullet “decision log” with the exact numbers/thresholds we used (latency budgets, freshness SLOs, cache TTLs, fallback triggers).

Fallback target: keep p95 < 180ms and error rate < 0.3%.\n6) Ramp plan + stop conditions: staged rollout 1% → 5% → 20% → 50% → 100% with 30–60 min soak per step; auto-halt if CTR drops > 0.5% relative, conversion drops > 0.3% relative, p95 > 210ms, p99 > 380ms, or error rate > 0.8%.\n7) Observability/oncall readiness: SLO alerts on p95/p99, error rate, and freshness; incident severity triggers if p99 > 450ms for 10 min or error rate > 1.5% for 5 min; runbook + dashboard links required before ramping beyond 20%.\n\nBefore/after guardrail outcomes (at 100%):\n- p95 latency ~220ms → ~180ms (~18% improvement)\n- Serving error rate reduced ~35%\n- Feature freshness ~92% → ~99%\n- Online CTR +1.6% (conversion neutral within guardrails)\n\nIf this is sufficient, please confirm whether I can move directly to the first interview stage this week and share the next steps/scheduling window.\n\nThank you,\nSeeker_E",
