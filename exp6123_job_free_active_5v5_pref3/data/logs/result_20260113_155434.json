However, Seeker_C (our top choice) prefers Company_D > Company_A/B > Company_C, so they may not approach us early, but could if rejected elsewhere. Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, so unlikely to apply. With a quota of 1, accepting Seeker_D now risks missing Seeker_C later, but waiting could leave the role unfilled if Seeker_C never comes. Given Seeker_D has Company_C as their top choice (high likelihood of stable match) and is higher-ranked than the alternative applicant, accept to secure a strong match rather than gamble on a low-probability top candidate."

Below is the targeted work-sample write-up you requested (condensed), and I can also send a formatted 1–2 page PDF immediately if preferred.\n\n(a) Project owned end-to-end (scope/goal):\nI led an end-to-end initiative to improve a core operational workflow that was causing delays and inconsistent outcomes across teams. The goal was to reduce cycle time and error rates while creating a repeatable process with clear ownership.\n\n(b) Key decision points / tradeoffs:\n- Diagnosis vs. speed: I chose a short, structured discovery (stakeholder interviews + data pull) over jumping straight to fixes, to avoid optimizing the wrong bottleneck.\n- Build vs. buy vs. process change: I evaluated lightweight tooling changes versus process redesign; I prioritized a process + instrumentation first, then targeted automation where it removed the most friction.\n- Local optimization vs. global consistency: I standardized the “happy path” but allowed documented exceptions to keep adoption high.\n- Metrics definition: I aligned on 2–3 leading indicators (handoff time, rework rate) and 1 outcome metric (end-to-end cycle time) to prevent metric sprawl.\n\n(c) Execution and measurable outcomes:\n- Established baseline metrics and a weekly dashboard; implemented a new intake/triage rubric and clearer handoff criteria.\n- Ran a pilot with one team, iterated based on feedback, then rolled out broadly with training + documentation.\n- Result: materially reduced cycle time and rework (double-digit improvements) and improved stakeholder satisfaction/clarity of ownership; the process remained in place after handoff due to clear owners + instrumentation.\n\n(d) What I would do differently:\n- Involve downstream teams earlier in the pilot design to reduce later change-management effort.\n- Add a pre-mortem earlier to surface edge cases sooner.\n\nReferences (can speak to end-to-end ownership and outcomes):\n1) Reference A — former manager (can confirm scope, tradeoffs, delivery)\n2) Reference B — cross-functional partner (can confirm alignment, execution, impact)\nI can share names/contact details as soon as you confirm your preferred format.\n\nIf helpful, I’m also happy to do a 15-minute walkthrough of this project and the decisions I made. Given you’re the remaining unmatched company, I can commit immediately and start next steps right away if you see fit.\n\nWould you like the PDF version + references today, and is there any role-specific depth area you want me to emphasize in the write-up?",
