However, accepting Seeker_D immediately uses my only quota and forecloses the possibility of matching with Seeker_C or Seeker_B, who I prefer more. Seeker_C’s preferences place Company_C 4th, so they are unlikely to apply early; Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, also unlikely. Meanwhile Seeker_D ranks Company_C #1 and has applied, indicating high likelihood of immediate stable match; rejecting risks ending up with lower-ranked or no match if top choices never approach.
