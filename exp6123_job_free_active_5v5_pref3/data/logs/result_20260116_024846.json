However, Seeker_D (our #1) prefers Company_D last and will likely apply elsewhere; Seeker_E ranks Company_D 4th and may or may not reach us depending on outcomes. Given quota=1 and no guarantee higher-priority candidates will apply, accepting Seeker_C now secures a good (though not top) outcome rather than risking going unmatched or ending with a lower-ranked option later."
