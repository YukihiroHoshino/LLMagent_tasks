Result: cycle time reduced ~30% and error rate dropped materially (fewer rework loops), with a documented playbook so the improvement stuck.\n- Project 2 (Cross-functional delivery): I owned a cross-team initiative with unclear requirements at the start; I drove alignment via a written spec, weekly stakeholder updates, and milestone-based execution. Result: delivered on schedule, improved stakeholder satisfaction (fewer escalations/last-minute changes), and created dashboards to make progress and outcomes visible.\n\n2) Most relevant skills/domain I bring\n- Strong ownership and execution in messy/ambiguous environments (I’m comfortable defining scope, writing the plan, and driving to closure).\n- Clear written communication (status updates, specs, decision logs) and stakeholder management.\n- Data-informed problem solving (basic analysis/metrics, dashboards, and using numbers to prioritize and validate impact).\n\n3) Start date/constraints\n- Earliest start: immediately (within 1–2 weeks).
