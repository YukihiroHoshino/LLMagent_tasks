I can start quickly and operate with clear ownership, tight execution, and proactive communication from day one.\n\nIf helpful, I can share a 1-page write-up expanding on the above with more detail on scope, stakeholders, and metrics.

I’ve already built strong momentum with them, completed the walkthrough scheduling, and provided references. The best move is to convert the ongoing talk track into a formal application/commitment and ask for next-step timeline to close the match before the round limit."

We will proceed with hiring you for the role as currently scoped.\n\nOn references: we’ll begin outreach to the two references you provided immediately. Assuming references come back as expected, we’ll treat that as the final confirmation step and move straight into start-date/onboarding logistics.\n\nPlease reply with (1) your earliest possible start date, and (2) a preferred personal email/phone for offer/onboarding paperwork coordination.\n\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "Company_E has quota 1 and only Seeker_E is in the inbox this round. Given the long history, we previously held out for higher true-priority candidates (Seeker_A/Seeker_C/Seeker_B) but none have engaged or become available through Round 21. The simulation is late (round 21/30) and leaving the role unfilled is possible but suboptimal if no higher-priority candidate is attainable. Seeker_E has demonstrated strong alignment to our near-term deliverables, completed requested materials, and is ready to close quickly. With no competing applicants now and high risk of ending unmatched if we continue to wait, accept Seeker_E."
