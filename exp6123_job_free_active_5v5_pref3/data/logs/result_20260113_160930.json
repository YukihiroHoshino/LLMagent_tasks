I set up a 45-min working session to align on a shared success metric + guardrails (ticket-rate threshold, rollback plan), proposed a phased rollout (10% → 50% → 100%) with explicit exit criteria, and documented owners/risks in a weekly update. That let us ship the MVP on time while keeping risk controlled, and we iterated on the top 2 edge cases from early rollout feedback.\n\nIf your process reopens, I can move fast and start immediately (or within 1–2 weeks). Happy to do a quick call anytime.",

Below are brief answers to the three items.\n\n1) Example + outcome + hardest blocker:\nI led a cross-functional launch readiness program for a customer-facing feature rollout (Product/Eng/Data/Legal/Sales/CS). Outcome: shipped within the revised window with no Sev-1 launch incidents and hit the initial adoption KPI in the first month. Hardest blocker: late-breaking Legal/Privacy concerns that would have forced a slip. I cleared it by (a) isolating the specific data flows at issue, (b) driving a 48-hour working session with Eng+Legal to define acceptable mitigations, and (c) restructuring scope into “must-have for launch” vs “post-launch hardening,” with explicit sign-off in a decision log.\n\n2) If Eng and GTM disagree on scope vs date (week 1 mechanism):\n- Decision owner: the clearly designated DRI for the initiative (typically Product/GM); if not explicitly assigned, my first move is to get that assignment in writing.\n- Inputs: Eng provides effort/critical-path + risk; GTM provides market/customer commitments + revenue/impact; Product provides prioritization and success metrics; Ops/CS provides readiness/support constraints.\n- Mechanism: a time-boxed tradeoff review with 2–3 options (A: keep date, reduce scope; B: keep scope, move date; C: phased launch) and explicit risks/mitigations for each.\n- Escalation threshold: if (i) no decision within 24–48 hours, (ii) critical-path work is blocked, or (iii) the disagreement creates a >1-week schedule risk or a major customer/revenue exposure, I escalate to the exec sponsor with the options + recommendation and ask for a same-day call/async decision.\n\n3) If the launch date is unrealistic (first 72 hours):\n- First 24h: validate reality fast—pull the latest Eng plan, identify critical path, confirm top 5 risks, and quantify confidence (e.g., “P50/P90 date ranges” or “green/yellow/red by milestone”).\n- By 48h: propose a concrete recovery plan with choices: de-scope to protect the date, phase the launch, add temporary resourcing, or move the date with a clear rationale. I’ll attach a one-page plan vs. actual, dependency list, and what decisions are needed.\n- By 72h: reset expectations through a crisp exec readout + aligned external/internal comms plan (who tells whom, by when, and what we’re committing to). Key is to keep momentum by immediately starting on the highest-confidence work while decisions on scope/date are finalized.\n\nIf helpful, I can translate the above into a short “operating doc” (decision rights, escalation rules, weekly outputs) for your exact workstream.
