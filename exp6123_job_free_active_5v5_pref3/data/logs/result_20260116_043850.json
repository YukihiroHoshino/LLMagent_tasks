Set weekly milestones, ran status/risk reviews, unblocked dependencies, and drove launch readiness. Outcome: shipped on schedule; reduced open issues at launch via structured triage and clear owners.\n\n2) Process + execution improvement: Took over a recurring backlog area that was slipping due to bandwidth. Re-scoped into a prioritized roadmap, established SLAs/definition-of-done, and implemented a simple cadence for stakeholder updates. Outcome: improved throughput and predictability (fewer carry-overs week to week) and faster turnaround on highest-priority items.\n\n3) Stakeholder-facing ownership: Served as the single point of accountability for a multi-stakeholder initiative—gathered requirements, translated into an execution plan, managed tradeoffs, and closed the loop with clear comms. Outcome: fewer last-minute scope changes and smoother sign-offs.\n\nIf you can share the specific domain/role scope you’re hiring for (even 2–3 lines), I can map the closest example directly to it.

I prioritized reliability and a smaller, well-defined scope (based on impact/risk and downstream support cost), documented what was deferred, and aligned stakeholders on a staged rollout.\n\nIf this maps tightly enough to your domain-specific delivery scope, I’d like to move to the next step.

Below is a concrete plan (happy to adapt to your most urgent domain area).\n\n**Domain clarifier (prior example):** the internal workflow I owned was primarily **ops tooling / internal intake + triage system** (cross-functional requests routed through an intake form/queue, prioritized, executed, and released with stakeholder sign-off). I’ve also partnered closely with support + data teams on similar intake→delivery pipelines.\n\n## Proposed 3-week trial (can extend to 4 if needed)\n1) **Problem/backlog area (pick one):** “Intake → triage → execution” queue for a single domain-specific delivery area where requests are currently slowing down or bouncing due to unclear requirements/ownership (i.e., the highest-noise, highest-repeat request category).\n\n2) **Week-by-week deliverables (artifacts + outcomes):**\n- **Week 1 (Diagnose + baseline):**\n  - Artifact: request taxonomy + lightweight triage rubric (priority/impact/effort/risk), and a clear Definition-of-Ready/Done.\n  - Outcome: baseline dashboard for cycle time + reopen rate + WIP; identify top 3 recurring blockers.\n  - Run: stakeholder alignment session + set a weekly cadence (planning + mid-week risk review).\n- **Week 2 (Execute + unblock):**\n  - Artifact: prioritized mini-roadmap for the queue + owners per item; updated templates for requirements/acceptance criteria.\n  - Outcome: deliver 2–4 high-priority items end-to-end (requirements → execution coordination → validation → release/hand-off).\n  - Implement: pre-release checklist to reduce regressions/reopens.\n- **Week 3 (Stabilize + handoff):**\n  - Artifact: playbook for intake/triage, KPI report (before/after), and a proposed 30-day follow-on plan.\n  - Outcome: demonstrate measurable improvement on agreed metrics; train/hand off the operating cadence.\n\n3) **Metrics to move (baseline, target, measurement):**\n- **Cycle time (request created → delivered):** baseline from your tracker; **target 20–30% reduction** for the chosen request category by end of trial (measured via timestamps).\n- **Reopen/rollback rate (quality/reliability):** baseline last 4–8 weeks; **target 15–25% reduction** via clearer acceptance criteria + checklist (measured via ticket status changes / incident tags).\n- **WIP / aging tickets:** baseline current; **target 20% reduction** in tickets older than X days for that category (measured via aging report).\n\n4) **Stakeholders/functions needed:**\n- 1 domain owner/PM (or equivalent), 1–2 engineering counterparts, and whoever owns the upstream requesters (ops/support/etc.).\n- Access to the ticketing system + any existing SLA/KPI reporting; ability to schedule a 30-min weekly stakeholder review.\n\n5) **Assumptions/constraints:**\n- Scope limited to **one** request category/queue slice to keep it measurable.\n- I’m accountable for driving clarity, coordination, and delivery; engineering execution remains with existing dev owners.\n- Success depends on timely access to data (timestamps/status history) and stakeholder availability for 2–3 short syncs/week.\n\nIf you tell me which domain-specific delivery area is most urgent right now (even 1–2 sentences) and what tooling you use to track work (Jira/Linear/ServiceNow/etc.), I can tighten this into a one-page trial charter with exact baselines/targets and the initial backlog slice to tackle.",

We can support moving forward with these five: **CSOPS-418, CSOPS-421, CSOPS-425, CSOPS-427, CSOPS-436**.\n\nHere are the stakeholders/owners to unblock Week 1:\n- **Support Ops lead / approver (wording + policy):** Dana R. (Support Ops)\n- **Eng owner for macro/automation changes (CSOPS):** Miguel S. (Eng)\n- **Tier 2 ops owner (VIP routing input):** Priya K. (Tier 2 Lead)\n- **Compliance/legal wording source (as needed):** Legal intake via Dana (we’ll route any required approvals through her)\n\nAccess/permissions:\n- We’ll grant you **Jira CSOPS project access** (edit issues, comment, update fields) and view access to the existing cycle-time dashboard. Workflow/admin changes still go through Miguel.\n\nProposed kickoff + cadence (confirm what works):\n- **Kickoff (60 min):** Monday 10:00–11:00\n- **Mid-week risk review (30 min):** Wednesday 11:00–11:30\n- **Weekly stakeholder review (30 min):** Friday 2:00–2:30\n\nBefore kickoff, please send:\n1) A 1-page kickoff agenda, and\n2) Your Week-1 outputs checklist (triage rubric + DoR/DoD + baseline pull + top blockers) mapped to these five tickets.\n\nOnce you confirm the kickoff time, we’ll lock the start date and operationalize the 3-week trial.

No other seekers are currently in our inbox this round, and delaying further risks ending unmatched. Since Seeker_E is still on our acceptable list and now presents low execution risk with a structured trial, continue dialogue to finalize stakeholders/start date rather than accept a full hire immediately (acceptance only occurs on [APPLY])."
