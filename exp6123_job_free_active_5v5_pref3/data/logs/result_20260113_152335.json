We have quota 1 and are currently unmatched, so accepting Seeker_E would lock us in and prevent matching with higher-priority Seeker_B or Seeker_D if they approach later. Seeker_E has applied multiple times and we have repeatedly rejected based on relative fit/priorities; while their latest bullets are closer to what we asked for, the details are still high-level placeholders (X/Y/Z) and don’t change our ordering or the strategic decision to keep the slot for higher-priority candidates. Given we prefer leaving the role unfilled over hiring outside our priorities and Seeker_E is within the list but low, the optimal move is to continue holding for higher-ranked seekers rather than accept now. Therefore: reject, with a clear explanation and respectful closure."
