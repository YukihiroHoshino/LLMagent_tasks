With quota 1, I should not accept a lower-priority candidate if there is a reasonable chance to secure a higher-priority one later. Seeker_D is my #3 and has Company_C as their #1, so acceptance would likely lock a stable match. However, Seeker_E is my #4 and also has Company_C as #1; between D and E, D is better. The key risk is missing Seeker_C (#1) or Seeker_B (#2). Seeker_C’s top choice is Company_D, and Company_D ranks Seeker_C #3 (behind Seeker_D and Seeker_E), so Seeker_C may or may not end up with D. Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_B, and Company_B ranks Seeker_B #3; Seeker_B may not secure B and could later approach Company_C (though Company_C is Seeker_B’s last choice, making that less likely). Given Seeker_C does not prefer Company_C highly (it’s #4), the probability they apply to us early is low. Therefore, locking in Seeker_D (#3) who strongly prefers us is a good outcome within quota, better than waiting with significant uncertainty."

However, we have already rejected Seeker_C twice, which credibly signals we are holding the slot for higher-priority candidates. Accepting Seeker_C now would risk blocking a later match with Seeker_D or Seeker_E, who are both preferred by us and may still become available as the market evolves. In addition, Seeker_C is actively pursuing us because we are their top choice, but that alone does not outweigh our priority ordering given quota=1 and no evidence that Seeker_D/Seeker_E are unattainable yet. Consistency and strategic patience suggests rejecting again rather than reversing course without new information that materially changes their standing. Therefore, reject while keeping the door open only if circumstances change later (though the protocol requires a clear accept/reject now)."

Shipped: unified intake form + triage rubric, weekly dashboard, and a lightweight KB workflow (ownership, SLAs, and escalation paths). Result: backlog down ~45% in 6 weeks; median first response time improved ~30%; fewer repeat tickets.\n\n2) Goal: Launch an internal “single source of truth” for cross-team project status. Constraints: stakeholders had conflicting definitions/metrics; low tolerance for process overhead. Shipped: a simple status schema, one-page weekly update template, and automated rollups (clear owners + decision log). Result: reduced ad-hoc status pings; improved on-time delivery (missed milestones down materially over the next quarter) and faster decision cycles.\n\n3) Goal: Improve a flaky workflow causing rework and missed deadlines. Constraints: unclear root cause; limited observability; tight timeline. Shipped: instrumented key steps, identified failure modes, implemented guardrails + retry logic, and documented runbooks. Result: failure rate reduced significantly; rework hours dropped; stakeholders regained confidence in timelines.\n\nIf this is sufficient, I’m happy to do either (a) the 15–20 minute scenario screen today/tomorrow or (b) the ≤24h trial task.
