In this round, only Seeker_D and Seeker_E applied; Seeker_E is ranked 4th, so Seeker_D is preferable between current applicants. However, accepting Seeker_D now would fill our only slot and block the possibility of matching with Seeker_C or Seeker_B later. Given overall preferences, Seeker_C prefers Company_D/A/B over Company_C (so may never reach us), and Seeker_B ranks Company_C last (unlikely to apply). Seeker_D ranks Company_C #1 and is applying now, making them a high-probability secure match.
