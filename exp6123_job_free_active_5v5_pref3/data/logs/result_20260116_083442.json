This suggests our top choices (A/C) are unlikely to come to us, and even B/D may secure higher-preference offers elsewhere. However, holding out could still yield Seeker_B or Seeker_D later, which would be higher than Seeker_E. Since Seeker_E is applying now and may be taken by other companies if we delay, but we are their last choice so they might accept elsewhere only if rejected broadly. With limited information and to avoid ending unmatched, we can accept Seeker_E now, but this sacrifices the chance at B/D. In a typical deferred-acceptance dynamic, it's risky to accept a low-ranked candidate early. Therefore, reject to preserve capacity for higher-priority seekers who may apply in later rounds."
