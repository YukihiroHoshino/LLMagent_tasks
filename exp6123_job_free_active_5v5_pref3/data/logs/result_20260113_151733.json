Still, accepting Seeker_C now would fill our only slot and foreclose any chance (however small) of landing Seeker_D/Seeker_E if market dynamics shift. Given Seeker_C has us as top choice and is applying now, the probability-weighted outcome favors accepting a strong #3 rather than risking ending unmatched or with a lower-ranked candidate later."
