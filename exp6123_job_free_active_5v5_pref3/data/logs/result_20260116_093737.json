However, Seeker_D (our #1) ranks Company_B as #3 and Seeker_A (our #2) ranks Company_B as #4, meaning they may apply elsewhere first but could become available later. With 30 rounds and no immediate pressure, it’s strategically better to preserve the quota and try to attract higher-priority candidates rather than immediately accept our 3rd choice.

Accepting Seeker_C now secures the best possible match for Company_C and avoids the risk that Seeker_C matches elsewhere (they rank us 4th, so they could pivot to Company_D/A/B). With full information, locking in the top candidate is optimal."
