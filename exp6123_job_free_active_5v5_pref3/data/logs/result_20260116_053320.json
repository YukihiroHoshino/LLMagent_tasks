However, Seeker_D ranks Company_C as their top choice, so accepting would lock in a solid candidate. Yet Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th and Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, making it unlikely they will apply soon (or at all). Still, there is some chance Seeker_A (who ranks Company_C 2nd) could apply later, but Company_C ranks Seeker_A last. Given we prefer higher-ranked candidates and have only one slot, accepting Seeker_D now secures a high-priority match and avoids risking ending up with a lower-priority candidate like Seeker_E or Seeker_A if the top two never approach."

Since we can’t initiate outreach and there is still time (round 2/30), the best move to maximize our outcome is to reject Seeker_E to keep capacity for Seeker_B/Seeker_D, accepting the risk of remaining unmatched if they never apply."
