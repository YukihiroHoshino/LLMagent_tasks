However, my top two targets (Seeker_C and Seeker_B) have not applied yet, and based on their preferences they rank Company_C 4th (Seeker_C) and 5th (Seeker_B), so they are unlikely to approach me early. Still, accepting Seeker_D now would consume my only quota and prevent upgrading if Seeker_C later becomes available. Given Seeker_D is a strong, high-ranked option (3rd) and is proactively applying with clear commitment, the risk of holding out and ending unmatched outweighs the low probability of landing Seeker_C/Seeker_B.

Drove decisions by escalating blockers within 24 hours and aligning stakeholders on tradeoffs.\n- Outcome: Cut median onboarding time from ~10 days to ~6 days (40% improvement) and reduced handoff-related tickets by ~25% over the following month.\n\n2) Operational problem-solving (ambiguity → process + metrics):\n- Scope: Took an ambiguous “too many repeat incidents” problem across Support/Eng.\n- Actions: Defined a simple taxonomy for incident types, implemented a weekly review, added leading indicators (time-to-triage, reopen rate), and created a lightweight playbook + checklist for the top 3 recurring issues.\n- Outcome: Improved time-to-triage by ~30% and reduced repeat incidents by ~20% over 6–8 weeks.\n\nCadence/artifacts:\n- Weekly stakeholder update (1-page): goals, progress vs plan, key decisions needed, top risks + mitigations.\n- Dashboard (basic): throughput, cycle time, SLA adherence, and a small set of leading indicators.\n- RAID log + decision log, reviewed twice weekly.\n\nHindsight: I’d add earlier “pre-mortem” risk review with stakeholders in week 1 and define explicit acceptance criteria per workstream sooner to reduce late-stage churn.\n\nIf this aligns with what you’re prioritizing, I’d love to be reconsidered—I’m ready to commit quickly.
