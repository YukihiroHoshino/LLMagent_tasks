After reviewing our current hiring priorities for this cycle, we won’t be moving forward with your application at this time. We appreciate you reaching out and wish you the best in your search.",
              "thought": "Seeker_E is 4th on our true priority list (A, C, B, E, D). We still have full quota (1) and no current match. However, higher-priority candidates (Seeker_A/Seeker_C/Seeker_B) may still be attainable if we wait; accepting Seeker_E now would lock our only slot and could prevent a better match. Also, Seeker_E ranks Company_E last, suggesting low likelihood they will stay engaged unless other options fail, but they are applying now. Given the market rules (acceptance creates an immediate match), the optimal strategy is to reject Seeker_E to preserve capacity for higher-priority seekers."

With quota 1 still open, accepting Seeker_E now would lock us in with our 4th-choice and eliminate the chance to match with Seeker_C or Seeker_B later. Seeker_E strongly prefers Company_C (top choice), but that mainly benefits us only if we cannot attract higher-priority candidates. Given the market, Seeker_C prefers Company_D first and may not come to us immediately, but could later if rejected elsewhere; Seeker_B ranks us last and is unlikely; Seeker_D already applied and was rejected by us; Seeker_A also applied and was rejected. Since we still have time (round 4/30) and only one applicant in the inbox, the best move to maximize our outcome is to keep the slot open and reject Seeker_E again rather than settle now. This preserves optionality for Seeker_C (and, less likely, Seeker_B) in future rounds."
