However, Seeker_D (our #1) ranks Company_D last, so is unlikely to apply/accept us unless they fail elsewhere; Seeker_E ranks us #4, also not a strong likelihood. Given quota=1 and no higher-priority applicants in the inbox, accepting Seeker_C secures a good (top-3) outcome and avoids the risk of ending unmatched while waiting for unlikely higher-priority candidates."

Since we still have quota 1 and it’s only round 1, it is strategically better to hold the slot for a higher-priority candidate who may still apply in subsequent rounds. Rejecting now preserves the option to match with Seeker_B or Seeker_D later; accepting now would foreclose that. Given the market information, Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_B and Seeker_D’s top choice is Company_C, so they may not come to us immediately, but they could if rejected elsewhere.
