Seeker_E is on my priority list (4th), so I prefer accepting them over leaving the role unfilled. However, Seeker_B (my top choice) ranks Company_A 3rd and may still apply later; Seeker_D (2nd) ranks Company_A 2nd and may also apply. With a quota of 1, accepting Seeker_E now locks me out of potentially better matches, but there is no guarantee B or D will apply to me in future rounds (they may match with their higher-preference companies first). Given I cannot ask for [TALK] when they have [APPLY] and must choose now, and since Seeker_E is acceptable and I want to avoid ending unmatched, I will accept."

I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute at Company_E, especially in an environment that values clear ownership and dependable execution. In prior roles, I’ve taken ambiguous goals and turned them into scoped plans with measurable milestones, aligned stakeholders early, and delivered high-quality results on tight timelines while communicating risks proactively. I’d welcome the chance to interview and discuss how I can contribute to your team’s immediate priorities. Thank you for your consideration.",

              "thought": "Seeker_C is #2 on Company_E’s true priority list (after Seeker_A). In the current round, only Seeker_C has applied to us, and we have quota 1 with no existing matches. While holding out for Seeker_A could yield a better outcome, Seeker_A ranks Company_E last and is unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere, making that prospect low. Accepting Seeker_C now secures a high-priority candidate and avoids the risk of ending unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked seeker later. Given market preferences, Seeker_C also ranks Company_E last, but they have proactively applied, indicating genuine willingness to match now."
