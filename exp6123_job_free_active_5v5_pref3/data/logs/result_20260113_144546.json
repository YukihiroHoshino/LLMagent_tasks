Given the market info: Seeker_D ranks Company_D last, so unlikely to apply; Seeker_E ranks Company_D 4th, also not likely to apply soon. However, in round 1 we should still preserve optionality and avoid committing to a mid-priority candidate immediately; we can reject now and try to attract higher-priority seekers, accepting the risk of ending unmatched if they never apply.

Since our quota is 1, accepting Seeker_D now would block any chance at Seeker_C. Given Seeker_D ranks Company_C as #1, we have strong leverage to wait a round or two while keeping them warm; rejecting risks losing them to Company_A/B, but Seeker_D’s preference list suggests they may try Company_A next, which might accept them (Company_A ranks Seeker_D #2). Still, to preserve upside for Seeker_C while not overcommitting, we should reject now (no hold option exists) and encourage re-application if still available next round—though this risks losing them, it’s the only way to keep the slot open for higher-priority candidates."
