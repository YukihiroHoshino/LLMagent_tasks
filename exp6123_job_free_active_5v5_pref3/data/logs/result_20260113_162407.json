Seeker_D is top for Company_B but is also top for Company_D and ranks Company_B only #3; likely to pursue Company_C/#1 or Company_A/#2 first, and Company_D will strongly compete. Seeker_A ranks Company_B #4 and is less likely to apply early. Given round 1 and no other inbound applicants, it’s worth waiting to try for Seeker_D/A; rejecting risks losing Seeker_B, but we can attempt to keep them warm via dialogue is not allowed on APPLY.
