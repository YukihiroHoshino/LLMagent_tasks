If still tied, use a simple principle: protect the critical path and the metric we committed to for the milestone.\n- After decision: document the call + rationale in the single source of truth so we don’t relitigate.\n\n2) Smallest weekly leading-indicator set + initial targets (first 4–6 weeks)\nI’d keep it to 4 indicators that are hard to game and directly tied to your priorities:\n- On-time milestone rate (weekly): target +10–15 pts by week 6 (e.g., 70% → 80–85%).\n- Blocker aging (median days blocked + # blockers >7 days): target 20–30% reduction by week 6; and drive “>7 days” blockers toward zero.\n- Cycle time for the most relevant segment (pick one segment first, e.g., intake→kickoff or kickoff→execution start): target 10–15% reduction by week 6.\n- Rework / churn proxy (e.g., # of scope changes after kickoff or # of reopened tasks): target 15–25% reduction by week 6.\n\nIf this aligns, I’d love to move to next steps immediately and formally apply for the open role—happy to do a quick final screen/loop this week and stay highly responsive.\n",
