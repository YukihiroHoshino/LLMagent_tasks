Given full information: Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_B and Company_B ranks Seeker_B 3rd, so Seeker_B may still be attainable later; Seeker_D’s top choice is Company_C and Company_C ranks Seeker_D 3rd, so Seeker_D may also be attainable later. If we accept Seeker_A now, we forgo chances at higher-priority Seeker_B/Seeker_D. Since we can only respond to this applicant now with accept/reject, the best strategy to maximize match quality is to reject and keep quota open to pursue higher-priority candidates in subsequent rounds."

However, Seeker_B ranks Company_B as their #1 choice, making acceptance highly likely to secure our single quota immediately. Seeker_D ranks Company_B as #3 (behind Company_C and Company_A) and Seeker_A ranks Company_B as #4, so waiting for them is risky and could leave us unmatched if they accept offers elsewhere. With only one current applicant and a quota of 1, locking in Seeker_B now maximizes certainty while still matching within our acceptable priority list."

In this round, only Seeker_D and Seeker_E applied; Seeker_E is ranked 4th, so Seeker_D is preferable among current applicants. However, Seeker_C (our top choice) prefers Company_D then A/B before us, and Seeker_B ranks us last—so neither is likely to apply to us early. Seeker_D ranks Company_C as #1, meaning accepting now likely secures a stable match and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower-priority candidate later.
