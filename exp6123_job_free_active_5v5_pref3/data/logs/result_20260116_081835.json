However, Company_A has repeatedly and explicitly stated they are holding the seat for higher-priority candidates and that their decision is unlikely to change. Given that, an [APPLY] would likely be wasted and could be counterproductive. I will send a concise [TALK] message to check whether any of their higher-priority candidates are definitively unavailable now; if so, I’ll ask whether they are willing to broaden to me immediately.

I can’t share real-time status about other candidates’ engagements, but I can confirm this: as of this round, we are still keeping the seat open for candidates higher on our priority list and we have not decided to broaden the search.\n\nSo I don’t want to imply there’s a near-term path to an offer from us. If we do materially change course and broaden, we would proactively reach back out—but you should assume we won’t be moving forward and plan accordingly.",

Seeker_E is asking whether top-tier candidates are still available. From global preferences, Seeker_B ranks Company_A 3rd and Seeker_D ranks Company_A 2nd, so both could plausibly still be engaged elsewhere; however, we have no direct confirmation they are unavailable. Given our stated commitment to hold for higher-priority candidates and the fact this is a [TALK] (no need to decide accept/reject), we should respond consistently: we can’t share real-time details, but we are still pursuing higher-priority candidates and have not broadened. Encourage Seeker_E to move on; keep option open only if we formally broaden later."

However, by round 8 the only inbound is Seeker_E, and the history indicates Seeker_E is the only remaining unmatched seeker repeatedly engaging; the higher-priority candidates (B, D, A) are likely matched elsewhere given the market progression and their preferences. Keeping the seat open longer risks ending unmatched through round 30, which is worse than hiring an in-list candidate. Since Seeker_E is offering immediate commitment, the best achievable outcome now is to broaden to Seeker_E and close the match rather than hold out indefinitely for unavailable top-tier candidates."
