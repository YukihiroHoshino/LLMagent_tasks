Given seekers’ preferences: Seeker_D ranks Company_D last, so unlikely to apply; Seeker_E ranks Company_D 4th, may apply if rejected elsewhere. However, there is no guarantee either will apply to us, while Seeker_C has already applied and ranks Company_D #1, making acceptance a secure match with a high-ranked candidate.
