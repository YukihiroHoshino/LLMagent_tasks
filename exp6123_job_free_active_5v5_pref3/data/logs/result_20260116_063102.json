Although Company_B is high on my true preference list, they have repeatedly and definitively closed my candidacy for this specific opening and asked for no further engagement. Given the rules and the market-record context, I should not submit another [APPLY]. The least disruptive action is a final [TALK] note confirming I remain withdrawn and will stay unmatched, which aligns with my preference to avoid further outreach and avoids attempting to reopen a closed decision."

We confirm again that you remain formally withdrawn and that your candidacy is closed for this specific opening in this cycle. No further action is needed from you, and we won’t be engaging further on this role this cycle. Thank you. [TALK]",

With round 30 and no higher-priority candidates engaging (Seeker_D/Seeker_A/Seeker_B), there is still no basis to reverse our definitive decision. Since the seeker sent [TALK], we must respond with [TALK] and simply acknowledge closure without reopening candidacy."
