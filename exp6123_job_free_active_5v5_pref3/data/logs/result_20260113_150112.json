In this round, Seeker_D (ranked 3rd) also applied and lists Company_C as top choice, making them a stronger immediate option. With quota=1, accepting Seeker_E now would block a higher-priority match. Given Seeker_E has other high options and Company_C can likely secure Seeker_D (or wait for Seeker_C/Seeker_B in later rounds), the best move is to reject Seeker_E to preserve capacity for higher-ranked candidates."

However, holding out could potentially yield Seeker_C or Seeker_B later, who are higher priorities. Given the uncertainty of future rounds and that Seeker_D is still a high-priority (3rd) candidate who is ready to commit, accepting Seeker_D now maximizes the chance of filling the role with a strong preferred candidate rather than risking ending up with a lower choice or no match."

There is a meaningful chance neither top choice applies to us soon, and waiting risks ending up unmatched or forced to reject later due to quota constraints.
