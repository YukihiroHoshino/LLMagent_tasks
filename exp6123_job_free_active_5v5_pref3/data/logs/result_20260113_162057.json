Here’s a concise 30–60 day plan aligned to end-to-end ownership, fast execution, and clear comms.\n\nFirst 30 days (outcomes + measurable criteria)\n1) Align on success + ship a first usable milestone: In week 1, confirm scope, users, constraints, and “done” metrics; by end of week 2, deliver a PRD/spec + execution plan (milestones, risks, owners). Success = written spec approved + timeline agreed within 10 business days.\n2) Deliver an MVP to real users and close the loop: Build/ship MVP by week 3–4 with instrumentation + basic operational runbook. Success = MVP in production (or live to pilot users), with 1–2 key metrics tracked and ≥1 feedback cycle completed.\n3) Establish lightweight operating cadence: Weekly status (progress/risks/asks), decision log, and risk register with mitigations. Success = stakeholders report “no surprises”; risks surfaced within 24 hours of discovery.\n\nBy day 60 (what I’d ship/operationalize)\n- Ship V1 improvements based on pilot feedback (top 2–3 issues addressed), harden reliability/perf, and document ownership/hand-off. Success = measurable lift in the primary metric (e.g., adoption, cycle time, error rate) and an on-call/ops plan that reduces escalations.\n- If applicable, expand rollout from pilot to broader audience with a clear go/no-go checklist.\n\nComparable example (ownership + impact)\n- I owned an end-to-end internal workflow project: clarified requirements with cross-functional stakeholders, defined success metrics, shipped an MVP quickly, then iterated based on usage data and feedback. Result: reduced turnaround time and eliminated recurring manual steps; stakeholders had predictable weekly updates and faster decision-making.\n\nAvailability\n- I can start immediately (within 1 week) and can prioritize your project from day 1.\n\nIf helpful, I can also share a one-page template (spec + milestone plan + risk register) I use to keep projects moving quickly and transparently.

Here are direct answers to your three questions.\n\n1) Most technical/complex part of the internal workflow project I owned\n- Systems/integrations: The workflow spanned a ticketing/intake tool + an internal service + a data store + notifications (Slack/email). The hardest part was stitching together reliable state transitions across systems (webhooks/async jobs), plus permissions/identity mapping.\n- Data quality: Intake data was inconsistent (missing fields, free-text). I added validation at the edge, defined a canonical schema, and implemented backfills + monitoring (error budgets/alerts) so we could trust the cycle-time metrics.\n- Reliability: Idempotency + retries were key (duplicate events, partial failures). I introduced idempotency keys, dead-letter handling, and a small dashboard for failure modes so ops wasn’t guessing.\n\n2) How I decide what to cut vs keep for an MVP when stakeholders disagree\n- Start from the metric + user journey: I write the single primary success metric (e.g., “reduce handoff time from X→Y”) and the minimal happy-path flow needed to move it.\n- MoSCoW + explicit tradeoffs: I run a quick Must/Should/Could/Won’t workshop and force each “Must” to tie to the metric or a hard constraint (compliance/security).\n- Timebox + decision rule: If there’s disagreement, I propose a timeboxed MVP (e.g., 2 weeks) and a decision rule: ship the smallest version that is (a) usable by the pilot, (b) instrumented, and (c) safe to operate. Anything else becomes a V1 backlog item with an owner and revisit date.\n- De-risk first: If a disputed item is actually a risk (e.g., integration uncertainty), I pull it forward as a spike/prototype rather than bloating MVP scope.\n\n3) Cadence/artifacts for “no surprises” (example structure)\n- Weekly 1-pager status (posted same day/time):\n  - Goal this week\n  - Shipped / completed (links)\n  - In progress (with ETA)\n  - Top risks (severity, mitigation, owner, decision needed)\n  - Asks / decisions needed (with deadline)\n  - Next week plan\n- Lightweight risk log (kept current): Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger | Owner | Date.\n- Simple metric dashboard: cycle time, volume, error rate, adoption (pilot usage). Reviewed weekly.\n- Decision log: what we decided, why, and who approved—prevents re-litigating.\n\nIf helpful, I can tailor the above to your workflow/productivity initiative and propose an MVP cut + metrics in a short doc within 24 hours.\n\nGiven this, what’s the fastest formal next step on your side (e.g., a scoped exercise or final interview)? I’m available immediately and can start within 1 week.",

From seekers’ preferences: Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th; Seeker_B ranks Company_C last; Seeker_D ranks Company_C 1st (but we previously rejected them); Seeker_A ranks Company_C 2nd (previously rejected). Given Seeker_B is unlikely to apply to us, and Seeker_C prefers D/A/B over us, our best realistic higher-priority option would be Seeker_D, but we already rejected them and they may pursue Company_A/B where they are highly ranked. Therefore, continuing to talk with Seeker_E to potentially convert to an apply soon is prudent, but we should avoid committing immediately in case Seeker_C unexpectedly becomes available.
