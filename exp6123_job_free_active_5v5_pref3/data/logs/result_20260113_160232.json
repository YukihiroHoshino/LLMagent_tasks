Seeker_D ranks Company_B 3rd (after Company_C and Company_A), so they are unlikely to apply to us in round 1; Seeker_A ranks us 4th, also unlikely early. However, Company_D and Company_C both rank Seeker_D highly, and Company_A ranks Seeker_B #1, so waiting could be risky if we end up unmatched. Still, since Seeker_B has applied and states we are their top choice, accepting secures a solid match now rather than gambling on higher-priority candidates who may never reach us.
