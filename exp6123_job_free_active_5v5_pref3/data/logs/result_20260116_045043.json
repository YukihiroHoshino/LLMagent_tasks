Looking at their preferences: Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th (likely to apply elsewhere first), while Seeker_B ranks Company_C last (unlikely to apply). Seeker_D ranks Company_C 1st, making acceptance likely to secure a match now. Risk of waiting: I may end up with Seeker_E or Seeker_A later, or remain unmatched if higher-priority seekers never come.
