There are no other inbound applications this round, and waiting risks losing Seeker_B to another company while there is no guarantee Seeker_D or Seeker_A will apply to Company_B (both prefer other companies first). With quota 1, accepting Seeker_B secures a solid, high-priority match rather than gambling for a higher-ranked candidate who may never engage."

We have quota 1 and only Seeker_A applied to us this round, but accepting now could block us from matching with higher-priority candidates who may approach in later rounds. Given full information: Seeker_B’s top choice is Company_B, and Company_B ranks Seeker_B 3rd (behind Seeker_D and Seeker_A), so Seeker_B might end up seeking Company_A if rejected by Company_B. Seeker_D’s top choice is Company_C; Company_C ranks Seeker_D 3rd, so Seeker_D could also later pivot to Company_A (where we rank them 2nd). Therefore, it is strategically better to reject Seeker_A now to preserve capacity for higher-priority candidates, accepting the risk of remaining unmatched."

However, Seeker_D’s top choice is Company_C, so there is a strong chance to secure them later if needed. Meanwhile, Seeker_C (our top choice) currently prefers Company_D then Company_A/B before Company_C, so they may not approach us early; Seeker_B ranks us last, making them unlikely. Given quota=1, accepting Seeker_D now would lock us in and foreclose any chance (however small) of landing Seeker_C. Since Seeker_D is likely to remain available to us longer due to their preference, it is strategically better to reject now and keep the slot open to pursue higher-priority candidates in subsequent rounds."

Seeker_E ranks 4th on our list and has Company_C as their top choice, making acceptance likely to stick and fill our single quota immediately. Waiting for Seeker_C/Seeker_B is risky because they prefer other companies (Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th; Seeker_B ranks Company_C last) and may match elsewhere.

However, Seeker_B’s preferences rank Company_A 3rd (after Company_B and Company_D), and those companies also have strong priorities that could attract/accept Seeker_B (Company_D ranks Seeker_B 4th; Company_B ranks Seeker_B 3rd). There is meaningful risk that Seeker_B never applies to us or is accepted elsewhere first. Accepting Seeker_D now secures a high-ranked candidate and fills our single quota, which is preferable to risking an unfilled role."
