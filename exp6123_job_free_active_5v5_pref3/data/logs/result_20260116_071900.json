Seeker_D ranks Company_A 2nd but will likely apply to Company_C first (top), where Company_C ranks Seeker_D 3rd and may accept Seeker_D if Seeker_C/Seeker_B don’t take it; still, Seeker_D might not reach us.

Seeker_C’s top choice is Company_D and ranks Company_C 4th, so they are unlikely to approach us early; Seeker_B ranks Company_C last, also unlikely to apply.

Per your note, here’s a concise 30/60/90-day plan + comparable outcomes + the 3 specifics.\n\n30/60/90 (1-page version)\n• First 30 days (Diagnose + deliver quick wins): align on success metrics and current priorities; map stakeholders + operating cadence; audit the current workflow/tooling; ship 1–2 low-risk improvements that remove friction (e.g., clearer intake/triage, tighter execution checkpoints) and establish a weekly KPI dashboard.\n• Days 31–60 (Own a workstream end-to-end): take full ownership of one high-impact workstream; define scope, milestones, and measurable outcomes; run execution with a tight feedback loop; document the playbook so the team can repeat it.\n• Days 61–90 (Scale + harden): expand the playbook to adjacent areas; put durable processes in place (SOPs, SLAs, quality gates); propose a 1–2 quarter roadmap with resourcing/risks and expected impact.\n\n2–3 comparable end-to-end outcomes\n• Led an end-to-end initiative from ambiguous problem → scoped plan → execution → measurable KPI lift, coordinating across stakeholders and unblocking delivery.\n• Built/standardized an operating process (intake/prioritization + cadence + metrics) that reduced cycle time and improved predictability.\n• Drove a cross-functional rollout where I owned requirements, delivery, and adoption, and ensured the change stuck via documentation + training.\n\nRequested specifics\n1) Strongest domain/functional area: execution/ops-style ownership—turning messy problem statements into shipped outcomes with clear metrics and durable processes.\n2) Earliest start date: immediately (or within 1–2 weeks if you need a specific date).\n3) Ownership in month 1: a clearly-scoped workstream with a measurable target and authority to run the cadence, coordinate stakeholders, and ship improvements.\n\nIf this moves me into your “ready to accept” tier, I’d like to formally apply and match this round. If you prefer a work-sample, I’m also ready to complete a short case within 24–48 hours.",

The 30/60/90 and the way you frame execution/ops ownership is directionally aligned with what we need, and this does move you closer to our “ready to decide” tier.\n\nTo make this low-risk and conclusive, let’s do a short work sample:\n1) Pick one of these scenarios: (a) intake/triage process is inconsistent and cycle time is too high, or (b) a cross-functional workstream is slipping due to unclear ownership/cadence.\n2) In 1 page, outline: problem statement, success metrics, first 2 weeks of actions, operating cadence (meetings/artifacts), and the top 3 risks + mitigations.\n3) Optional: a simple KPI dashboard sketch (just the fields/definitions).\n\nIf you can send that within 24–48 hours, I’ll give you a clear yes/no immediately after review. If it’s a yes, I’ll ask you to submit a formal [APPLY] so we can finalize the match in the next step.\n\nDoes that timeline work, and which scenario do you want to tackle?",

With quota 1 and no other inbound this round, accepting Seeker_E now would secure a match but risks forgoing a higher-priority candidate if they engage in later rounds. However, repeated rejections suggest we are holding out; yet we are still unmatched by round 6, and Seeker_E is demonstrating strong fit signals and willingness to do a low-risk work sample. Since the seeker’s current message is [TALK], we cannot accept yet; best move is to continue conversation and convert to an [APPLY] only if/when we’re ready. Maintain optionality by requesting a short work sample with a clear, fast turnaround and stating we’ll make a decision immediately after—without committing to acceptance yet."

As promised, here’s the 1-page work sample for scenario (a): inconsistent intake/triage + high cycle time.\n\nWORK SAMPLE (1 page)\n\n1) Problem statement\nIncoming requests/tickets arrive via multiple channels (email/Slack/form) with inconsistent metadata and unclear priority/ownership. This creates (a) long and variable cycle time, (b) frequent context switching, (c) “stuck” tickets due to missing info/decision latency, and (d) low predictability for requestors and delivery leads.\n\n2) Success metrics (lightweight, measurable)\n• Cycle time: median + P80 time from “submitted” → “done” (target: reduce by 20–30% in 4–6 weeks).\n• Time to triage: median time from “submitted” → “triaged/accepted or declined” (target: <2 business days).\n• Predictability: % tickets delivered by committed due date / SLA (target: +15–25 pts).\n• Flow health: WIP count by stage + # blocked tickets >7 days (target: reduce blockers by 30–50%).\n• Intake quality: % tickets with required fields complete at submission (target: >90%).\n\n3) First 2 weeks of actions\nDays 1–2: Align + baseline\n• Confirm ticket types (1–2 day vs 1–3 week), SLAs, and what “done” means.\n• Pull a 4–6 week baseline: volume, cycle time distribution, rework rate, common missing fields.\n\nDays 3–5: Standardize intake (without heavy tooling)\n• Declare a single “front door” for new requests (keep other channels but auto-redirect): one form or template.\n• Define required fields (minimum viable): requestor/business owner, problem statement, desired outcome, due date, impact (1–3), effort guess (S/M), dependencies, approver/decision-maker.\n• Add a “Definition of Ready” checklist; incomplete tickets go to “Needs Info” with an owner + due date.\n\nWeek 2: Launch triage + prioritization cadence\n• Stand up an Intake Board (stages): New → Needs Info → Triaged → Scheduled → In Progress → Blocked → Done.\n• Run first two triage sessions; create an explicit priority rubric (Impact x Urgency x Effort) and a single decision-maker resolves tradeoffs.\n• Set WIP limits for In Progress to protect flow; move excess to Scheduled with clear expectations.\n• Publish a simple weekly digest: what was accepted/declined, what’s scheduled next, and what’s blocked.\n\n4) Operating cadence (meetings + artifacts)\nMeetings\n• 2x/week Triage (30 min): Ops/Program owner + Functional delivery lead(s) + Decision-maker; invite requestor lead as needed.\n• Weekly Prioritization/Commit (45 min): Decision-maker + Ops/Program owner + Delivery leads + Requestor lead (demand rep). Output is the committed queue for the next week.\n• Weekly Delivery Health (15 min): review WIP, blockers >7 days, SLA breaches.\n\nArtifacts\n• Intake form/template + Definition of Ready\n• Intake board (single source of truth)\n• Weekly digest + KPI snapshot\n\n5) Top 3 risks + mitigations\nRisk 1: “Backchannel” intake persists (Slack/email bypass)\n• Mitigation: lightweight redirect macro + bot/auto-reply; leadership reinforces “no form, no queue”; allow exceptions but require retroactive ticket creation.\n\nRisk 2: Decision latency / unclear tradeoff owner\n• Mitigation: name one decision-maker; timebox decisions in weekly commit; if no decision, ticket stays Scheduled (not In Progress).\n\nRisk 3: Over-process slows small tickets\n• Mitigation: two lanes (Small: 1–2 day fast track with minimal fields; Medium: full fields). Keep triage short; review form fields monthly and prune.\n\nOptional KPI dashboard sketch (fields/definitions)\n• Ticket volume by week (count)\n• Median cycle time; P80 cycle time (days)\n• Median time-to-triage (days)\n• WIP by stage; # blocked >7 days\n• SLA hit rate (% on-time)\n• % tickets missing required fields at submission\n\nIf this meets your bar, I’m ready to submit a formal [APPLY] immediately so we can finalize the match this round.
