Seeker_A ranks Company_B #4, less likely but still possible if earlier options fail.

Thus the probability of receiving Seeker_C or Seeker_B soon is low, while Seeker_D is an immediate, high-commit candidate and #3 on our list.

Confirming: if you decide to move forward with me this round, I’m fully committed to Company_A as my destination and I’m ready to proceed immediately.\n\nI do not have any competing offers or deadlines over the next 48 hours that would affect timing. I can start within 1 week, and if you give the word I can submit a formal [APPLY] right away so we can move to an [ACCEPT] quickly.\n\nThank you again for the transparency—happy to move fast if needed.",

Company_A has asked me to confirm commitment and competing deadlines so they can move quickly if their higher-priority pipeline falls through. I should respond promptly, confirm exclusive commitment if they move forward, and indicate no competing deadlines, while reiterating readiness to submit a formal APPLY immediately upon request."

Seeker_A/C have already been rejected; Seeker_B and Seeker_D (higher priority) have not engaged with Company_A historically and, given their preferences, are more likely to match elsewhere (Seeker_B prefers Company_B and Company_D over Company_A; Seeker_D prefers Company_C over Company_A). At round 12 with quota 1 and only Seeker_E in the inbox showing strong commitment and no competing deadlines, waiting further risks ending unmatched. Best move is to convert Seeker_E to a formal application so we can accept quickly this round if no higher-priority candidate appears."

However, in the current round the only inbound is Seeker_E, and we have been signaling readiness to proceed if they submitted a formal [APPLY]. Prior rejects were due to holding out for higher-priority pipeline, but at round 13 with quota 1 and no evidence Seeker_B or Seeker_D are available/engaging Company_A, rejecting risks ending unmatched or being forced later into a worse outcome. Accepting Seeker_E now secures a match with an included candidate and closes the position."
