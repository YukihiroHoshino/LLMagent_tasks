Defined success metrics, aligned stakeholders on scope, shipped in 3 weeks, and improved cycle time by ~25% while reducing handoff errors by ~15%.\n\n• Operating cadence / predictable delivery: Established a weekly cross-functional operating rhythm (clear DRIs, risk log, escalation path, and milestone burndown). On the next program, delivery predictability improved (missed milestones down from ~30% to <10%) and stakeholder escalations dropped materially.\n\n• Ambiguous problem → measurable outcome: Took ownership of a vague “quality is slipping” signal by instrumenting key checkpoints, running a root-cause review with Eng/Support, and shipping targeted fixes + guardrails. Result: ~20% reduction in repeat issues over the following month.\n\nEarliest start date: 2 weeks from offer (can discuss faster if needed). Preferred role focus: ownership of a core workflow/product area with close cross-functional execution and measurable outcomes.\n\nIf helpful, I’m happy to send a 1-page write-up of one of these projects (scope, tradeoffs, metrics) or jump on a quick call to walk through how I’d approach your first 60–90 day priorities.",
