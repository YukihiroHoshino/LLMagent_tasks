However, Seeker_D (our top) prefers Company_C then Company_A then Company_B, and Company_D/Company_A rank Seeker_D highly, so Seeker_D is likely to be taken early elsewhere; Seeker_A ranks us 4th, so unlikely to apply soon. Waiting could risk ending up with a lower-ranked candidate or unfilled seat if top choices never come. Given the one-seat quota and Seeker_B’s strong interest, accept now to lock in a high-quality, stable match rather than gamble for a higher-ranked but unlikely-to-land candidate."
