Set the plan, weekly cadence, risk log, and comms; drove requirements alignment and cutover. Timeline: ~6 weeks from kickoff to launch. Outcome: on-time launch, reduced handoff delays and rework (measured by fewer escalations and faster cycle time in the first month post-launch).\n• Process + KPI stabilization: Took ownership of a slipping recurring deliverable with unclear ownership (reporting + follow-ups across multiple teams). Rebuilt the operating rhythm (RACI, SLAs, templates), automated the most manual steps, and instituted a weekly review. Timeline: ~4 weeks to stabilize. Outcome: deliverables consistently on time and stakeholders had a single source of truth for status/next actions.\n\n2) Functions I’m strongest in\nProgram/Project Management, Ops/Process, stakeholder coordination, execution tracking, and analytics-adjacent work (defining metrics, building lightweight reporting, turning insights into action).\n\n3) Best lane at Company_E\nExecution-focused Program/Operations role (program manager / biz ops / internal ops) where I can own cross-functional delivery, keep timelines tight, and unblock teams. I’m flexible on domain/team, but that’s where I’ll add value fastest.\n\nGiven this, do you think it’s worth me submitting another formal [APPLY] this round, or are you still holding the seat for profiles that are a tighter match to the immediate priorities?",
