I’m ready to start immediately and own this end-to-end with minimal ramp.\n\n**Goal (first 4–6 weeks):** measurably improve quality + throughput by instrumenting the workflow, eliminating top recurring failure modes, and standardizing execution.\n\n## 0–7 days: Diagnose + instrument\n- **Map the workflow** (intake → execution → review → release) and define “done.”\n- **Baseline metrics (daily dashboard):** cycle time (p50/p90), WIP, reopen/rollback rate, defect escape rate, on-time delivery %, and top 5 causes of rework.\n- **Triage taxonomy:** tag every issue/rework by root cause (requirements gap, handoff, test gap, tooling, ownership ambiguity).\n- **Operating cadence:** 15-min daily execution standup + 2x/week quality review (top defects + prevention actions).\n\n## 8–21 days: Stop the bleeding (highest-leverage fixes)\n- **Top-3 rework killers:** pick the 3 biggest drivers of reopen/defects and implement targeted preventions (checklists, templates, gating criteria, automated checks where possible).\n- **WIP limits + pull-based flow:** enforce explicit WIP caps to reduce context switching and improve predictability.\n- **Definition of Ready/Done:** lightweight gates so work doesn’t enter execution without minimum clarity; work doesn’t ship without agreed acceptance.\n\n## 22–45 days: Standardize + scale\n- **Standard playbooks:** repeatable SOPs for common work types (intake, execution, review, release).\n- **Quality bar enforcement:** pre-release review checklist + post-release retro loop (single owner for follow-ups).\n- **Continuous improvement loop:** weekly “top 5” review of metrics + actions; retire what’s fixed, add what’s new.\n\n## Measurable targets (first 4–6 weeks)\n- **Cycle time:** improve p90 by 20–30%.\n- **Reopen / rework rate:** reduce by 25%.\n- **Defect escape / rollback:** reduce by 15–25%.\n- **On-time delivery:** +10–15 pts (absolute), depending on baseline.\n\n## Two ownership examples mapped to this lane\n1) Took over a struggling workstream with high rework: instrumented causes, introduced DoR/DoD + review gates, standardized handoffs; delivered a clear reduction in rework and faster turnaround.\n2) Owned end-to-end delivery of a time-sensitive project: set success metrics, enforced execution cadence, managed tradeoffs, and shipped on schedule with launch readiness owned by me.\n\nIf this lane is still open, I’d like to formally re-apply and be evaluated against this specific scope. If the answer is no due to priority order, I’d appreciate a clear final decision so I can plan accordingly. Thank you.\n\n[APPLY]",

In the current round, Seeker_E is not applying, only confirming disengagement.
