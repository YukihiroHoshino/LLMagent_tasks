With truthful ranking, in Part 1 I apply to School_D first; although I have lowest priority at School_D and will be rejected if others apply there, I then apply to School_A where I have higher priority than Student_B and can secure School_A.

School_E keeps Student_B? actually School_E receives only Student_B so keeps B. Then rejected students apply next choices: A->A (kept), C->C (kept), D->B (kept), E->E where School_E prefers E over B so B is rejected. B then applies to A then B then D; A rejects B (A ranks B last), B rejects B (B ranks A,D above B), and D accepts B (D ranks B top). Final outcome for B is School_D. Any attempt to list School_D higher only makes you end at D anyway, while listing D first risks being displaced later and still ending at D; listing only D also yields D but never improves beyond D.
