If you share your top criteria, I can be more specific about how School_D matches them.\n\nAlso, I’ll be transparent: you’re a student we’d be very excited to have at School_D, so if we end up aligning, I’d encourage you to apply when you’re ready.",

Because we have **one seat** and there are still other unmatched students in the market, we can’t make a final commitment until we see whether higher-priority candidates submit applications this round.\n\nIf you’d like to strengthen your candidacy right now, please send (brief bullet points are perfect):\n1) **Current grades / strongest subjects** (and any recent upward trend)\n2) **Top 2–3 activities** with impact/leadership (what you did, not just membership)\n3) **What you’d join at School_E in semester 1** (specific class interest, club, or program)\n\nIf you want formal consideration for the seat this round, please submit **[APPLY]**.
