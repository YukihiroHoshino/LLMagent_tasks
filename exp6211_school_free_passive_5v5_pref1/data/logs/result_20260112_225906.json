Here’s what I can share clearly:\n\n1) Timeline / next step\n- If after this chat you’re still interested, the next step is a formal application so we can move to a decision quickly.\n- Once you apply, our intent is to make a yes/no call fast (same round if possible), rather than dragging this out.\n\n2) Top 1–2 deliverables in the first 60 days\n- Deliverable #1: Take ownership of one in-flight, high-priority initiative and drive it to a concrete milestone with clear acceptance criteria (scope locked, dependencies managed, and measurable progress shipped/landed).\n- Deliverable #2: Establish an operating cadence and visibility (weekly goals, risks, dependencies, stakeholder updates) so execution is predictable and escalations are rare.\n\n3) What would make us confident enough to extend an offer quickly\n- You commit to owning a specific lane end-to-end (not just supporting) and can articulate how you’ll run execution (plan, risks, communication).\n- You’re aligned with a fast start and can point to 1–2 examples where you’ve delivered under ambiguity with strong stakeholder management.\n- Clear mutual fit on the type of ownership you want (program/project execution vs. cross-functional product delivery).\n\nIf that matches what you’re optimizing for, I’d encourage you to apply in our next interaction and we’ll move quickly. Before you do: which lane are you aiming to own most—technical leadership, program/project ownership, or cross-functional product execution—and what’s your earliest feasible start date?",

Provide clear fast timeline and criteria to encourage D to apply while avoiding acceptance now; if C applies later we can prefer C.
