Many students find it easy to get involved quickly because club leadership actively recruits new members.\n\nSupport: Advising is a big strength—academic advising plus wellbeing support, with early interventions if grades slip.

We run early progress monitoring and targeted tutoring/office hours so small slips don’t become big problems. If you like clear expectations and steady feedback, you’ll feel supported.\n\n3) **Extracurriculars with real ownership:** Clubs are student-led with faculty mentorship.

You’ll see a lot of peer tutoring and club-based mentorship.\n\n4) Who thrives at School_E\n- Students who like a balance of challenge + support.\n- Students who want to improve steadily with coaching and feedback.\n- Students who want a community where it’s normal to ask for help and also normal to take on leadership (clubs, service, projects).\n\nTo help you decide whether to apply this round: what are the top 2–3 things you’re optimizing for (e.g., strongest academics, a specific extracurricular area, competitive environment, individualized support, college guidance, etc.)—and what’s one thing you definitely want to avoid in a school?
