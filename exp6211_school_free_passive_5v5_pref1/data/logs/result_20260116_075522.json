Based on what you’ve shared about your consistency, organization, and interest in contributing to our community, we believe you’ll be a strong fit for School_D’s first-year seminar and early-access programs.\n\nWe’re happy to offer you our seat. Welcome to School_D—if you accept, we’ll follow up with next steps for onboarding and course/activity selection.",

Student_A and Student_B are already matched elsewhere, leaving Student_C as the highest-ranked available student. Student_D is available but ranked lower than Student_C; Student_E is lowest. Since Student_C is applying now, accepting secures our best feasible outcome and avoids the risk of ending unmatched or settling for a lower-priority student later."
