You’d also write a short “here’s what I learned + what I’d improve next” note to align on priorities.\n- **By 60 days (end-to-end ownership of a feature/initiative):** take a well-defined problem from requirements → design proposal → implementation → testing/rollout. We expect you to drive the plan, surface tradeoffs, and coordinate with PM/design/QA as needed.\n- **By 90 days (become the go-to owner for a slice):** you’re the primary owner for a component/workflow area—able to handle on-call issues (if applicable), make iterative improvements, and propose the next roadmap step with measurable impact.\n\n**How we evaluate success (signals we actually use):**\n- **Deliverables shipped:** did it reach production, and is it maintainable (tests, docs/runbooks where relevant)?\n- **Outcome metrics:** depends on the project (e.g., latency/error rate, funnel conversion, time-to-complete, support tickets, internal cycle time). We set a baseline early and define “what good looks like” before building.\n- **Stakeholder feedback:** PM/design/partners: were you proactive, clear on status/risks, and good at incorporating feedback?\n- **Execution quality:** good scoping, sensible tradeoffs, and predictable follow-through.\n\n**Mentorship in practice (cadence + mechanisms):**\n- **Manager 1:1 weekly** (goals, feedback, growth).\n- **Onboarding buddy** for day-to-day questions in the first 4–6 weeks.\n- **Code reviews are standard** and we aim for quick turnaround; for larger changes we’ll do a short pre-implementation design review.\n- **Pairing is available** (especially early or for tricky areas), but we don’t force constant pairing—more “use it when it accelerates learning.”\n- **Fast feedback loops:** small PRs, frequent merges, and short check-ins with stakeholders so you’re not waiting weeks to validate direction.\n\nTo make sure we’re aligned on “clear ownership”: what type of ownership are you aiming for most—**feature area ownership**, **service/component ownership**, or **customer-facing/problem-triage ownership**?

It’s meaningful because it touches production behavior quickly and has clear before/after metrics.\n\n**What you’d do in weeks 1–2:**\n- Get full context on the workflow, current pain points, and constraints.\n- Pull data: error/failure patterns, latency hotspots, top user-reported issues.\n- Propose a focused plan (usually 2–3 concrete fixes + instrumentation) with success metrics.\n\n**Weeks 3–8 (ownership + delivery):**\n- Drive the fixes end-to-end: design approach, implementation, rollout plan, and post-launch validation.\n- Establish or improve dashboards/alerts/runbooks so the improvements stick.\n\n**Autonomy level (scope, decisions, stakeholder access):**\n- **Scope:** you’d own a clearly defined slice (we’ll align on boundaries in week 1), but you’ll have latitude to adjust the plan as you learn—so long as you keep the success metrics intact.\n- **Decision-making:** you can make day-to-day technical decisions independently; for larger design tradeoffs we do a quick review (short doc or walkthrough) to unblock fast rather than gatekeep.\n- **Stakeholder access:** direct access to PM and any key partners from day one; you won’t have to route everything through your manager.\n\nIf this sounds aligned, I’m happy to move quickly.
