If a student is struggling in a class, we prioritize early intervention (teacher office hours, peer tutoring, and targeted study plans).\n\nStudent life: Clubs are a big part of our culture—academic teams, arts, service/volunteer groups, and interest-based clubs. We also encourage students to start new clubs if they have a clear plan and a faculty sponsor.\n\nWho thrives here: Students who do best at School_D tend to be curious, consistent, and willing to ask for help early.

We look forward to supporting you academically and helping you get involved from day one. [ACCEPT]",

Student_C ranks School_E last and has only been talking, so unlikely to apply/commit. Student_E ranks us first and is applying now, offering a guaranteed fill. Accepting now secures a match; waiting for a higher-ranked student is impossible since A/B/D are already matched elsewhere and C unlikely. Therefore accept Student_E."
