My best shot is Company_E, but I’m not paired with them this round. To avoid wasting the round, I should keep Company_D as a fallback by expressing interest and learning their timeline/criteria, without committing an application that will likely be rejected if they receive stronger applicants."

Start date is flexible for the right fit, but sooner is better.\n\nTo calibrate fit: what role/function are you targeting, and what are 1–2 recent projects where you delivered results fast? Also, what’s your earliest realistic start date?",

You’ll also meet key partners (product, design, stakeholders) and get clarity on how we plan and ship.\n- **Weeks 3–8 (first ownership area):** You take ownership of a well-scoped project with real user impact (e.g., improving a workflow, shipping a feature slice, or hardening a service/process). You’ll write the proposal/plan, execute, and present results.\n- **Months 3–6 (bigger scope + autonomy):** Scope expands to a multi-sprint initiative or a small “pod-level” ownership area. Expect to drive tradeoffs, coordinate with cross-functional partners, and set measurable success criteria.\n\n**Mentorship + support:**\n- You’ll have a dedicated onboarding buddy for day-to-day questions.\n- A primary mentor/manager with weekly 1:1s focused on growth, feedback, and unblocking.\n- Regular design/peer reviews so you get high-signal feedback early, not just at the end.\n\n**How success is evaluated:**\n- **Delivery & impact:** Did you ship what we planned, and can we point to a measurable outcome (quality, performance, user metrics, cycle time, etc.)?\n- **Ownership:** Are you proactively identifying risks, clarifying requirements, and driving decisions?\n- **Collaboration:** Clear communication, good handoffs, and effective cross-functional work.\n- **Craft/quality:** Maintainable work, testing/validation, and thoughtful tradeoffs.\n\nTo make this more concrete: what kind of ownership are you aiming for (feature delivery, platform/infrastructure, data/analytics, customer-facing work), and what does “strong learning” mean to you (new domain, new tech stack, leadership, etc.)?

That includes clarifying requirements, proposing the plan, executing, and communicating progress/risks.\n- **Days 30–60 (measurable impact):** deliver a larger milestone or second project that moves a metric (quality, performance, reliability, cycle time, or a customer-facing outcome), and demonstrate strong ownership: good tradeoffs, clean handoffs, and predictable execution.\n\n**Hiring timeline / decision speed**\nWe’re aiming to move quickly: once someone applies, we typically complete interviews in **~1–2 weeks** and can make a decision shortly after (often **within a few days** of the final conversation).
