That will help me tell you whether School_E is likely to be a strong match for what you want.",

Students who like structured problem-solving tend to do very well.\n- **Humanities & writing track:** strong reading/writing seminar style classes with frequent feedback and revision cycles—good preparation for competitive admissions essays and interviews.\n- **Student-led capstone / leadership opportunities:** many students take on a substantial club or community project by mid–upper grades with a faculty advisor; it’s one of the ways students here build a distinctive profile.\n\n**Support for competitive universities**\n- **Advising cadence:** regular guidance check-ins (not just when there’s a problem), with course planning and goal-setting each term.\n- **Academic support:** teacher office hours, targeted tutoring/study sessions when needed, and early progress monitoring so gaps don’t compound.\n- **Mentorship:** students can be paired with a faculty mentor (and often an older-student peer mentor) for planning, habits, and accountability.\n\n**Joining clubs/teams & finding community (first semester)**\n- New students typically integrate quickly because clubs are active and student-led. We run an early-semester **activities fair** and a “try-it period” where students can attend multiple clubs before committing.\n- Teams/clubs generally welcome beginners; for more competitive teams, we’ll be transparent about tryouts and still help students find a good-fit alternative community.\n\nTo tailor this: what are your top academic interests (STEM vs humanities vs arts), and are you aiming for a highly structured support system or more independence?
