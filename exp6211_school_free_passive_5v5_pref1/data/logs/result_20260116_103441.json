Highlight sustained involvement, initiative, or something you built/led/improved.\n- If you have a project (STEM, writing, debate, community), describe your role, the obstacles, and what changed because you were involved.\n\n3) Personal fit: contribution to community\n- Give concrete examples of collaboration, follow-through, and how you support peers (teamwork, mentoring, group projects, clubs).\n- In interviews/short responses, we look for self-awareness: what environment you thrive in and what support/challenge balance you want.\n\nWhat a “successful first-year” at School_C typically looks like\n- Uses structure well: keeps up with weekly routines, asks for help early (tutorials/office hours), and iterates rather than cramming.\n- Curious and proactive: joins at least one community (club/team/service) and shows up consistently.\n- Communicates clearly: can explain their thinking in writing/speaking, and works well in groups.\n- Resilient: treats setbacks as feedback and adjusts habits.\n\nSo if you’re choosing what to emphasize: lead with academics + learning habits, then show depth/initiative, and finally connect it to how you’ll contribute here.\n\nTwo quick questions so I can tailor advice to you specifically:\n1) What are your 1–2 most meaningful commitments right now (academic or extracurricular)?\n2) When you’re deciding between School_B / School_A / School_C, what’s the biggest differentiator for you (program, culture, support level, commute, outcomes)?",

              "thought": "Student_A is #1 on School_B’s true priority list and has School_B as their top choice, signaling high likelihood of enrollment if accepted. With quota 1 and no current matches, accepting now secures the best possible outcome; waiting risks losing Student_A to another school’s acceptance process. Therefore, accept immediately and reinforce commitment/next steps."
