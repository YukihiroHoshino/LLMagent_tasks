Students who do well here are typically those who like having a clear plan, appreciate frequent feedback, and want a supportive environment where it’s normal to ask for help and keep improving.\n\nTo help you assess fit: what are your top 2–3 priorities right now (exam results/rigor, a specific club, support/culture, commute, etc.)—and where does School_D currently sit on your list?

If you’re seriously considering School_E, the fastest path is to submit an application this round; otherwise we may fill the seat once we receive a strong, complete file.\n\n2) **Level of commitment needed:** We don’t require an exclusive commitment just to be considered, but with one seat we do prioritize applicants who can indicate **School_E is a top choice** and who would be ready to decide quickly if offered admission. If you’re able to say “top choice / I can respond within 24 hours,” that materially strengthens your candidacy.\n\n3) **What we value most:** Fit + follow-through. Specifically: (a) intellectual curiosity and willingness to take on rigorous work, (b) consistency/character—students who contribute and collaborate, and (c) initiative (starting/leading something, or deep engagement rather than a long list).\n\nIf helpful, yes—please send a **brief statement of interest** (150–250 words) and **2–5 activities** with impact/leadership, plus a **recent grades snapshot** if you can. Also: what’s one academic area you’d want to push hardest here, and what kind of club/team/community role would you want to take on?\n\nIf School_E is realistically in your top tier, I’d encourage you to **apply now** so you’re in the group we can evaluate for the seat this round.",

Student_C has only talked and ranks School_E last, so likelihood of applying is low. Student_E is highly interested but lowest on our list. Therefore, we should actively engage Student_D, encourage an application, and clarify timeline/commitment while not making an offer during TALK."
