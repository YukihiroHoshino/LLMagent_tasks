If someone starts slipping, we intervene early with a plan rather than waiting for grades to drop.\n2) Academic support that’s built into the week: Teacher office hours and peer tutoring are scheduled and easy to access, and we’re proactive about helping students build study systems (planning, revision habits, test prep). Students who use these supports early tend to feel much less stressed.\n\nWho tends to be most successful and happy here:\n- Students who like a rigorous environment but want it to feel supportive and organized.\n- Students who communicate and ask for help early (we respond quickly, but it works best when students engage).\n- Students who enjoy going deep in 1–2 interests (clubs, competitions, arts/athletics, service) rather than trying to do everything at once.\n\nTo help you compare your “higher-fit options” with School_E: what are the top 2 factors you’re optimizing for (e.g., strongest STEM/debate pathway, most supportive advising, specific clubs, campus culture)?

So while I can’t promise the seat will remain open beyond this round, I also won’t pressure you to apply if we’re not a serious option.\n\nIf School_D is a realistic choice for you (even as a strong backup), the safest way to keep the option open is to apply as soon as you feel you could commit if accepted.\n\nTo help you plan responsibly: where does School_D currently sit on your list, and what are the top 2–3 factors driving your decision (academics, support level, clubs, commute, etc.)?",
