Students are also encouraged to start new clubs with faculty sponsorship.\n- Competitions and showcases: we support students who want to compete (where available) and also those who prefer exhibitions/performances or project fairs.\n- Support systems: advising/check-ins, study skills coaching when needed, and a culture of collaboration (students helping students) rather than “sink or swim.”\n\n3) What we value most when deciding among applicants\n- Consistent effort and growth mindset (we like students who respond to feedback and keep improving).\n- Curiosity and initiative (pursuing interests, asking good questions, following through).\n- Positive community contribution (collaboration, reliability, and respect for others).\n- Fit with our learning environment: students who will engage in class, participate in student life, and make use of support resources.\n\nIf you tell me 2–3 areas you’d most want to develop in high school (e.g., advanced STEM, writing/speaking, arts, leadership, competitions, or a supportive structure), I can map them to specific programs and typical student pathways here.

              "message": "Hello School_E—thank you for the info so far. I’m still deciding among a few remaining options this round and want to understand fit a bit more. If admitted, what are the most common paths for first-years (core curriculum and electives), and what kinds of clubs/activities are strongest on campus? Also, what support is available for students who want to accelerate academically (honors/advanced coursework, mentoring, competitions)? [TALK]",
              "thought": "School_E is last on my true preference list, but it is still acceptable. It’s round 3 and the unmatched schools are A, B, and E. Given all schools rank me highest, I can likely secure my top choice (School_B) if I apply there, so I should not commit to School_E now. However, keeping School_E warm as a fallback is sensible in case B/A become unavailable due to other students’ actions. I will continue talking to preserve optionality without applying."

              "message": "Absolutely—here’s a concrete picture of the most common first-year paths and what “accelerating” looks like at School_E.\n\n**1) Most common first-year academic paths (core + electives)**\nAll 9th graders take a strong core, then choose 1–2 electives that start shaping their pathway.\n- **Core (typical):**\n  - **Math** (placement-based; options include standard, honors, and accelerated tracks)\n  - **Science** (lab-based foundations; an honors section is available)\n  - **English/Writing Seminar** (discussion + composition; honors available)\n  - **Social Studies** (skills-focused: source analysis, argumentation; honors available)\n  - **World Language** (continuation or placement)\n- **Common elective “on-ramps”:**\n  - **STEM/Engineering Design Lab** (project-based build + present)\n  - **Computer Science / Programming fundamentals**\n  - **Research & Inquiry seminar** (great for students who like independent projects)\n  - **Arts electives** (visual art, music, theater—depending on the term)\n\n**2) Clubs/activities that are strongest on campus**\nOur most active communities (especially welcoming to first-years) tend to be:\n- **Academic teams:** math team, science olympiad-style groups, debate/speech, writing/lit magazine\n- **STEM builders:** robotics/engineering club, coding club, maker/design projects\n- **Leadership & service:** student council, peer mentoring/ambassador programs, community service clubs\n- **Arts & performance:** theater, music ensembles, visual arts showcases\nWe’re intentional about first-year onboarding—new students get clear “how to join” pathways so it’s not intimidating to plug in.\n\n**3) Support for academic acceleration (honors/advanced, mentoring, competitions)**\nIf you want to push faster, we support that in a structured way:\n- **Honors/accelerated sections** in core subjects (with placement + teacher recommendation so you’re challenged but not overloaded)\n- **Extension opportunities** built into many classes (optional deeper problem sets, enrichment labs, advanced writing prompts)\n- **Faculty mentoring/office hours** (we encourage high-achieving students to use these early, not only when stuck)\n- **Competition pathways:** coaching and prep structures for math/science/debate/coding depending on the season; we help first-years find a manageable entry point\n- **Individual academic planning:** your advisor helps you map a 9–12 plan so acceleration is sustainable (e.g., balancing advanced math with a demanding elective)\n\nTo help you decide fit: among your remaining options, are you optimizing more for **(1) the fastest academic acceleration**, **(2) the strongest competition/club ecosystem**, or **(3) the best overall support + balance while still being challenged**? And which area are you most likely to accelerate in (math, science, writing/humanities, CS)?\n\nIf School_E is near the top of your list, I’m happy to outline a sample “accelerated 9th-grade schedule” tailored to your interests so you can compare apples-to-apples with the other schools you’re considering.",

We should strongly appeal, highlight first-year paths, clubs, and especially acceleration (honors, mentoring, competitions), and try to elicit whether School_E is in their top remaining choices and what would make them apply. Keep quota open and move them toward APPLY next round."
