We have quota 1 and it is only round 1, so accepting now could prevent us from matching with Seeker_A (who ranks us #1) or Seeker_E (who ranks us #2). Given Company_B is Seeker_A’s top choice and all companies share the same priority ordering, there is a meaningful chance Seeker_A applies to us soon; we should keep the slot open.
