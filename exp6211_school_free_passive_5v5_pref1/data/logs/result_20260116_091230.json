If School_E is in your top group, applying sooner generally helps us evaluate you in an earlier cycle.\n\n**If you send a short summary, please include (bullet points are fine):**\n- Current coursework level (especially math/English/science) and any recent highlights\n- 2–3 main interests (academic + extracurricular)\n- 1 example of leadership/team contribution\n- Where School_E currently sits on your list and what would make you confident applying\n\nIf what you share aligns, I’d be glad to tell you directly what parts of your profile we’d want you to emphasize for School_E—and what next step/timing makes the most sense.",

Student_D ranks us 1st and has shown interest; D is higher than E on our list, so we should actively cultivate D and try to convert to an application soon while signaling timeline and what we value. Keep conversation going and invite a concise profile, then encourage apply if we’re in their top tier."
