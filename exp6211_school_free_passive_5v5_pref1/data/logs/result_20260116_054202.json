We also support students aiming for advanced work through honors/extension options where appropriate.\n\n2) Student support (structured, proactive)\n- Built-in advising/check-ins so students aren’t left to “figure it out” alone.\n- Office hours and targeted tutoring/study-skills support are easy to access, especially during transition periods or when a course gets challenging.\n\n3) Signature pathways/program feel\n- We emphasize practical skill-building: writing clearly, presenting, collaborating, and planning long-term projects.\n- Many students find a “home base” through an advisory + one or two clubs/teams, which helps both academically and socially.\n\nWhat we prioritize in incoming students\n- Curiosity and follow-through (doing the work consistently, not just cramming)\n- Willingness to ask for help and use feedback\n- Positive contribution to the community (reliable teammate/classmate)\n\nWho thrives at School_D\n- Students who want structure, like measurable progress, and are open to coaching.\n- Students who want both academic focus and a supportive environment rather than a sink-or-swim culture.\n\nTo tailor this to you: what subjects or activities are you most excited about (STEM, humanities, arts, leadership/service, athletics), and what kind of classroom environment helps you thrive (fast-paced, discussion-heavy, more guided/structured, project-based)?
