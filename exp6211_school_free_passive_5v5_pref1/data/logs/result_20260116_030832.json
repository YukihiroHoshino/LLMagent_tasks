With limited seats, we can’t “reserve” a spot while you explore, but if School_D becomes one of your top choices, applying sooner helps ensure you’re considered while capacity is still available.\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing, what are the other schools you’re prioritizing right now, and what are you looking for (academics, activities, support, culture) so I can tell you specifically how School_D fits?",

Students tend to form tight cohorts; we value responsibility and community contribution over “competitive for competition’s sake.”\n\n**What we prioritize in applicants**\n- **Academic readiness** (solid fundamentals and willingness to be challenged)\n- **Consistent effort over time** (reliability, follow-through)\n- **Positive community impact** (collaboration, curiosity, integrity)\n\n**Fit + timeline guidance**\nBecause seats are limited, we can’t hold spots while students explore.

At round 5, only School_A and School_E remain unmatched, meaning School_E likely rejected me (they rank me last and had higher-priority applicants). To avoid ending unmatched, I should now apply to School_A. Given School_A also ranks me last, I need to signal strong commitment to increase acceptance chances, but since there are no other schools left for me to pursue, applying now is optimal."

With quota 1 and only Student_D and Student_E unmatched, we should consider whether holding out could yield Student_D (ranked higher). However, Student_D has not applied and may prioritize School_D over us, while Student_E is applying with a credible commitment to enroll and withdraw elsewhere. Accepting now secures a match rather than risking an unfilled seat by waiting. Given the market uncertainty and the student’s stated commitment, accept."
