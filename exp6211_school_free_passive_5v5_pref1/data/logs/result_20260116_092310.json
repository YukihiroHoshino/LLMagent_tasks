Students often tell us the difference is that expectations are high, but you’re not left alone to figure everything out.\n\n(2) What a successful first-year at School_C typically does\nCourses / academics:\n- Takes a balanced but challenging load: strong performance in core subjects first, then adds an advanced/extension course once routines are solid.\n- Uses the system early: attends office hours/tutoring proactively (not only after a bad test), keeps a planner, and responds to feedback quickly.\n- Builds strong fundamentals: consistent homework completion, frequent review, and practice tests—steady habits beat last-minute cramming here.\n\nClubs / student life:\n- Commits to 1–2 activities with consistency (academic club, arts, service, sports—any is fine). We value sustained contribution over joining many clubs briefly.\n- Looks for one “anchor community” (team/club/cohort) plus one exploratory interest.\n\nExpectations / mindset:\n- Reliable attendance, respectful collaboration, and willingness to ask for help.\n- Sets a term goal (grade target or skill target) and meets with their advisor to track progress.\n\nTo tailor this to you: are you aiming for the most accelerated academic track possible, or a strong track with balance?

However, since I’m currently paired with School_A and it remains unmatched, there’s a chance A/B haven’t applied here yet (or are pursuing other top choices). Applying now could secure School_A if they are willing to accept before higher-priority applicants arrive; waiting risks losing the seat.
