Key signals we look for:\n- Recent projects where you drove measurable outcomes (e.g., shipped a feature/process, improved a metric, reduced cycle time/cost)\n- Comfort operating with ambiguity and turning it into a plan (milestones, risks, tradeoffs)\n- Strong collaboration: crisp written updates, expectation-setting, and proactive unblocking\n\nWhat “success in the first 3 months” looks like:\n- Weeks 1–2: ramp on our product/workflows, meet key partners, understand priorities; deliver a small quick win\n- Weeks 3–6: take ownership of a defined workstream/project; produce a clear plan and start execution\n- Weeks 7–12: deliver a meaningful milestone to production/business use, with documented learnings and a follow-on roadmap\n\nTo tailor this: what’s one project you’re most proud of recently, and what was the impact + your specific role?
