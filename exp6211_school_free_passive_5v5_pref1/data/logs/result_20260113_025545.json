If you’re available, ~3–6 weeks is great, but we can accommodate later starts (including 8–12 weeks) for the right fit.\n\n3) What makes someone stand out in the first 90 days:\n- Ownership + execution: you take a defined problem area and ship a measurable improvement (quality, speed, reliability, or user impact).\n- Strong problem framing: you turn ambiguity into clear milestones, risks, and tradeoffs.\n- Communication: crisp written updates, proactive alignment with partners, and predictable delivery.\n\nYes—please send the 2–3 bullet summary of your most relevant experience (projects with scope + measurable outcomes if possible).
