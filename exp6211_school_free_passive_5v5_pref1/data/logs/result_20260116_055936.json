We’re glad School_A is on your shortlist.\n\nWhat we value most in applicants:\n- Consistent academic effort and curiosity (we like students who ask questions and use feedback)\n- Reliability and positive community impact (how you collaborate, support peers, and follow through)\n- Clear interests (even if you’re still exploring) and willingness to grow\n\nStudent experience (academics/support):\n- Strong core academics with structured support (regular check-ins, office hours/tutorial time, and targeted help when a student hits a tough unit)\n- Teachers emphasize clear expectations and steady progress; students who engage early tend to thrive\n- Advising focuses on goal-setting, course planning, and balancing workload\n\nClubs & activities:\n- A wide range of student-led clubs (academic teams, arts, service, and interest-based groups), and it’s common for students to start new clubs with a faculty sponsor\n- Lots of opportunities to take leadership roles after you’ve tried a few activities\n\nTo help you decide whether to apply to School_A this round: what areas are you most excited about (STEM, humanities, arts, sports, service), and what kind of support or environment helps you do your best? Also, how are you weighing School_A versus your top choice right now?",

Although Student_D is 4th on our true priority list, accepting now secures a guaranteed match within our quota and avoids the risk of remaining unmatched if higher-priority students never apply to us (they generally rank other schools above School_D).
