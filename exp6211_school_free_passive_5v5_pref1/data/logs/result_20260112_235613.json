If selected, I’d focus my first 60–90 days on understanding your highest-impact priorities, aligning with stakeholders, and delivering measurable progress on the key initiatives you’re hiring for. I’d love to be considered for your open role. [APPLY]",

Top choices Company_C and Company_B are presumably already matched by now (not in remaining list), so Company_A is now my best available option. Given all companies share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I am behind Seeker_A and Seeker_B everywhere, so I should apply now to secure a match before Company_A fills with a higher-priority seeker. No prior interaction with Company_A, so a concise, value-forward application is best."

Our top choices Seeker_A and Seeker_B are still unmatched but not in this round; however, with only 30 rounds and random pairings, waiting risks ending unmatched. Seeker_C has applied directly and is acceptable. Also, Seeker_C ranks Company_A third, but may accept Company_C or Company_B if offered; securing them now avoids losing them. Given quota 1 and no current match, accept to lock in a solid candidate rather than gamble on encountering Seeker_A/B later."

We’ll follow up immediately with the written details and next-step logistics (start date, compensation, and onboarding plan). Welcome aboard.",
              "thought": "As Company_E, my true priority is Seeker_A > Seeker_B > Seeker_C > Seeker_D > Seeker_E. Seeker_E is on my list but last. However, Seeker_E ranks Company_E as their #1, so accepting secures a match immediately. Given remaining unmatched seekers are C, D, E and my quota is 1, waiting for C or D is risky because they prefer other companies (Company_E is last for both), so they are unlikely to apply/commit. Therefore, accepting Seeker_E maximizes the chance of filling the role with an acceptable candidate rather than ending unmatched."
