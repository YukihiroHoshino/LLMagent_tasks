However, Seeker_C has Company_C as their top choice and is applying now, meaning high acceptance likelihood and reduced risk of losing the round. With only 1 quota and no current matches, accepting Seeker_C secures a solid match rather than holding out for Seeker_A/Seeker_B who may match elsewhere (Seeker_A prefers Company_B/Company_A first; Seeker_B prefers Company_A first). Therefore accept Seeker_C."

We’re excited to move forward with you.\n\nTo align on the first 90 days, our top priorities are: (1) take ownership of a core workstream end-to-end with high-quality, on-time delivery, (2) communicate progress/risks crisply with cross-functional partners, and (3) demonstrate strong judgment under ambiguity by proposing options and driving to decisions.\n\nIf you’re able, please reply with two quick items: (a) a recent example where you ramped fast in a new domain and delivered within ~60–90 days, and (b) the kind of scope you’re aiming for (IC execution vs. leading a broader project). We’ll use that to kick off next steps immediately.\n\n[ACTION] [ACCEPT]",

Although Seeker_A is #1 for Company_A, Seeker_A’s top choice is Company_B, so waiting risks ending unmatched or settling for a lower choice. Accepting Seeker_B now maximizes expected outcome within quota."

However, they are applying now and list Company_E as their #1, making acceptance highly likely to secure a match this round.
