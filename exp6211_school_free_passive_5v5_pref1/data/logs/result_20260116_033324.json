Students have a designated counselor for academic planning and well-being check-ins, plus support for study habits, course selection, and goal-setting. We also offer tutoring/peer support and targeted help for students who want to strengthen specific subjects.\n\nClubs & community: There’s a wide range of clubs (academic teams, arts, service/volunteering, and interest-based groups). If you tell me what you’re into—STEM, arts, leadership, sports, community service—I can point you to the most relevant options.\n\nTo help you compare schools: what are your top 2–3 priorities (e.g., advanced academics, supportive counseling, specific clubs, school culture, commute)? Also, which subjects do you most want to challenge yourself in?\n\nWe’d be excited to see an application from you when you’re ready—if you apply in a later round, I’ll be glad to continue the conversation and make sure you have what you need to decide.",

I’m applying because I believe I’d be a strong fit for your academic expectations and student community, and I’m eager to contribute through consistent effort, collaboration, and involvement in school life. If accepted, I’m prepared to commit promptly and complete any next steps right away. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "School_D is 4th on my true list (C, B, A, D, E). At round 5, only School_B and School_D remain unmatched, meaning School_C/School_A/School_E are already taken, so I cannot reach my top 3 anymore. Given all schools share the same priority order (A > B > C > D > E), I’m mid-priority; delaying risks losing School_D if another student applies and is higher priority. Since School_D is still acceptable and on my list, I should apply now to secure a match rather than risk ending unmatched."

If you have any constraints (timing, course interests, support needs), tell us now so we can plan your first-term schedule and counselor onboarding.\n\nWelcome to School_D—we’re excited to have you join our community.

Student_C is applying now and expresses readiness to commit promptly. Since accepting C secures a higher-priority match and all schools share the same priority ordering, there’s no advantage in delaying; we should accept immediately to lock in the better outcome."
