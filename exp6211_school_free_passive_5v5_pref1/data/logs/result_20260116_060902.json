These are offered at multiple levels so you can enter at the right pace (standard → honors/accelerated where appropriate).\n- Structured support: Every first-year is placed in a small advising group that meets regularly—this is where we set goals, monitor workload, and make sure you’re challenged without getting overwhelmed.\n- Electives/exploration: You typically choose 1–2 electives in your first year (depending on course level), with common choices including Computer Science, additional language/advanced language, arts (music/visual/media), and applied STEM electives. We encourage students to try at least one “new-to-you” area.\n\n(2) Signature opportunities students most often take advantage of\n- Signature Project/Research Track: Students can join a guided project pathway (often starting with a skills seminar) that leads to a mentored research or capstone-style project. Many students present at our internal showcase and then move into external competitions.\n- Competition & Club Ecosystem (student-driven): Strong participation in STEM/academic teams (e.g., math/science/robotics-style competitions) and leadership-friendly clubs—students can propose new clubs early, and we provide a faculty sponsor + a clear process to get it running.\n- Community internships/service placements (selective): For students who are ready, we help connect them to short-term placements tied to interests (education, local government, labs/tech, community orgs), typically after they’ve settled into the academic routine.\n\nTo make this concrete for you: what are you most excited to pursue in year 1—advanced coursework (which subjects), a particular club/competition area, or a research/project path? And what would you need to see from School_C for it to move ahead of School_A/School_B?\n\nWe have very limited seats, so if School_C is close to the top, I’d encourage you to apply when you feel ready and we can seriously consider you right away.",
