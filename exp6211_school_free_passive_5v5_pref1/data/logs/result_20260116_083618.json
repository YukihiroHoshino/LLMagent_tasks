Students who do well here tend to be curious, consistent, and comfortable asking for help early.\n\nStudent support: We place a big focus on guidance and planning—regular check-ins with advisors, structured academic support (office hours/tutoring), and course-planning help so students can balance challenge with wellbeing.\n\nClubs & community: We encourage students to build a “home base” through clubs (academic, arts, service, and interest-based). Many students find leadership opportunities quickly because we actively support student-led initiatives.\n\nTo help me tailor details: what areas are you most focused on right now (e.g., STEM, humanities, arts, leadership/service), and what kind of support matters most to you (academic coaching, mentoring, enrichment)?

Student_C does not rank us highly (School_E is last), so the chance they would commit is low. With one seat and only two unmatched students, we should keep Student_C engaged but avoid signaling a likely offer unless they can credibly commit; otherwise we risk losing the seat or ending with a low-yield match. Best move: respond with selection criteria, avoid promising the seat, and ask for a clear commitment plus concrete updates; encourage an application only if we are a top choice."
