The goal is to establish an operating cadence and deliver a clear launch/milestone by ~day 90.\n\n2) How success is measured\nWe measure success with a mix of **outcomes + execution quality**:\n- **Outcome metric(s)** tied to the project (examples: error rate/reliability, cycle time/throughput, conversion/activation, customer support contact rate, or NPS/CSAT movement for a specific journey).\n- **Delivery milestones**: clear PRD/spec, stakeholder alignment, on-time shipment of an agreed MVP, and a post-launch iteration plan.\n- **Operating rigor**: cadence (weekly updates), risk management, and decision clarity (tradeoffs documented, scope controlled).\n\n3) Team structure + closest partners\n- You’d sit in a **cross-functional pod** with a dedicated **Engineering lead**, **Product partner**, and close collaboration with **Design/Research** (as needed), plus stakeholders in **Data/Analytics** and **Ops/Customer** depending on the initiative.\n- Day-to-day, you’d partner most closely with **Product + Engineering**, and you’d also drive alignment with any dependent teams (platform, infra, or downstream business owners).\n- You’d have a direct manager who’s accountable for the broader program area and can unblock quickly.\n\nIf you’re open to it, I can tailor the above to the exact area we’d likely place you in—what are you prioritizing right now (0→1 vs scaling, customer-facing vs platform), and what’s your decision timeline?
