              "message": "Student_D—thanks for being direct about where you are in the process. Here’s what committing to School_E typically looks like for a student focused on steady improvement:\n\n**(1) Typical first-year academic track + support (steady-improvement path)**\n- **First 4–6 weeks: baseline + routine**: teachers and your advisor help you set a weekly study plan (time blocks, assignment tracking, test-prep cadence). We identify 1–2 “highest-leverage” skills to build first (e.g., algebra fluency, reading annotation, writing structure).\n- **Ongoing: predictable feedback cycles**: you’ll get frequent check-ins on assessments and assignments, with clear “next steps” (what to practice, how often, and what mastery looks like). We emphasize consistency over cramming.\n- **Built-in extra-help**: you’re not left to figure out support on your own—extra-help/tutoring time is planned into the week so it’s easy to use early, before gaps widen.\n\n**(2) Advising/tutoring structure (who meets with you, how often)**\n- **Advisor**: you have a dedicated advisor who meets with you **regularly (typically weekly early on, then at least biweekly as you stabilize)** to review grades, workload, and goals.\n- **Subject teachers**: scheduled office hours/extra-help blocks for targeted questions and skill practice.\n- **Tutoring/peer support**: if a pattern shows up (e.g., repeated quiz misses or incomplete homework), we match you with **targeted tutoring** focused on the exact skill gap, not generic homework help.\n- **Coordination**: advisor + teachers coordinate so you’re not getting conflicting guidance; the goal is one coherent plan.\n\n**(3) Qualities that make students most successful at School_E**\n- **Consistency** (showing up, doing the reps, using a calendar)\n- **Early help-seeking** (asking before you’re behind)\n- **Responsiveness to feedback** (willing to revise, adjust strategies)\n- **Community mindset** (reliable teammate/classmate; collaborative rather than competitive)\n\nIf you’re comfortable sharing: what are the “couple higher-ranked options” you’re waiting on, and what’s your decision timeline? If School_E becomes your best available option, we can move quickly—if you reach that point, I’d encourage you to submit an **[APPLY]** so we can seriously consider locking in a seat for you.",

E already applied and was rejected; A is top priority but may be hard to attract since School_E is last on A’s preference list. D ranks School_E last as well but is still engaging; if we can convert D to apply, we secure a mid-priority match rather than risk ending empty. Since D is on our list (4th), we should actively appeal while keeping the door open and prompting a near-term apply decision."
