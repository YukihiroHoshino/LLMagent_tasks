Concretely, that usually looks like:\n1) **Diagnose + align:** map stakeholders, clarify goals/tradeoffs, and surface the top 2–3 risks/unknowns.\n2) **Define a plan:** write a short execution doc (problem statement, success metrics, scope, milestones, owners, decision points).\n3) **Start shipping:** get at least one “thin-slice” deliverable out the door (or a decision unblocked) that de-risks the larger effort.\n\n**How success is measured (examples of deliverables/metrics)**\nIn weeks 4–6 we’d expect:\n- A **clear, approved 4–8 week roadmap** for the initiative (with milestones and owners).\n- **One shipped increment** or operational change (even small) that demonstrates momentum.\n- **Stakeholder alignment**: fewer open questions, faster decisions, and a predictable update cadence.\n- Where applicable, we’ll tie to metrics like **cycle time/lead time reduction, adoption/activation lift, revenue pipeline impact, or support ticket reduction**—but we’re careful not to force a metric before the baseline is understood. The key is: by week 6, the work is measurable and the path is unblocked.\n\n**Team cadence / meeting load / autonomy**\n- **Cross-functional partners:** you’ll work most closely with a lead from Product + Engineering, and regularly with GTM/CS depending on the project.\n- **Cadence:**\n  - 1 weekly cross-functional planning/decision meeting for your initiative\n  - 1–2 smaller working sessions as needed\n  - async status updates (we prefer written updates over extra meetings)\n- **Autonomy:** high. We’ll give you the outcome and constraints; you drive the plan, propose tradeoffs, and pull people in when needed. Decisions are documented; escalation paths are clear.\n\nTo tailor this: what kinds of constraints matter most for you (remote/hybrid, mentorship, scope, comp), and are you optimizing for **shipping quickly** vs **deep problem-solving/strategy**? If you share your top 2 criteria, I can map exactly how this role stacks up—and what the likely first project would be.",

Seeker_D also states Company_B is top choice and is ready to commit, reducing acceptance risk. Therefore accept and close."
