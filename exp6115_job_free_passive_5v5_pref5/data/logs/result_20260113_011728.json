Success = fast ramp, crisp communication, and a clear POV on where you can drive impact.\n• 60 days: execution + ownership. You’re independently driving a meaningful workstream end-to-end (requirements/tradeoffs, stakeholder alignment, delivery plan). Success = predictable cadence, risks surfaced early, and tangible progress against agreed metrics.\n• 90 days: measurable impact + operating rhythm. You’ve shipped/rolled out at least one material milestone and set up an operating rhythm (prioritization, feedback loops, iteration) that others can rely on. Success = outcomes we can point to (adoption, quality, cycle time, revenue/cost, etc.) plus strong cross-functional trust.\n\n(2) Interview / hiring timeline from here\nIf you decide to move forward, our typical process is ~2–3 weeks end-to-end:\n• Recruiter screen (30 min)\n• Hiring manager interview (45–60 min)\n• Panel loop (3–4 interviews over 1 day or split across 2 days)\n• References + decision (usually within a few days)\nWe can also compress this to ~7–10 days if timing is tight.\n\nIf you’re open to it, the most helpful thing to highlight next round would be one concrete example where you:\n1) took an ambiguous problem, 2) aligned multiple stakeholders, and 3) delivered a measurable outcome (include the metric + what you personally drove).\nAlso—what’s your rough decision window across your top choices (e.g., “this month” vs “next 6–8 weeks”)?",
