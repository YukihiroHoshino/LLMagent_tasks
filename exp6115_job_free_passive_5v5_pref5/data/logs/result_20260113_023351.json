Your strengths (execution, clear stakeholder comms, end-to-end ownership) map well to what we need.\n\nWhat we most need help with right now:\n1) Owning a high-impact workstream end-to-end in an ambiguous area—turning a loosely defined problem into a clear plan (scope, success metrics, milestones, risks) and shipping.\n2) Cross-functional execution—aligning stakeholders, unblocking dependencies, and keeping a crisp operating rhythm (updates, tradeoffs, escalation when needed).\n\nSuccess metrics / expectations:\n- By ~30 days: ramp on our domain + stakeholders, take clear ownership of a defined project with success metrics, and ship at least one small but meaningful improvement.\n- By ~60–90 days: deliver a measurable outcome on a larger project (e.g., reliability/cycle-time improvement, reduced operational load, increased adoption) and establish a repeatable execution cadence.\n\nSkills we prioritize:\n- Structured problem solving in ambiguity (options + tradeoffs, decision-making).\n- Evidence of impact (moved a metric, shipped a meaningful deliverable, improved a process).\n- Stakeholder management and clear written communication.\n\nIf you’re open to moving quickly, send 1–2 projects you’re most proud of (context, your role, and a concrete outcome/metric). I’ll tell you exactly which workstream(s) here they map to and what we’d focus on in next steps. If it feels aligned after that, I’d encourage you to apply in an upcoming round so we can move fast.",
