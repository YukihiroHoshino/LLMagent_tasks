The immediate work is:\n1) **Clarify scope + success metrics** with key stakeholders (align on what we will/won’t do in this phase).\n2) **Build a delivery plan** (milestones, dependencies, risks, decision points).\n3) **Drive execution on the first milestone**—usually a “thin-slice” deliverable that unblocks dependent teams.\n\n**How we measure success (deliverables/metrics):**\n- **By end of week 1:** stakeholder map + written problem statement, proposed scope, and draft success metrics; list of top risks/dependencies.\n- **By end of week 2:** agreed execution plan (milestones + owners), operating cadence in place, and at least one key decision unblocked.\n- **By weeks 3–4:** first milestone shipped (or in production rollout), with a clear readout: what changed, impact, and what’s next.\n- Metrics depend on the exact workstream, but typically include **cycle time reduced**, **fewer escalations/rework**, **on-time milestone attainment**, and **a measurable improvement to a core KPI** tied to the initiative.\n\n**Working style / cadence / autonomy:**\n- **High autonomy with explicit checkpoints:** you’ll own the plan and day-to-day decisions; we do quick escalation when tradeoffs affect other teams.\n- **Cadence:** a short weekly cross-functional sync (20–30 min), plus an async written update 1–2x/week (status, risks, asks). Ad-hoc working sessions as needed during critical moments.\n- **Stakeholder exposure:** direct access to partner leads; you’ll be the primary point person driving alignment.\n\nTo tailor this precisely: what type of environment do you do your best work in—more structured with predefined milestones, or more ambiguous where you define the plan from scratch?

Company_D’s priority list ranks me 3rd (behind Seeker_D and Seeker_A). Those seekers prefer B/C first, so they may already be matched, making my acceptance chances at D reasonable. I’ve only talked with D once and haven’t applied yet; to maximize my outcome, I should apply now and signal strong commitment and readiness."

However, there is no guarantee we will be paired with them again soon, and they may match elsewhere (they both rank Company_D last, so they’re unlikely to apply here). Seeker_C ranks Company_D 3rd and is proactively applying, making this a strong, realistic match. Accept to lock in a top-3 choice rather than gamble and potentially end unfilled."

Company_A is still available and is ranked above E for me, but I don’t know if I’ll get A given Company_A’s priority list (E > D > A > B > C) and Seeker_E likely pursuing A/C/D. Company_E ranks me last in their priorities, so an immediate apply risks rejection and provides little leverage.

The profile leading is still execution/ownership-first (turn ambiguity into a written plan, align stakeholders quickly, and ship a first slice fast). Strong stakeholder coordination is a plus when it directly accelerates delivery, but we’re weighting “can independently drive to a measurable outcome” most heavily.\n\nIf you can share a concise 30/60/90-day plan tailored to the first 3–4 week deliverable (the execution plan + kickoff + early win), please include:\n1) The specific problem you’d pick up first and the success metric you’d anchor on\n2) Your week-by-week milestones for the first 4 weeks (including the “first slice” you’d ship)\n3) Stakeholder map + cadence and how you’d handle scope/risk\n4) What data you’d pull in weeks 1–2 to validate direction\n\nAlso, quick calibration: what’s the strongest example you have of delivering an early win in a new environment within ~30 days, and what was the measurable impact?",
