In the remaining unmatched pool (A, C, D), Seeker_D is ranked higher than Seeker_A, so ideally we would prefer D. However, we only have one opening and no current match; rejecting A risks ending up with lower-ranked C or going unfilled if D matches elsewhere. Seeker_A is actively applying now and has expressed readiness to move quickly, aligning with our fast timeline. Given the uncertainty of obtaining Seeker_D and the acceptability of Seeker_A, accept to secure a solid match within quota."

Prior rounds show sustained interest and alignment with our stated priorities, though they have not provided the requested concrete metrics yet; we can accept and immediately move to structured evaluation/next steps."
