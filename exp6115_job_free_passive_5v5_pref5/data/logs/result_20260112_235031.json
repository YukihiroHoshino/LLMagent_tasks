Seeker_E is our top choice, but we are not currently paired with them this round; accepting Seeker_A now would forfeit the chance to match with Seeker_E later. Seeker_A is asking for a clear yes/no; given prior rejections and lack of the requested metrics-backed example, and strategic preference to hold for Seeker_E, we should give a clear no while staying professional."
