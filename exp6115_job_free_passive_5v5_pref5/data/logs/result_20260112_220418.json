Our immediate needs this cycle center on getting a key set of deliverables shipped and building reliable operating cadence.\n\nTop priorities for the first 90 days:\n1) First 2 weeks: ramp quickly—understand our product/workflows, meet cross-functional partners, and take ownership of a clearly-scoped starter project.\n2) By day 30: independently drive a core workstream end-to-end (requirements → execution → validation), with crisp weekly updates and risk management.\n3) By day 60: deliver a meaningful milestone that improves quality/speed (e.g., reducing cycle time, improving reliability, or unblocking a partner team).\n4) By day 90: establish repeatable process—metrics, documentation, and a plan for the next quarter that we can align on together.\n\nWhat tends to make someone successful here is strong ownership, clear communication, and comfort prioritizing under ambiguity.\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of role are you optimizing for right now (scope, team size, tech/functional focus), and what are your top 2 criteria when choosing between companies? If there’s a fit, I’d love to move quickly to an application and next-step conversation.",
