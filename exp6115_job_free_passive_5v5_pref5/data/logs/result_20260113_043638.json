You’d drive requirements, execution, and rollout with clear metrics.\n- **Project 2 (Weeks 4–8):** Lead a cross-functional initiative where you align stakeholders, define success metrics, and deliver a measurable improvement (often involves prioritization tradeoffs and stakeholder management).\n- **Project 3 (Weeks 8–12):** Own an end-to-end initiative with a small roadmap (discovery → plan → execution → launch), and establish a repeatable cadence (dashboards/metrics, documentation, operating rhythm).\n\n2) **What success looks like by Day 90:**\n- You’ve **delivered 1–2 meaningful wins** with measurable impact (quality, cycle time, customer impact, or operational reliability—depending on the workstream).\n- You’ve **taken clear ownership** of a recurring area (a metric, a workflow, or a program) and stakeholders know you as the “go-to.”\n- You’re running independently: crisp updates, clear prioritization, and proactive risk/issue management.\n\n3) **Interview/decision timeline:**\n- If you’re ready, we can **move quickly**—typically **1 week** from application to final decision (sometimes faster depending on scheduling).\n- Process is usually: **recruiter screen → hiring manager conversation → focused panel (2–3 interviews) → decision**.\n\n**Most prioritized skill area:** the biggest differentiator is the ability to **drive ambiguous, cross-functional work to a concrete outcome** (strong problem framing + prioritization + execution + stakeholder alignment).\n\nIf you share 1–2 examples of (a) an ambiguous project you led end-to-end and (b) how you measured impact, I can map them directly to the projects above. And if you’re still feeling aligned, I’d encourage you to **apply this round** so we can get you into the fast-track interview schedule.",

We cannot accept without an APPLY, so continue dialogue and invite application with a concrete next step."
