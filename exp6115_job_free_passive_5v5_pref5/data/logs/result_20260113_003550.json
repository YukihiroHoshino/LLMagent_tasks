I’m prioritizing roles where I can contribute immediately, collaborate cross-functionally, and grow with the team; Company_C is one of my top targets this cycle. If selected, I’m ready to move quickly on next steps and commit to the process. Thank you for considering my application.",
              "thought": "Company_C is my #2 choice (very high), so I should apply immediately rather than risk losing the slot. Company_C’s priority list ranks me 3rd (behind Seeker_B and Seeker_C).

              "thought": "Seeker_D is 3rd on Company_C’s true priority list (B, C, D, E, A), so they are a strong candidate and acceptable to fill our single quota. Although Seeker_D’s own preferences rank Company_B above Company_C, they are still applying now and signaling willingness to move quickly; waiting for Seeker_B or Seeker_C is risky because they may match with their higher-preference companies (A/B) and Company_C could be left without a top candidate.

Given our quota is 1 and Seeker_B ranks Company_B as their #2 (after Company_A), there is some risk they could match with Company_A if we delay, but accepting now secures a very high-priority candidate.
