Here’s what we’re optimizing for and how we’re thinking about timing.\n\n#1 business problem for the first 60–90 days:\nOwn an ambiguous, cross-functional initiative that removes a key execution bottleneck and delivers a measurable outcome (e.g., improving a core workflow/throughput metric, reducing cycle time, or shipping a v1 of a high-impact capability). The main thing is end-to-end ownership: clear scope, alignment, execution, and visible impact.\n\nTop skills/experiences we’re prioritizing most:\n1) Proven end-to-end ownership in ambiguous space (you’ve set direction, made tradeoffs, and shipped).\n2) Strong stakeholder management and communication (aligning partners early, keeping work unblocked, crisp updates).\n3) Execution fundamentals (prioritization, operating cadence, reliability; bias toward shipping and iterating).\n\nTimeline:\nWe’re moving quickly. If there’s strong alignment, we can complete remaining conversations in ~1 week and be in a position to make a decision shortly after (it’s possible we get to offer-level this week depending on scheduling).\n\nIf you send the concise mapping you mentioned (2–3 bullets tied to the three priorities above, plus one concrete example with impact), I’ll confirm fit and propose immediate next steps to keep momentum.",
