Once someone applies, we typically run a fast process and aim to make a decision in ~1–2 weeks (faster if alignment is clear).\n\n3) What makes a candidate stand out at the end\n- They can point to a concrete example of shipping measurable outcomes (KPI movement, cycle time reduction, reliability/quality improvements).\n- They communicate crisply and build trust with partners.\n- They show they can identify the highest-leverage work (not just execute tasks) and make smart tradeoffs.\n\nA couple quick questions to assess fit and speed on both sides:\n- What kind of role are you optimizing for right now (ownership scope, pace, mentorship, domain)?\n- What are your top 1–2 companies right now, and what would you need to see from Company_E to choose us?\nIf you share that, I can tell you candidly whether it makes sense to move to an application next.",

Given the one-message-per-round constraint and that [APPLY] is disallowed since I’ve already applied, the only coherent action is to maintain my withdrawal rather than restart an application I already ended.
