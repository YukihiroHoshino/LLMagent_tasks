However, Seeker_B ranks Company_A as #1 and is applying now, making acceptance likely to secure a match immediately. Holding out for Seeker_E/Seeker_D/Seeker_A is risky because they may prefer other companies (E prefers C/D/A; D prefers B/C/A; A prefers B/C/A). Given uncertainty in random pairing and the value of locking a willing top-choice candidate, accept Seeker_B."
