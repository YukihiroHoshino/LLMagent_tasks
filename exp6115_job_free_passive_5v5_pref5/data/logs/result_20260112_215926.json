For this role, the first 60–90 days are focused on getting to impact quickly in three areas:\n\n1) First 2–3 weeks: ramp + clarity\n- Learn our workflow, stakeholders, and current bottlenecks\n- Take ownership of one well-scoped, high-visibility project and produce a concrete plan with milestones\n\n2) Days 30–60: execution + measurable wins\n- Deliver that first project to completion (or a meaningful milestone) with clear metrics (quality, time-to-deliver, reliability, customer/internal satisfaction)\n- Improve one process that reduces cycle time or rework (e.g., better prioritization, documentation, handoffs)\n\n3) Days 60–90: scale + ownership\n- Independently drive a second initiative with cross-functional coordination\n- Propose a roadmap of next-quarter opportunities based on what you’ve learned\n\nSkills we value most:\n- Strong ownership and follow-through (turning ambiguity into a plan and results)\n- Clear communication with stakeholders (especially tradeoffs and timelines)\n- Analytical problem-solving and comfort using data to make decisions\n- Collaboration and pragmatic execution\n\nTo tailor this: what kind of role are you optimizing for right now (scope, growth, team style), and what’s an example of a “quick impact” you’ve made in your first 1–2 months somewhere?",
