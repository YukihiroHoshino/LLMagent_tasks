From a formal application, we aim to move through screens/interviews in **~1–2 weeks**, and make a decision shortly after final interviews (often **within a few days**).\n\nTo tailor this: what’s your strongest area among (a) leading ambiguous projects, (b) cross-functional stakeholder work, and (c) shipping measurable outcomes? And what’s your availability to start?\n\nIf this aligns, I’d encourage you to submit an application so we can get you into the process quickly.",
