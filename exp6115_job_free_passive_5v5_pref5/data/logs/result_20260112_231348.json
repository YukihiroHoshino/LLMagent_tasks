It’s early (round 1) and I still have realistic shots at higher choices (Company_B/Company_C/Company_A), so I should not commit yet.

After a strong conversation, we’re prepared to invite a final-step chat immediately and extend an offer as soon as we’ve confirmed mutual fit (typically within the next 1–2 rounds of this process).\n\nIf you’re open to it, I’d love to hear what kind of work you’re targeting next and what environment helps you do your best work—so I can be concrete about fit and impact here.",
