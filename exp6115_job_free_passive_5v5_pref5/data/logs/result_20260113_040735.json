Here’s what we’re prioritizing most in this hire and what “standing out” looks like.\n\n**Top outcomes in the first 60–90 days**\n1) **Deliver a real, measurable win**: take ownership of a scoped project, align stakeholders, and ship an improvement (speed, quality, reliability, cost—depends on area) within ~6–8 weeks, then iterate.\n2) **Create clarity + operating rhythm**: turn ambiguity into a plan (milestones, risks, decision points) and establish a lightweight cadence with cross-functional partners so execution is predictable.\n3) **Be a trusted owner**: by ~90 days, you’re the person others rely on to unblock decisions and follow through.\n\n**Top skills we screen for**\n- **Structured problem-solving + execution** (can go from messy inputs → crisp plan → shipped output)\n- **Stakeholder management** (written clarity, good tradeoffs, calm under pressure)\n- **Ownership mindset** (proactive, raises risks early, closes loops)\n\n**What makes a candidate stand out in our process**\n- Concrete examples of **end-to-end ownership** with metrics (what changed because of you)\n- A clear approach to **ambiguity** (how you decide what to do first, and what you won’t do)\n- Evidence you can **influence without authority** (alignment, tradeoffs, decision-making)\n\nIf you’re ready to move quickly, I’m open to that. Two quick questions so I can assess fit and—if it’s aligned—encourage you to apply:\n1) What’s one project you’ve owned end-to-end that’s most similar to the kind of 60–90 day win above (what was the metric/result)?\n2) What type of work are you optimizing for right now (0→1 build, scaling/ops, customer-facing, strategy)?\n\nIf your answers line up, I’ll tell you directly and we can proceed promptly.",
              "thought": "Seeker_C is #3 on Company_D’s true priority list (after Seeker_D and Seeker_A), so they are a strong target. Seeker_C also ranks Company_D 3rd, making a match plausible if I differentiate quickly and invite an apply. However, Seeker_D is my #1 and currently engaged; I should keep momentum with Seeker_C without committing the slot until they signal readiness. Since they sent [TALK], I respond with [TALK], answer clearly, and prompt them to apply if aligned, while lightly qualifying fit to preserve optionality."
