You’d own the scope, success metrics, execution plan, and weekly stakeholder cadence, and you’d ship at least one meaningful iteration within the quarter.\n- Operational/quality improvement: Identify a recurring friction point (process/tooling/analytics visibility) and drive a measurable improvement—typically something that reduces cycle time, improves reliability, or makes decision-making faster via better instrumentation and reporting.\n\n2) How we evaluate performance (first 60–90 days)\n- Clarity + execution: Are you translating ambiguity into a concrete plan with milestones, owners, and measurable outcomes?\n- Delivery + impact: Are you shipping increments on schedule and moving the agreed metric(s), even if via iterative releases?\n- Communication: Proactive updates, crisp risk management, and alignment with partners—no surprises.\n- Ownership: Do you independently unblock yourself/others and make sound tradeoffs when constraints change?\n\n3) Collaboration style\n- High autonomy with strong support: We’ll align on outcomes and constraints up front; you’ll have room to choose the “how,” with regular check-ins to remove blockers.\n- Cross-functional touchpoints: Typically a weekly XFN sync for the project, plus lightweight async updates (short written status, decision logs). You’ll work closely with product/engineering and at least one other function depending on the initiative.\n\nIf those themes match what you’re optimizing for, I’d be excited to move quickly—if you’re ready, the best next step is to apply and I’ll prioritize getting you through the process promptly.
