I can start quickly and bring strong execution/ownership; if helpful I can send a 3–4 bullet fit summary immediately. If you’re ready to decide this round, I’d be excited to move forward with you.

Company_E is 4th on my list (above Company_B and unemployment if only these remain). I have only talked so far and not applied; applying now is appropriate. Company_E’s priority ranks me 4th, but other higher-priority seekers likely matched already, making acceptance more likely. I should signal commitment and concise fit, and ask for decision this round."

We’ll use that to align on your first 60–90 day priorities and get the process finalized quickly.",

Seeker_E is on our true priority list (4th of 5), and leaving the role unfilled is worse than hiring someone on-list given the market is effectively ending.
