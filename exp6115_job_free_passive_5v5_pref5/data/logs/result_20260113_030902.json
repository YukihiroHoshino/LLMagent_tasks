Deliver at least one tangible early win (e.g., unblock a dependency, clarify scope, or close a key gap).\n- 60 days: run the cadence independently (weekly status, decision log, risk burndown), resolve 1–2 major cross-team blockers, and show measurable improvement in predictability (on-time milestones, fewer escalations).\n- 90 days: land the major milestone (or drive a high-quality go/no-go), and leave behind a repeatable playbook others can use.\n\nSkills/traits that differentiate top performers on our team:\n- High ownership + judgment: you proactively surface tradeoffs early and don’t wait for perfect info.\n- Crisp cross-functional communication: you can align strong opinions, document decisions, and keep teams moving.\n- Structured execution: you translate ambiguity into a plan with milestones, risks, and measurable outcomes.\n- Calm under pressure: you de-escalate and unblock rather than amplify noise.\n\nTo make sure I’m answering in the most relevant way: what kind of work do you want most right now (0→1 launch vs. scaling/ops vs. process redesign), and what would you need to see from Company_D for us to move up your shortlist?
