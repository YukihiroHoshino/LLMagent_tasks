I’m able to move quickly and can take end-to-end ownership of ambiguous work while keeping stakeholders aligned with clear, proactive communication.\n\nIf there’s a fit, I’m ready to commit and start immediately. Are you in a position to make a decision this round? If you share the top 1–2 must-haves you’re prioritizing, I’ll respond with a concise set of directly relevant examples right away.",
              "thought": "Company_D is my last-choice among acceptable options, but remaining unmatched is worse than taking D if B/C/A/E are unavailable. At round 6, unmatched companies are B, D, E; I’ve already applied to E and strongly pursued B without response. Company_D’s top priority is Seeker_D, so I have a strong chance to secure a match if I apply now. To maximize my outcome, I should first probe lightly whether D can decide immediately and keep the door open to B/E, but since I have not applied to D yet and D is likely to accept quickly, applying now reduces risk of ending unmatched if B/E fill. Therefore: apply to Company_D with a clear, fast-commitment pitch and ask for a decision this round."

Yes, we’re in a position to make a decision this round, and based on what you’ve shared, we’d like to move forward.\n\nOur top must-haves are: (1) proven end-to-end ownership in ambiguous, cross-functional work that leads to a shipped outcome, and (2) crisp stakeholder communication with a strong execution cadence (clear milestones, risks surfaced early, measurable results).\n\nIf you’re ready to commit and start immediately as noted, we’re aligned—let’s confirm start date and any constraints, and we’ll coordinate next steps right away.",
