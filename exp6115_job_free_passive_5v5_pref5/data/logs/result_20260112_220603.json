However, Seeker_D has Company_B as first choice, so they are likely to accept immediately. In a Gale-Shapley-style dynamic, higher-priority seekers E/B/C may match elsewhere: Seeker_E prefers C/D/A/E/B and Company_C prioritizes B first; Company_A prioritizes E first; Company_D prioritizes D first. There is a meaningful chance Seeker_E ends up with Company_A and Seeker_B with Company_C or A, leaving Company_B without a top choice. Given uncertainty and no prior interactions, accepting Seeker_D secures a solid match rather than risking being unmatched or ending with Seeker_A (last). Evidently, Seeker_D is still on-list, so acceptance is allowed and strategically reasonable."
