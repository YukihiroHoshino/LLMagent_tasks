Although Parent_E is applying and would accept immediately, accepting now would lock in the worst-ranked match and foreclose the possibility of matching with any higher-priority parent (A–D) who could still apply in later rounds. Given no expiration/round limit pressure is specified beyond round 30 and we can continue holding the seat open, the optimal strategy to maximize priority is to continue rejecting Parent_E until either a higher-priority parent applies (then accept them) or we near the end and must decide whether to fill with E. In round 17, it is still too early to concede; therefore reject again while keeping door open for later rounds."

              "thought": "Nursery_E’s true priority ranks Parent_E last (A>B>C>D>E). However, only Parent_E is applying in round 18 and we have remained unmatched through many rounds. In this environment, holding out for higher-priority parents is only beneficial if they are likely to apply to Nursery_E, but Parents A–D all rank Nursery_E last in their preferences, so they are unlikely to ever apply unless all other options fail. With quota 1 and no other applicants in the inbox, accepting Parent_E now secures a match rather than risking ending unmatched by round 30. Although this sacrifices priority optimality, it is the best achievable outcome given revealed demand for Nursery_E."
