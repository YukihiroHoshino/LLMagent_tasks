Given parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parent_B ranks E 4th, Parent_C ranks E last, Parent_D ranks E last, and Parent_E ranks E first. This makes it unlikely higher-priority parents (A/B/C) will apply to Nursery_E soon, but accepting Parent_D now would lock in a low-priority match and foreclose the chance (however small) of getting A/B/C later.

Currently only Parent_E is applying this round; Parent_D previously applied and was rejected. Parent_E is the lowest priority on our list, so accepting now could block a higher-priority parent (A/B/C) from matching with us later if they become unmatched and apply. Given parents’ preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last and is likely to match elsewhere; Parent_B ranks E 4th; Parent_C ranks E last; Parent_D ranks E last; Parent_E ranks E first. So the probability that higher-priority parents will come to us is low, but not zero. However, we already rejected Parent_E twice; continuing to reject risks ending unmatched if no one else applies. With round 3 still early, but only one seat and no other applicants, the safe way to secure a match is to accept Parent_E now. This maximizes expected filled seat though not true-priority optimal, but true-priority goal is conditional on matching; leaving seat empty is worse than matching with someone on list, and Parent_E is on the list.
