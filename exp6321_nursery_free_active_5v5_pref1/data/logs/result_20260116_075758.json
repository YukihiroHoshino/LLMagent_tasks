I understand allocations must follow your priority order and that an [ACCEPT] is final under the rules; if no higher-priority family (Parents A–D) is in contention this round and you’re able to close the allocation, I would be very grateful to be selected. Thank you for reconsidering my application this round. [APPLY]",
              "thought": "Only Nursery_E remains unmatched and it is my top true preference. With few rounds left, the best chance to secure any match is to continue submitting a formal application each round so Nursery_E can accept immediately if no higher-priority parent applies this round."

Please confirm that you accept the place at Nursery_E, and we will proceed with the enrollment paperwork and next steps immediately.",
              "thought": "My true priority list ranks Parent_E last. However, by round 27 no higher-priority parents (A–D) have ever approached Nursery_E, and Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is ready to confirm immediately. With only a few rounds left (up to 30), continuing to hold the seat risks ending unmatched, which is worse than matching with a lower-priority but acceptable parent who is on my list. Since no higher-priority applicants are in this round’s inbox and there is no evidence they will appear, accepting Parent_E now maximizes expected outcome versus leaving the place unfilled."
