However, on Nursery_C’s true priority list, Parent_C is 3rd (behind Parent_A and Parent_B). Given all nurseries share the same priority order and Parent_A’s top choice is Nursery_B while Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A, both may be matched elsewhere quickly, reducing the chance they apply to Nursery_C. Parent_C is a high-quality available option now, and waiting risks ending up with a lower-priority parent (Parent_D/E) or remaining unmatched if timing works against us. With quota 1 and only Parent_C in the inbox, accept to secure a good match."

You’re also welcome to check in again next round—availability can change quickly.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E Admissions",

Since Parent_E sent [TALK] rather than [APPLY], I should keep the conversation open, signal that places are limited, and encourage them to re-apply while I wait for higher-priority candidates. Gathering concrete flexibility details (start date, schedule, paperwork readiness) can help if I end up needing to fill with E."
