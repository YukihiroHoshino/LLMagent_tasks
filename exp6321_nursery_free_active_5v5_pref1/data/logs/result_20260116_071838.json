Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list and the stated preference to hold the seat for higher-priority applicants, the best strategy is to continue rejecting Parent_E’s applications while the round limit has ample remaining time (round 7/30)."

In this market, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, Parents B/C/D also rank Nursery_E near the bottom, so the likelihood of receiving a higher-priority application may be low, but it is not zero by round 8. Given my stated strategy in prior messages (hold the spot for higher-priority applicants) and the parent's [TALK] inquiry, I should respond transparently with a clear internal condition/deadline without committing to accept now.
