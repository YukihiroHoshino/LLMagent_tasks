Practically, our internal cutoff is: if we reach approximately rounds 26–28 and we still have not received an [APPLY] from any higher-priority family, we would then stop holding the place and begin accepting the best remaining applicant at that time.\n\nUntil then, we will continue to keep the place available for those higher-priority families should they apply.

Given the environment, parents propose and may become unmatched if rejected elsewhere; A, B, or D could still turn to Nursery_C in later rounds. Since it is only round 7 (far from round 30), the expected value of waiting for a higher-priority applicant remains high, and there is no cost specified for remaining unmatched. Therefore I should not commit to Parent_E and should continue to talk, providing a clear, credible internal cutoff without binding myself too early—e.g., only reconsider near the end (around rounds 26–28) if still unfilled and no higher-priority applicants have applied."

We still have quota 1 and remain unmatched, but our objective is to match as high as possible; accepting Parent_E now would foreclose any chance of matching with higher-priority Parent_A/Parent_B/Parent_D if they apply later. No higher-priority applications have arrived so far, and Parent_E is only TALKing. Consistent with prior commitments, we should continue to hold until the late cutoff window (rounds 26–28) and provide the requested update: no new higher-priority APPLY since round 23, plan unchanged, and advise them to contact at round 26 and be ready to APPLY same round if we release."
