Only Parent_E ranks Nursery_E as 1st choice and is applying immediately.

Given quota=1 and that accepting Parent_C now secures a match with a parent who ranks me first, rejecting to wait for A/B risks ending unmatched or receiving a lower-ranked applicant later. Since all nurseries share the same priority order, Parent_A and Parent_B are likely to be taken by their higher-preference nurseries (A and/or B) early. Therefore, accepting Parent_C is a safe and good outcome within my quota."

Accepting Parent_B now would fill our only quota and prevent matching with Parent_A if they apply later. Given Parent_A ranks Nursery_A as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_B), it is plausible they may first apply to Nursery_B and could still come to us later if rejected there. Since we cannot ‘hold’ an application under the rules and must accept or reject, the optimal strategy to maximize our match on the true priority list is to reject Parent_B now to preserve the seat for a potential higher-priority Parent_A."
