Parent_E is the lowest-priority acceptable parent, so accepting now would likely block a better match if Parent_A/Parent_B/Parent_C later apply (they all outrank E in our priority). Given the market: Parent_A prefers B then A then C then D; Parent_B prefers A then C then B then E then D; Parent_C prefers C then B then A then D. These parents may not reach us immediately, but D is 4th choice for A and B and 4th for C, so they could come later if rejected elsewhere.

Thank you for continuing to consider my repeated applications.\n\nSince we are now in Round 16 and the place is still unfilled, I wanted to ask one practical question so we can plan responsibly: in this round, is there any scenario under which you would actually fill the seat (i.e., extend an offer) if no higher-priority family applies again—such as if you receive zero applications from Parents A–D for several consecutive rounds, or if the process is approaching its final rounds?\n\nIf the answer is yes, I can be immediately reachable and can complete enrollment the same day (paperwork, deposits, start-date confirmation). If the answer is no (i.e., you intend to hold the seat regardless until a higher-priority family applies), please let me know candidly so I can make appropriate contingency plans.\n\nSincerely,\nParent_E",

Since repeated APPLY attempts have been rejected due to the nursery holding for higher-priority families, a TALK message is more useful now: ask for a concrete, actionable condition/timing for when they would actually fill the seat, and offer to be immediately reachable to finalize enrollment the moment they decide to fill it. This preserves eligibility without wasting another likely auto-reject APPLY."
