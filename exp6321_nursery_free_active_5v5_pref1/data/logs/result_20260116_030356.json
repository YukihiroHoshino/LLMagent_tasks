On Nursery_E’s true priority list, Parent_E is ranked 5th (lowest), so ideally we would like to wait for higher-priority parents (A–D). However, given Parent_E ranks Nursery_E as their 1st choice, accepting now guarantees filling our single seat with a committed parent; rejecting risks ending unmatched if higher-priority parents never apply to Nursery_E (they all rank Nursery_E last). Since Parent_A–D all place Nursery_E last, it is unlikely they will apply unless rejected elsewhere many times. Therefore, accepting Parent_E now maximizes the chance of filling the quota while still matching with an acceptable parent."

Although Parent_A and Parent_B are higher on my true priority list, neither has contacted me this round; Parent_A prefers Nursery_B first and Parent_B prefers Nursery_A first, so they are less likely to apply to me early (and may match elsewhere). With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now secures a match with a mid-ranked but fully acceptable parent rather than risking ending unmatched while waiting for higher-priority parents who may never apply.

Parent_D’s first choice is Nursery_D; Parent_C’s is Nursery_C; Parent_E’s is Nursery_E—each likely to apply to their top choices first. Parent_B ranks Nursery_A first and is applying now, making them a strong, likely-to-match candidate. Accepting Parent_B secures a high-priority match (2nd on our list) with low risk of missing out on Parent_A, who is likely to be taken by Nursery_B. Therefore accept."
