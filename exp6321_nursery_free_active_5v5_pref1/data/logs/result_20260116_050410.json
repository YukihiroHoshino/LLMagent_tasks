The trigger that would allow us to release the place is being able to confirm that the higher-priority families ahead of you will not be pursuing Nursery_C (e.g., they become matched elsewhere in the market or otherwise definitively exit consideration of Nursery_C). If that confirmation occurs, we will immediately contact the next eligible family in line with a strict, time-limited offer window.\n\nThank you again for your patience and continued interest.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_C Admissions\n\n[REJECT]",
              "thought": "Nursery_C’s true priority order is A > B > C > D > E, quota 1. Parent_E is lowest priority. No other parents contacted Nursery_C this round, but higher-priority parents (A or B especially) could still apply later; accepting E now would lock in a low-priority match and prevent upgrading. Given the objective to match as high as possible on the priority list and the ability to leave unfilled, it is optimal to continue rejecting Parent_E’s repeated applications while keeping the seat available for A/B (or C/D) if they approach. Provide a clear trigger/checkpoint to reduce repeated inquiries while still not committing."

As we are now in round 24 and Nursery_C remains unmatched, I would like to submit a formal application again for your single place.\n\nIf you are able to release/allocate the place to me at any point, I confirm I will accept immediately (within 10 minutes of an offer, and well within any strict expiry window) and I can complete all enrollment steps the same day (forms, deposit, and documentation).\n\nIf you are still holding the place precautionarily for higher-priority families, could you please confirm whether there is any concrete internal deadline/checkpoint (e.g., end of round 24 or round 25) after which you will release the place if no higher-priority family has actively applied? If the place can be released at any time, please contact me right away and I will confirm immediately.\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

              "thought": "Nursery_C’s true priority is A > B > C > D > E, quota 1. Parent_E is lowest priority. However, by round 24 no higher-priority parent has approached Nursery_C at all; Parent_C applied earlier and was rejected, and Parent_E has persistently applied. Given the approaching round limit (30), continued precautionary holding risks ending unmatched, which is strictly worse than matching with an acceptable parent on our list (Parent_E is included). Accepting Parent_E now secures a filled seat and avoids the risk that Parent_E matches elsewhere while no higher-priority family ever applies. This sacrifices the chance of a late higher-priority applicant, but that chance appears low given full market info and long inactivity. Therefore accept Parent_E."
