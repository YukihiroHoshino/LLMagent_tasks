Parent_E has repeatedly applied and is highly committed, but accepting now would lock in my lowest-ranked acceptable parent and foreclose the chance to match with any higher-ranked parent later. With rounds remaining (current round 25 of 30) and no cost to holding the seat besides continued delay, the optimal strategy to maximize my match quality is to continue rejecting Parent_E until it is clear no higher-priority parent will arrive. Therefore, reject again while confirming their application remains eligible and no resubmission is needed."
