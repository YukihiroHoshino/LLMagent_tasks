Accepting Parent_B now secures a high-priority match within our quota and avoids the risk of remaining unmatched if Parent_A never comes to us or we lose Parent_B to another nursery. Since we cannot later ‘upgrade’ after accepting (match removes both agents), we weigh the chance of getting Parent_A: Parent_A likely applies to Nursery_B first, where Nursery_B also prioritizes Parent_A highest, so Parent_A will probably be accepted there and never reach us. Therefore, accepting Parent_B is optimal."

However, given Parent_D lists us as their 1st choice, accepting now secures a match. If we reject to wait for higher-priority parents (A/B/C), they are unlikely to apply to us because Nursery_D is 4th for A and B, and 4th for C as well; they will pursue A/B/C first and likely match elsewhere.
