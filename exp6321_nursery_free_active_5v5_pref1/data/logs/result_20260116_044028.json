However, Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as their 2nd choice (after Nursery_A) and may apply later if rejected elsewhere; Parent_A ranks us 3rd (after Nursery_B and Nursery_A) and could also come later. With quota 1, accepting Parent_C now guarantees a match but may forgo a higher-priority parent who could arrive in later rounds. Given the mechanism: once we [ACCEPT], we are removed and cannot upgrade. Since higher-priority candidates have plausible paths to us (especially Parent_B if Nursery_A fills with Parent_A), it is strategically better to reject Parent_C now to keep capacity for Parent_A/Parent_B, even though it risks ending unmatched.
