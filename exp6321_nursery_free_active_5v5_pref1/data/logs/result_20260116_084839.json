Our true priority list ranks Parent_E last, but we only accept from within this list, so Parent_E is acceptable if no higher-priority parent is available/likely to apply. In round 10, only Parent_E has applied to Nursery_E. Given Parent preferences, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_B ranks Nursery_E 4th; Parent_C ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_D ranks Nursery_E last; Parent_E ranks Nursery_E 1st. It is therefore unlikely that any higher-priority parent will apply to Nursery_E now, and further waiting risks ending unmatched.
