Although Parent_B is applying now and has Nursery_A as first choice, I should consider whether holding the seat could yield Parent_A, who is my top choice. Parent_A’s first choice is Nursery_B (then Nursery_A), and since all nurseries share the same priority order, Nursery_B will likely accept Parent_A if Parent_A applies there, meaning Parent_A may not reach me. Given that risk, accepting Parent_B now secures a high-ranked (2nd) candidate who strongly prefers me, which is likely better than waiting and ending up with a lower-ranked parent or an unfilled seat."

Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_A ranks Nursery_D 4th; Parent_B ranks Nursery_D last; Parent_C ranks Nursery_D 4th; Parent_D ranks Nursery_D 1st; Parent_E ranks Nursery_D last. Given this, Parent_D is the only parent who is strongly likely to apply to Nursery_D early and persistently. Waiting for Parent_A/B/C is risky: they will first pursue Nurseries B/A/C respectively, and those nurseries all share the same priority order, meaning Parent_A is top-ranked everywhere and likely to be accepted by their higher choices before ever coming to Nursery_D. Parent_B and Parent_C also have higher-ranked options they prefer, and Nursery_D is low on their lists, so they may never apply here.
