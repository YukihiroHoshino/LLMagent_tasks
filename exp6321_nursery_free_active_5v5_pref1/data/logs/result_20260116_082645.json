With quota 1, accepting Parent_E now would lock in my lowest-priority match and foreclose the chance to match with a higher-priority parent in later rounds. Since leaving unfilled is preferable to taking someone outside the list (not relevant here), the optimal strategy is to wait and reject Parent_E now to preserve capacity for a higher-ranked parent."
