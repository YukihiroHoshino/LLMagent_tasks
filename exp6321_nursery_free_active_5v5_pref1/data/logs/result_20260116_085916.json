Although I have been repeatedly rejected and they indicated no specific condition would change the decision, the rules suggest availability can change across rounds and the nursery invited re-application in future rounds. Therefore I will submit a concise [APPLY] again, reaffirming immediate acceptance and flexibility, without repeating lengthy arguments."

However, Parent_A and Parent_B have not contacted Nursery_C in any round, and given their preferences (A ranks C 3rd; B ranks C 2nd), they are likely pursuing/held by higher-ranked options (A: Nursery_B/Nursery_A; B: Nursery_A) and may never apply here. Parent_C ranks Nursery_C first and has repeatedly applied, indicating immediate acceptance and low risk of losing them if we accept now. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched by round 30 with no better applicant arriving. Therefore, accept Parent_C to secure a match rather than remain unfilled."
