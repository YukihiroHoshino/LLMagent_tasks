In this market, Parent_A/B/C all rank Nursery_D low (4th/5th/4th respectively) and are likely to apply to their higher choices first, so waiting for them is risky. Parent_D ranks me 1st and is ready to commit, making this a high-probability secure match now. Since no higher-priority applicants are in my inbox this round, accepting Parent_D maximizes certainty of filling my seat, albeit not with my top-ranked parent."

However, in round 1 the only applicant is Parent_E. Waiting could attract higher-priority parents (A–D), but none rank Nursery_E highly (it is last for A–D), so they are unlikely to apply unless rejected elsewhere much later, creating significant risk of ending unmatched. Parent_E ranks Nursery_E first and is ready to commit, making acceptance now the best way to secure a match rather than holding out for an unlikely higher-priority applicant."
