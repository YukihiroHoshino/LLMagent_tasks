Given the objective to match as high as possible on the true priority list within quota 1, and that leaving the seat unfilled is preferable to accepting someone outside the list (though Parent_E is on the list, they are lowest), the best strategy remains to hold the seat for any higher-priority parent who might apply before round 30. History shows repeated applications from Parent_E and consistent rejections under the same rationale; no new information changes the priority-based decision."
