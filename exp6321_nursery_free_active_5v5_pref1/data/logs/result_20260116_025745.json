I’m checking in this round to confirm Nursery_E remains my first choice, and I’m still able to start immediately (or on very short notice) and complete all paperwork the same day.\n\nCould you please advise whether there is any realistic chance of an opening this round (e.g., pending declines), and if so, what is the best way to ensure I’m considered immediately—will you contact waitlisted families directly, or is there a specific step you’d like me to take this round?\n\nKind regards,\nParent_E",

Repeated [APPLY] attempts have been rejected, so in this round I will use [TALK] to (1) confirm I am still first choice and ready to accept immediately, (2) ask directly whether there is any realistic prospect of an opening this round, and (3) ask what exact trigger/action will ensure I am contacted first if a place frees up. This keeps me active on the waitlist without another likely-ineffective formal application."

If an opening arises due to a last-minute change/decline, we will contact families on our internal waitlist directly. If you would like to be actively reconsidered in a given round (rather than only waiting for us to reach out), the best step is to submit a formal [APPLY] message that round.\n\nTo help us move quickly if a place becomes available, could you please confirm:\n1) your child’s date of birth/age,\n2) the schedule you need (full-time/part-time, days/hours), and\n3) the best phone number/email for immediate contact.\n\nKind regards,\nNursery_E Admissions\n\n[TALK]",
              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and currently no matches. True priority is A > B > C > D > E, so Parent_E is lowest among acceptable candidates. However, only Parent_E contacted us this round, and their message is [TALK], so no accept/reject decision is required now. Strategically, we should keep the option open in case a higher-priority parent (A–D) applies in a later round. Given repeated prior rejections, we should be transparent: there is no confirmed opening yet; if something changes we will contact waitlisted families; to be actively reconsidered each round they should submit [APPLY]. We should also request any final info needed for rapid placement (start date already given; ask for child age, schedule, contact)."

However, Parent_E is the only applicant in the inbox this round, and their own preference ranks Nursery_E first, meaning an acceptance would lock in a guaranteed match now. Given repeated rejections, we have effectively been holding out for higher-priority parents (A–D), but none have approached us through round 9; those parents all rank Nursery_E last and are likely to match elsewhere, so waiting longer risks ending unmatched. With no competing applicants and limited rounds, accepting Parent_E now maximizes the chance we fill our seat rather than remain empty, even though Parent_E is lowest on our list."
