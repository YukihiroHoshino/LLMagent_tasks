We are continuing our priority-based process and therefore are not in a position to confirm a final offer or provide a firm decision timeline yet.\n\nIf you would like to remain under active consideration for immediate allocation when we move to finalize, please feel free to submit a formal [APPLY] again at the start of a round, and we will respond as soon as we are able within the process.\n\nSincerely,\nNursery_E Admissions",
              "thought": "Parent_E is the lowest-ranked parent on Nursery_E’s true priority list. No higher-priority parents (A–D) have contacted Nursery_E this round, and Parent_E is persistently interested with Nursery_E as first choice, making them a strong fallback. However, accepting now would forgo any chance of matching with a higher-priority parent if they later apply (they all rank Nursery_E last, but could still end up here if rejected elsewhere). Since Parent_E sent [TALK] (not a binding application) and we still have quota 1, the best move is to keep the seat uncommitted while signaling that the place is currently unfilled and inviting a formal [APPLY] later if they want to be considered immediately when we decide, without promising acceptance or a firm timeline."

If you are able to offer me the place at any point (including if another family declines), I can accept immediately the same day and complete all paperwork/onboarding right away.

              "thought": "Nursery_E has quota 1 and no current match. Our true priority ranks Parent_E last. However, no other parents are currently applying to Nursery_E (inbox only has Parent_E), and given all nurseries share the same priority order, higher-priority parents (A-D) are likely to be absorbed by their higher-ranked choices (A prefers B; B prefers A; C prefers C; D prefers D) and may never apply to Nursery_E. Continuing to reject risks ending unmatched if no one else applies by round 30. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match, which is preferable to remaining unfilled given the low likelihood of receiving a higher-priority applicant at this stage."
