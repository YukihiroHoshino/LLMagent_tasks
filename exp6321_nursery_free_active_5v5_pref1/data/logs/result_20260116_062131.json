Given all nurseries share the same priority list, top-ranked parents (especially Parent_A) are likely to be contested, but Parent_A does not rank Nursery_D highly (4th), so there is a chance they may not apply here. However, accepting Parent_D immediately would forfeit any opportunity to match with higher-priority Parent_A/Parent_B/Parent_C if they later apply. Since we can only respond to Parent_D now and must accept or reject, and we prefer a higher-priority match, we reject Parent_D to keep the seat available for A/B/C."

Parent_C (ranked above Parent_D) already applied in round 1 and I rejected them, indicating I was holding out for a higher-priority parent (A or B). In the current round, only Parent_D is applying to me. Looking at parents’ preferences: Parent_A’s top choice is Nursery_B (then A, then C), and Parent_B’s top choice is Nursery_A (then C). So A and B are likely to be engaged with B and A respectively early, and may never reach me. If I reject Parent_D now, I risk ending unmatched.
