This fills Nursery_D with Parent_A immediately, so Parent_C cannot obtain Nursery_D regardless of how they rank it. In the next round, the remaining best achievable for Parent_C is Nursery_C, and there is a cycle Parent_C->C and Nursery_C->Parent_C (since Nursery_C’s higher-priority parents are removed), so ranking Nursery_C next guarantees Parent_C gets Nursery_C. Any attempt to rank Nursery_C first would still not improve beyond Nursery_C (since Nursery_D is unattainable), and misranking could only risk delaying/complicating without benefit. Therefore, submit the true order to secure Nursery_C as the best feasible outcome.",True,Nursery_A,False,True,4

With the given priorities, Nursery_B ranks you #1 and Nursery_C ranks you #1, so listing them below Nursery_D preserves the chance to get Nursery_D if available while guaranteeing you still secure a highly ranked option.
