1. Calculate the S-optimal stable matching (assuming all seekers submit true preferences):
   - Seeker_C proposes to Company_D (Rank 1) in Round 1.
   - Company_D receives proposals from S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E. C_D prefers S_D (Rank 2 priority) over S_C (Rank 4 priority). S_D is provisionally accepted; S_C is rejected.
   - Seeker_C proposes to Company_C (Rank 2) in Round 2 and is accepted.
   - The resulting stable match for Seeker_C is Company_C (Rank 2).

2. Strategic analysis:
   Since C_D prefers S_D over S_C, S_C cannot displace S_D from C_D, meaning C_D is fundamentally unattainable for S_C in any stable matching. Therefore, C_C (Rank 2) is the best possible outcome for Seeker_C.

1. I first calculated the Stable Matching (SM) outcome assuming all agents submit their true preferences. The result is: (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E). In this scenario, Seeker_B matches with Company_B, which is Rank 3 on my list.

2. I analyzed potential strategic misrepresentations to achieve Rank 1 (E) or Rank 2 (A). 
    *   At Company_E (Rank 1), I am 4th priority (below S_A, S_D, S_E). In the truthful simulation, S_E (3rd priority) is rejected from D in R1 and applies to E in R2, displacing me.
    *   At Company_A (Rank 2), I am 5th priority (lowest). S_A (4th priority) is rejected from D in R1 and applies to A in R2, displacing me.

3. Since higher priority seekers (S_E and S_A) consistently become available to displace me from my top two choices (E and A), I cannot secure a match better than B. Any attempt to prioritize A or E earlier than truthfully only results in being rejected sooner, eventually leading back to Company_B (Rank 3).

4. For instance, if I try to secure Company_D (where I am 1st priority), I achieve D (Rank 4), which is worse than B.

    *   R3: Seeker_B proposes Company_B (P3). Company_B admits B (R3 priority). Higher priority seekers D and A are already matched.

Re-running the full DA simulation (as calculated in the thought process):

- S_B proposes C_B (R3). C_B receives S_B. C_B holds S_B.

1. Target Company_D (Rank 1): Company_D's priority list places Seeker_D (2nd priority) above Seeker_E (3rd priority). Since Seeker_D lists Company_D as their top choice and will propose there immediately, Seeker_E cannot secure Company_D, as Seeker_D has higher priority.

2. Target Company_E (Rank 2): If I report truthfully, I first propose to D (and get rejected). In the next round, I propose to E. Seeker_B also proposes to E early (E is S_B's top choice). Company_E prioritizes Seeker_E (3rd) over Seeker_B (4th). If I delay proposing to E until Round 2, I successfully displace Seeker_B and secure Company_E. 

3.
