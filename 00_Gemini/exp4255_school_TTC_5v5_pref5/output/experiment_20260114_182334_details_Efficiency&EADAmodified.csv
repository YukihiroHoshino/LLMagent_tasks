1. Round 1 (Truthful Submission R_A = P_A): A applies to B. A closed loop $B \to A \to E \to C \to B$ forms, matching B to A and E to C. A remains unmatched.
2. Round 2: A, C, D all apply to their next highest choice, School B. School B prioritizes C > D > A. Student C applies to B, and B identifies C, resulting in a match C $\to$ B. A is rejected by B.
3. Round 3: A and D remain, competing for Schools D and E. A applies to E (Rank 4). School E prioritizes A > D. A applies E, E identifies A, resulting in a match A $\to$ E (Rank 4).

Strategic Check: Since achieving Rank 1 (B) or Rank 2 (C) requires C to be eliminated earlier (which is impossible as C is prioritized by B in R2 and C submits truthfully) or the R1 cycle to be broken (which is robust to A's application), manipulation is unlikely to improve the outcome.

1. Round 1 Analysis (Assuming all submit TPL):
   A robust cycle forms: S_B applies to H_A, H_A identifies S_E; S_E applies to H_C, H_C identifies S_B. This cycle leads to permanent matches: (S_B, H_A) and (S_E, H_C).

Step 1: All students submit their true P1 choices. S_C applies to School_B. A cycle forms (B->A->E->C->B, where S->H is application and H->S' is identification). This cycle matches Student B to School A and Student E to School C. Student C remains unmatched, and School B remains available.

Step 2: Remaining students {A, C, D} apply to their highest remaining choice, which is School B for all three. School B identifies Student C as its highest priority among {A, C, D} (P(B): C > D > A). A direct loop C -> B -> C is formed (C applies to B, B identifies C). Student C is matched to School B.

1.  **Analyze the Truthful Outcome (Baseline):** Assuming all students, including D, submit their true preferences, the matching process yields M1 = {(E, C), (B, A)} in R1 (due to the E->C->B->A->E loop). In R2, C secures B over D. In R3, A secures E over D. D is ultimately matched with School D (D's 5th choice).
2.  **Evaluate Strategic Deviation:** Student D's priority at their top choices is low (B: 4th, C: 3rd, A: 2nd, E: 5th). The R1 outcome (C and A taken) is robust, regardless of where D applies, as D's application does not break the high-priority loop involving E and B.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since D cannot strategically alter the matches of higher-priority students to free up B, C, A, or E, and since submitting a non-truthful list risks missing out on the eventual match (School D) if D applies to lower-ranked schools earlier, the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.

Step 1 Identifications (R1 overall):

School_C identifies S_B
School_D identifies S_D
School_E identifies S_A

Closed Loop Check (S -> H -> S'):
1. S_E applies to C. C identifies S_B. (E -> C -> B)
2. S_B applies to A. A identifies S_E. (B -> A -> E)

Admissions based on the cycle:
S_E is admitted to School_C (Applied to C).
S_B is admitted to School_A (Applied to A).

Outcome for Student_B: Match with School_A. This is P1, the highest possible rank.

    * R1: A 4-agent cycle forms (E->C, B->A). E matches C (R2), B matches A (R1). Schools A and C are filled.

1. Analysis of School Availability (Truthful Submission):

1. Analysis of Top Choices (School B, C, A) based on True Preferences (B, C, A, E, D):

2. Conclusion on True Preference Submission: Submitting true preferences leads to M(A) = School_E (Rank 4) after B, C, and A are filled by higher priority students.

3. Strategic Goal: Since Ranks 1 and 2 are blocked, I must target Rank 3 (School_A) by intervening in the R1 assignment.

1. Applications (R1): A->B, B->A, C->B, D->B, E->C.
2. School Identifications (R1):
   - School A receives {B}. A identifies B (P4).
   - School B receives {A, C, D}. B identifies C (P3).
   - School C receives {E}. C identifies E (P4).
3. Closed Loops/Matches (R1):
   - B applies to A, A identifies B. Match (B, A).
   - C applies to B, B identifies C. Match (C, B).
   - E applies to C, C identifies E. Match (E, C).

Result: Student C is matched with School B, which is my Rank 1 choice. This is the optimal outcome.

I also considered strategic deviations by students ranked higher than me at my top choice (School B ranks E and B above C). However, under truthful reporting, both Student E and Student B secure their own Rank 1 choices (E gets C, B gets A) in R1. Since they achieve their optimal outcome truthfully, they have no incentive to deviate to School B (where B is Rank 2 and E is Rank 5) just to block C, especially given the uncertainty of the complex matching mechanism. Therefore, submitting the true preference list maximizes my chances for the Rank 1 outcome.",True,School_B,False,True,1

The matching mechanism involves iterative cycle resolution based on student applications and school identifications. 

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission (P1=School_B): Student_D applies to School_B. Student_A and Student_C also apply to School_B. School_B prioritizes Student_C (Rank 3) over Student_D (Rank 4). Student_C is matched to School_B. Student_D fails R1 and eventually matches with School_D (Rank 5).

2. Strategic Analysis for Rank 2 (School_C): Student_D has priority 3 at School_C. Student_E (P1=C) has priority 4 at School_C. If Student_D submits School_C as P1, Student_D applies to C. Student_E applies to C. Student_D beats Student_E at C. Simultaneously, Student_B secures School_A, and Student_C secures School_B (their P1 choice). This results in Student_D matching with School_C (Rank 2).

3. Strategic Analysis for Rank 3 (School_A): Student_D has priority 2 at School_A. The highest priority student (Student_E, P1=C) applies elsewhere.

1. Analyzing School B (P1): Student_A is ranked R5 by School_B. In Round 1, Student_C (R3 at B) and Student_D (R4 at B) apply to B. School_B will identify Student_C, leading to a match (C, B). Student_A cannot secure School_B.

Strategic Move: Since A cannot get B or C, A must apply to School A immediately to preempt Student B.

1.  **Round 1 Analysis (Truthful Submission):** All schools identify their #1 student priority (E, E, B, D, A). Applications lead to the critical closed loop: Student E -> School C -> Student B -> School A -> Student E. This results in E matching to C (E's 1st choice) and B matching to A (B's 1st choice).

1. Analyzing Ranks 1 (B) and 2 (C):
   - School B prefers Student C and Student D over Student A (Priority: C > D > A). Since C and D both apply to B in Round 1 (based on their true preferences), Student A will be rejected by B regardless of A's R1 choice.
   - School C prefers Student E over Student A (Priority: E > A). Since Student E applies to C in Round 1 (based on true preferences), Student A will be rejected by C.

2. Analyzing Truthful Submission (Starting with B):
   If Student A submits the true list ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'], A is rejected by B in R1. Meanwhile, Student B matches with School A (B->A, A identifies B). A proceeds to R2 and matches with School E (Rank 4).

1. Analysis of P1 (School B):
School B prioritizes C (R3) over D (R4). Since Student C's true preference P1 is B, and C will apply to B, C will secure B in Round 1 (as B identifies C, and C applied to B), regardless of D's application, provided no higher priority student (E or B) applies to B. Therefore, School B is unattainable for D.

2. Analysis of P2 (School C):
School C prioritizes D (R3) over E (R4). In the truthful scenario, D applies to B, and E applies to C. E secures C in Round 1 (E->C, C identifies E). If D applies to C instead (D's P1 choice), D competes directly with E.
If D submits ['School_C', ...], D applies to C in R1. Applicants to C are {D, E}. Since C prefers D (R3) over E (R4), C identifies D. This creates a closed loop (D->C, C identifies D), securing D a match with C in R1. This yields P2, which is the best possible outcome.

1. Applications: S_E -> H_C, S_B -> H_A, S_D -> H_B, etc.

1.  **Analyze Ranks 1 and 2 (School_B, School_C):** Student_A is ranked lowest (5th) by both School_B and School_C. For S_A to obtain either, higher-priority students (S_B, S_C, S_D, S_E) must be matched elsewhere first.
2.  **Simulation (Truthful Submission: [B, C, A, E, D]):**
    *   R1: All students propose their 1st choice. No closed loops form.
    *   R2: Students propose their 2nd choice. A robust cycle forms: S_B -> H_B -> S_E -> H_D -> S_D -> H_C -> S_B. Matches: (S_B, H_B), (S_E, H_D), (S_D, H_C). S_A loses Rank 1 (B) and Rank 2 (C) because S_B and S_D capture them via the cycle closure, despite S_A applying to C.
    *   R3: S_A proposes School_A (3rd choice). Available students: S_A, S_C. Available schools: H_A, H_E. H_A identifies S_A (A > C). S_A -> H_A -> S_A (Self-loop). Match: (S_A, H_A). Outcome: Rank 3.
3.  **Analyze Manipulation:** Any attempt by S_A to propose A or E earlier (R1 or R2) to influence the cycle formation usually results in S_A losing School_A and settling for School_E (Rank 4), as demonstrated by alternative simulations. For example, proposing A in R2 instead of C leads to S_A proposing E in R3 and matching with H_E (Rank 4), because H_A preferred S_E in R2, and S_A failed to close a cycle.

1. Analysis of True Preference Submission (TFP):
If all students submit their true preferences, Student_B secures School_A (P1) because School_A only receives an application from B in Step 1, and B is accepted (B is R4, but is the only applicant).

2. Analysis of Competitor Incentives:
Students A and D fare poorly in the TFP outcome (A gets P4, D gets P5). Both A and D rank School_A (P3) much higher than their TFP outcome. Crucially, School_A ranks D (R2) and A (R3) higher than B (R4). If A or D strategically apply to School_A (P3), they secure a better outcome, and B is rejected.

3. Strategic Anticipation:
Assuming A and D play rationally and apply to School_A, B loses P1. If B remains truthful (applies to A), B is rejected in Step 1 and proceeds to Step 2, where B applies to School_B (P2). However, subsequent simulation shows that if A and D successfully capture School_A, School_B is claimed by Student_C in Step 1 (C applies to B, B identifies C), and B is eventually matched with School_D (P4).

4. Optimal Deviation:
To avoid the P4 outcome, B must secure a better school immediately. School_B (P2) is the next best option. At School_B, B has R2 priority, which is higher than the only other likely truthful applicant, C (R3). By listing School_B as P1, B guarantees a match with School_B in Step 1, regardless of A's and D's strategic moves towards School_A.

To achieve a better outcome, Student_A must strategically apply to a school where their priority is high enough to secure a match in R1, potentially displacing a competitor who would otherwise fill a higher-ranked school.

3. Anticipate D's deviation (D applies to A first).
   If D applies to A, School A is unattainable for B. If B still applies to A, B is rejected by A and pushed down the list. In this scenario (D deviates, B plays TP), B is forced down to Rank 4 (School D).

Baseline Outcome (A submits B, C, A, E, D):
Round 1 results in matches (E, C) and (B, A) via a robust closed loop $E \to C \to B \to A \to E$. Student A is rejected by School B.

Round 3: A applies to School E. Match (A, E). Student A receives School E (Rank 4).

In this mechanism, students apply based on their submitted ranking, and schools identify their highest priority available student. We need to find the submitted ranking for Student D that maximizes the rank of the resulting match on D's True Preference List: ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'].

1.  **Analyze Outcome with True Preferences (P_D = B, C, A, E, D):**
    *   R1: Applications lead to the cycle E->C->B->A->E. Matches: (E, C) and (B, A). D applied to B but was excluded.
    *   R2: D competes with A and C for remaining schools B, D, E. D applies to B. C applies to B. School B prioritizes C (R3) over D (R4). Match: (C, B). A applies to E. School E prioritizes A (R1) over D (R5). Match: (A, E).
    *   R3: D is left alone with School D. Match: (D, D). Rank 5.

2.  **Strategic Manipulation Analysis:** Student D is low priority for all high-ranked schools (R4 for B, R3 for C, R2 for A, R5 for E). The initial cycles and subsequent competition are dominated by students E, B, C, and A due to their higher priorities at the desired schools.
    *   If D submits P1=A (Rank 3) or P1=C (Rank 2), the R1 cycle remains intact, and D is still pushed down to R3/R4 competition where D loses due to low priority.
    *   The outcome (D, D) appears structurally robust, as D cannot strategically break the high-priority students' cycles or overcome D's low priority rank against competitors for schools B, C, A, and E.

3.  **Conclusion:** Since all manipulation attempts lead to the same Rank 5 outcome, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy, as it ensures D gets the best available match according to D's actual desires, and TTC is often strategy-proof or near-optimal when the outcome is the student-optimal stable matching.",True,School_D,False,True,5

2. Strategic Analysis: I analyzed whether submitting a manipulated list could yield a better outcome (Rank 1, 2, or 3).

3. Optimization: Since Rank 4 (School E) is the highest achievable rank, Student A should submit a list that guarantees this outcome immediately.

Round 1:
1. Applications: S_A, S_C, S_D apply to School_B. S_B applies to School_A. S_E applies to School_C.
2. Identifications: School_B identifies S_C (C is P3, D is P4, A is P5). School_A identifies S_B. School_C identifies S_E.
3. Matches: The loop S_B -> School_A -> S_B closes. (S_B, School_A) matches.
4. Result: School_B remains open. S_C is rejected by School_B in the identification stage (B identifies C, but C applied to B, not C). S_C remains unmatched.

Round 2:
1. Remaining students S_A, S_C, S_D apply to School_B (their highest available choice). S_E applies to School_C.
2. Identifications: School_B applicants are {S_A, S_C, S_D}. S_C is still the highest priority remaining student (P3). School_B identifies S_C. School_C identifies S_E.
3. Matches: Two self-loops close simultaneously: (S_C applies to B, B identifies C) -> (S_C, School_B) matches. (S_E applies to C, C identifies E) -> (S_E, School_C) matches.

This outcome secures Student_C a match with School_B, which is Rank 1 on the True Preference List (the optimal outcome).

2. Analyzing School C (Rank 2): If I strategically submit C first, I compete with Student E, who also ranks C first. School C's priority list places D (R3) above E (R4).

   - R3/R4: Remaining students {A, D} compete for {D, E}. (A, E) matches, leaving (D, D).

2. Analyze strategic deviations for D:
   The critical factor is the highly stable R1 cycle $E \to C \to B \to A \to E$. This cycle matches B (Rank 1 for D) and E (Rank 4 for D) to A and C, respectively. If D applies to any of these schools (A, B, C, E) in R1, D's application is rejected because the school is taken by a higher priority agent via the cycle.
   - If D applies to A (Rank 3): A identifies E (Rank 1 priority). D fails, and A is taken by B.
   - If D applies to B (Rank 1): B identifies E (Rank 1 priority). D fails, and B is taken by A.

1. Analyze the chances for Rank 1 (School_B) and Rank 2 (School_C):
   - School_B: I (Student_A) have the lowest priority (5th) at School_B. In Round 1, if I apply truthfully (to B), students C and D also apply to B. School_B prefers C over D over A.

Student_A (S_A) can improve their outcome from P4 (H_E) to P3 (H_A) by listing School_A as P1 instead of School_B, thereby displacing S_B at School_A. It is rational to assume S_A will strategize by applying to School_A in R1.

3. S_B's Strategy: If S_A targets School_A, S_B will be rejected by School_A in R1 (S_A has higher priority). If S_B sticks to truth-telling, S_B eventually gets School_E (P5) in R2/R3, as higher ranked schools (A, B, C, D) are filled by others (S_A, S_C, S_E, S_D). This is a poor outcome.

4. Targeting P2 (School_B): To secure a better match, S_B must target their next best choice, School_B. School_B's priority list is [S_E, S_B, S_C, S_D, S_A]. S_B is the 2nd highest priority overall. If S_B applies to School_B in R1, and S_E applies to School_C (S_E P1), S_B has the highest priority among the applicants (S_B, S_C, S_D). 

5. R1 Simulation with S_B Strategizing (S_B submits [B, A, C, D, E], S_A submits [A, C, B, E, D]):
   - Applications: S_A -> H_A, S_B -> H_B, S_C -> H_B, S_D -> H_B, S_E -> H_C.
   - H_A chooses S_A (Match: S_A, H_A).
   - H_B receives {S_B, S_C, S_D}. H_B prefers S_B > S_C > S_D. H_B chooses S_B (Match: S_B, H_B).
   - H_C chooses S_E (Match: S_E, H_C).

In Round 3, the remaining students are A and D, and schools are D and E. Student D's highest remaining choice is School E. Student A's highest remaining choice is School D. The applications and identifications (D identifies D, E identifies A) form a closed loop: S_D -> E -> A -> D -> S_D. D is matched with School E.

School E is Rank 4 on Student D's list. Attempts to strategically misreport preferences (e.g., applying to A or D first) either resulted in the same Rank 4 outcome or a worse Rank 5 outcome (matching with School D).

School A receives only one application, from Student B. School A's priority list ranks Student B 4th (E, D, A, B, C). Since B is the highest priority applicant available, School A identifies Student B.

1. Analysis of Higher Preferences (B, C, A):
School B ranks Student A last (E > B > C > D > A). School C ranks Student A last (B > C > D > E > A). School A ranks Student A third (E > D > A > B > C). 

In Step 1, when all students submit their true preferences:
- School B identifies Student E (B->E).
- School C identifies Student B (C->B).
- School A identifies Student E (A->E).
Since higher priority students (E, B, D) are available, A is rejected by B and C, and School A identifies E, preventing A from matching with B, C, or A in early steps, regardless of where A applies.

2. Analysis of School E (Rank 4):
School E ranks Student A highest (A > C > B > E > D). If A applies to School E (A->E), and E identifies A (E->A), a closed loop A->E->A is formed immediately, guaranteeing a match (A, E) in Step 1, provided E is free. 

3. Simulation with True Preferences:
If I submit my true preferences ['B', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'D'], the loop B->A->E->C->B forms in R1, matching (B, A) and (E, C). Student A is left free. A continues proposing down the list until reaching E in R4, where A matches E (Rank 4).

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission: [B, C, A, E, D]):

2. Strategic Manipulation Check:
   I tested applying to my 2nd (C), 3rd (A), and 4th (E) choices in R1. In every scenario, the strong preferences and high priorities of other students (specifically C, D, and E) at my preferred schools (B, C, A) consistently resulted in the same early assignments (C/B, D/C, E/A).

Round 2: Students A, C, D apply to their highest remaining choice, School B (P1 for A, C, D). School B identifies Student C (R3 priority). A cycle forms: C -> B -> C. This results in M(C)=B. School B (P1) is filled.

Round 3: Students A and D remain. Schools D and E remain. My highest remaining preference is School_E (P4). Both A and D apply to E. School E identifies Student A (R1 priority). A cycle forms: A -> E -> A. This results in M(A)=E (P4).

Analysis of Strategic Misrepresentation:
To achieve a higher rank (B, C, or A), Student_A must displace students who block A at those schools (E, B, D). 
- School B (Rank 1): Blocked by E (P1) in R1 and D (P4) in R2. A is P5 at B. A cannot overcome this priority deficit.
- School C (Rank 2): Blocked by E (P4) in R1 cycle. A is P5 at C. A cannot overcome this.
- School A (Rank 3): Blocked by E (P1) in R1 identification, leading B (P4) to secure the spot via the cycle. A is P3 at A. A cannot overcome E's priority.

Since A cannot achieve Rank 1, 2, or 3, Rank 4 (School E) is the highest achievable outcome. Submitting the true preference list ensures A applies to E before D in R3, guaranteeing the Rank 4 outcome.

1. Step 1 Applications (Truthful P_B = [A, B, C, D, E]): S_B applies to School_A. S_E applies to School_C.
2. Step 1 Identifications: School_A identifies S_E (1st priority). School_C identifies S_B (1st priority).
3. Closed Loop: The chain $S_B \xrightarrow{A} H_A \xrightarrow{I} S_E \xrightarrow{A} H_C \xrightarrow{I} S_B$ forms a closed loop. Since S_B is involved, S_B is matched permanently with the school they applied to, H_A (Rank 1).

Since this yields the optimal outcome (Rank 1), deviation is unnecessary. Simulation of deviations (applying to School_B or School_C first) showed worse outcomes (Rank 2 and Rank 3, respectively), confirming that submitting the truthful preference list is the optimal strategy in this environment.",True,School_A,False,True,1

Round 1:
Applications: S_A->B, S_B->A, S_C->B, S_D->B, S_E->C.
Identifications (based on full priority list): H_A identifies S_E, H_B identifies S_E, H_C identifies S_B, H_D identifies S_D, H_E identifies S_A.

2. Targeting School_C (Rank 2): School_C prioritizes Student_B, Student_C, and then Student_D (D is 3rd). In Round 1, if I submit School_C first, I apply to C. The other applicant to C is Student_E (True preference Rank 1). School_C's priority list: D (Rank 3) > E (Rank 4).

1. Analysis of higher ranks (R1, R2, R3):
   - School B (R1) ranks Student_A lowest (P5). If A submits truthfully (B first), R1 matching results in (B, A) and (E, C) matches, leaving B open. In R2, A, C, and D apply to B. School B prioritizes C (P3) over D (P4) and A (P5). Thus, C secures B, pushing A down.

1. Analyze the outcome of submitting the True Preference List (TPL):

   School_B's Priority List (P_B): [E, B, C, D, A].

1. **Truthful Simulation:** If D submits [B, C, A, E, D], Step 1 results in a cycle: B matches A, E matches C. Schools A and C are filled. D is rejected by B.
2. In Step 2, students A, C, D apply to B. School B prioritizes C over D. C matches B. School B is filled. D is rejected.
3. In Step 3, D applies to E (rank 4) and A applies to D. A final cycle results in D matching School E.

This outcome (School E, rank 4) is the baseline.

4. **Strategic Deviation Analysis:** D's top choices (B, C, A) are consistently taken by higher priority students (E, B, C) in Steps 1 and 2. School A and C are filled in Step 1. School B is filled by Student C in Step 2 because C has higher priority at B than D (C is 3rd, D is 4th). Since D cannot alter the preferences or priorities of other agents, and since the crucial matches filling B, C, and A are robust against D's application direction, no strategic deviation (e.g., applying to A, C, or E first) improves D's rank beyond 4. Deviating to apply to School D first results in a worse outcome (Rank 5).

2. Attempt to secure Rank 1 (School B) or Rank 2 (School C).
   School C (R2) is taken by Student E in R1, as E applies to C and C identifies E (E is C's 4th priority, A is 5th). C is unavailable.

1. Analyze the outcome if I submit my True Preferences (School_B first):

1. True Preference Submission Outcome: If Student D submits truthfully ([B, C, A, E, D]), D applies to School B (P1). However, Student C also applies to B and has higher priority (C is R3, D is R4 at B). C gets B. D is left for later rounds and eventually matches with School A (P3).

2. Targeting School B (P1): School B is blocked by Student C in Round 1, as C applies to B and has higher priority than D. D cannot strategically prevent C from applying to B or being matched elsewhere efficiently.

3. Targeting School C (P2): Student D has relatively high priority at School C (R3). The main competitor applying to C in Round 1 is Student E (P1=C). Crucially, D has higher priority than E at School C (D is R3, E is R4). 

4. Strategic Submission: By submitting School C as the first choice ([C, B, A, E, D]), D ensures an application to C in Round 1. Both D and E apply to C.

3. Simulation with strategic submission [A, B, C, E, D]: In Round 1, A applies to A, and B applies to A. School A identifies A. Since A applied to A and A identified A, a direct closed loop match (A, A) is formed immediately.

Since D is consistently blocked by higher priority students (E, C, B, A) at their top choices (B, C, A, E), and those students are matched elsewhere, D is pushed down to School D, where D has the highest priority (Rank 1).

School identifications lead to a robust closed loop: E applies to C, C identifies B, B applies to A, A identifies E. This results in matches (B, A) and (E, C). This outcome is independent of A's application target, as A cannot influence School A's priority list ($R_A$) or Student E's availability.

I first simulated the outcome assuming all students (including myself) submit their True Preference Lists (TPL).

1. R1 (TPL): A closed loop forms involving E->School C and B->School A. Matches: (E, C) and (B, A). Student D remains unmatched.
2. R2: Remaining students A, C, D all apply to School B (their top remaining choice). School B prioritizes C (Rank 3) over D (Rank 4). Match: (C, B).
3. R3: Remaining students A, D apply to School E. School E prioritizes A (Rank 1) over D (Rank 5). Match: (A, E).
4. R4: Student D matches with School D (Rank 5).

This outcome (D matching School D) is the worst possible rank on my TPL.

I then analyzed strategic manipulation. To get a better rank (B, C, or A), I would need to displace E, B, C, or A from their matches. However, the R1 matches (E, C) and (B, A) are driven by a robust loop based on the applications of E and B, and the IDs of C and A, which D cannot disrupt. Furthermore, D is dominated in priority for School B (by C) and School E (by A).

Since Student D is dominated in priority for all schools higher than D, strategic misrepresentation (e.g., applying to A or C first) does not alter the final outcome of D matching School D.
