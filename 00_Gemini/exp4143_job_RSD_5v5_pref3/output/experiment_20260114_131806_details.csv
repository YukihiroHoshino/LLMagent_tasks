In SD, a seeker is assigned to the highest-ranked company on their list that has not yet reached its quota (which is 1 for all companies here).

1. Company A is my highest preference (Rank 1). Crucially, I am the only seeker who ranks Company A first. This gives me a unique advantage. If I am early in the serial order, listing Company A first guarantees I secure my top choice. I must not misrepresent Company A's position.

2. Analyzing Backups (C, D, B): If Company A is taken by a competitor (which happens if I am late in the order and competitors miss their own top choices), I must secure the next best available company. My true preferences rank them C (Rank 2) > D (Rank 3) > B (Rank 4). 

3. Strategic Consideration: Misrepresenting C, D, or B (e.g., listing D before C) would only be beneficial if prioritizing D increases the overall probability of securing a match, or if it avoids a scenario where I waste my turn applying for C only to find it taken, and then D is subsequently taken by a seeker who comes after me. However, since the SD mechanism always assigns me to the highest available company on my list, and I cannot predict which of C, D, or B will remain available, submitting my true ranking for these backups ensures that if multiple backups are available, I choose the one I truly prefer (C over D, D over B). 

4.
