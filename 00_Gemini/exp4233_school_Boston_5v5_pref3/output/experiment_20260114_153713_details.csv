1. Standard DA Analysis (Part 1):

1. Standard DA Simulation (Assuming all students report truthfully):

   - S_A applies to B, S_B applies to A, S_C applies to C, S_D applies to D, S_E applies to E.
   - Since all schools receive only one application, all students are temporarily admitted: M = {(S_A, H_B), (S_B, H_A), (S_C, H_C), (S_D, H_D), (S_E, H_E)}.
   - The process ends in Round 1.

2. Analyze the Blocking Student Correction (Part 2):
   - A student is a blocking student if their temporary admission differs from their final admission (Discrepancy criterion). Since the matching stabilized in Round 1, the temporary admission is the final admission for Part 1 for all students. 
   - Therefore, no blocking students are found, and the correction phase does not alter the outcome.

3. Optimal Outcome:
   - The resulting match for Student C is School C, which is the #1 choice on the True Preference List. Since this is the best possible outcome, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.",True,School_C,True,True,1

    - S_D proposes to School D.
    - S_E proposes to School E.
    Since all schools have a quota of 1 and each school receives exactly one application, all students are immediately admitted to their first choice. Student E is matched with School E (Rank 1).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Students):
    A blocking student only occurs if a student's temporary admission differs from their final admission. Since the matching stabilized in Round 1 (no rejections), the temporary admission is the final admission for all students. Therefore, no blocking students exist, and the procedure ends immediately after Part 1.

Therefore, the final outcome for Student_B is determined entirely by the initial execution of Part 1 based on the submitted list. To achieve the highest possible school on the True Preference List, Student_B must submit their true preferences, which are ['School_A', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_E', 'School_D'].",True,School_A,True,True,1

1. Analysis of Part 1 (DA) using True Preferences:
   - R1 Proposals: A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E.
   - Since each school receives only one proposal, all students are immediately accepted (A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E). 
   - The process stops in R1, resulting in the Part 1 Final Matching (M_DA).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Student Adjustment):
   - A blocking student must meet two conditions: 1) Prevention (temporary admission caused rejection) and 2) Discrepancy (temporary admission differs from final admission).
   - Since the matching was reached in R1 with no school receiving multiple proposals, no rejections occurred at any school. Therefore, Condition 1 (Prevention) is never met by any student.
   - Thus, there are no blocking students, and the M_DA is the Final Matching.

3. Conclusion:
   - My match under truthful submission is School C, which is my Rank 1 choice. Since I achieved my optimal outcome, no strategic deviation can improve my position. Submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.

I must confirm if the 'Blocking Student' check in Part 2 changes this strategy-proof nature.

Since I am Student E, and I have the lowest priority at every school (A > B > C > D > E), I must rely on the structure of DAA to secure the best possible position based on my truthful preferences.

In this specific case, Student_A is the highest priority student at every single school (A > B > C > D > E). Therefore, if Student_A applies to their Rank 1 choice, School_B, School_B will immediately and permanently admit Student_A, as no other student can displace A.

2. Analyze deviation: If Student D attempts to apply to a higher-ranked school on their TPL (A, C, or B) first, they will face higher-priority students who also prefer those schools (B prefers A, C prefers C, A prefers B). Due to D's low priority, D would be rejected from A, C, or B in Round 1 and would subsequently apply to School D in Round 2, securing the match with School D anyway.

3. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Students): Since the initial match (D, School D) is secured and no student moves to a different school during Part 1, the temporary admissions are equal to the final admissions.

4. The process stops after Round 1, resulting in the final stable matching M* where Student D is matched with School D (Rank 1).
5. Since the matching is reached in Round 1 without any rejections or subsequent movements, the temporary admissions equal the final admissions. Consequently, no 'blocking students' (Part 2) are created, and the matching is finalized immediately.

No student's temporary admission differed from their final admission, and no student caused a rejection (Prevention condition was not met).

Furthermore, Student_A holds the highest priority at every single high school (School_A through School_E). If Student_A applies to their top choice (School_B), School_B will immediately accept Student_A and hold the position, as no other student can displace Student_A.

Simulation of Part 1 (Truthful Reporting):
Student_A applies to School_B (Rank 1). Student_B applies to School_A. Student_C applies to School_C. Student_D applies to School_D. Student_E applies to School_E.
School_B accepts Student_A over Student_E due to higher priority. Student_A is tentatively matched with School_B.
Since Student_A achieves their Rank 1 choice and never moves, their temporary admission (School_B) equals their final admission (School_B) at the end of Part 1. Therefore, Student_A cannot be a 'blocking student' (Part 2), as the 'Discrepancy' condition is not met. The outcome (A matched with B) is stable and final. 

Thus, submitting the true preference list maximizes Student_A's outcome, securing the Rank 1 choice.",True,School_B,True,True,1

Student_A's True Preference List: ['School_B', 'School_A', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_E'].

Assuming all students submit their true preferences, we run Part 1:

If Student_C submits their true preferences ['School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A', 'School_D', 'School_E'], the initial round of proposals is: A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E.

Student_C matches with School_C, which is their Rank 1 choice.

3. Blocking Student Check (Part 2):

Since the goal is to achieve the best possible outcome for Student_B, submitting the true preference list remains the optimal strategy.

Verification via Simulation (using true preferences):
Round 1 Applications:
Student A -> School B
Student B -> School A
Student C -> School C
Student D -> School D
Student E -> School E

The DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing agents (students), meaning submitting true preferences guarantees the best possible stable match for the student. My goal is to maximize the rank of the matched school based on my True Preference List: ['School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A', 'School_D', 'School_E'].

1. Simulate DA with all students submitting their true preferences:
   Round 1: A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E.
   Since all schools receive only one application, all students are temporarily admitted: (A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).
   The process ends in Round 1, resulting in a stable match M.

2. Analyze the outcome for Student C: I am matched with School C, which is my rank #1 choice.

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Students):
   Since the matching stabilized immediately in Round 1 (M_T = M_F), there were no rejections caused by temporary admissions that later changed. The Discrepancy condition (temporary admission differs from final admission) is not met for any student. Thus, Part 2 does not alter the matching.

Since submitting my true preferences yields my rank #1 choice, this is the optimal strategy.",True,School_C,True,True,1

In standard DA, submitting the true preference list is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Students), guaranteeing the best stable match for the student.

Since I am Student_D, my goal is to maximize my outcome based on my True Preference List: ['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_E'].

1. Initial DA Run (Part 1): If all students submit their true lists, in Round 1:
    - A -> B, B -> A, C -> C, D -> D, E -> E.
    - Since all schools receive only one application, the match stabilizes immediately: D is matched with School_D (Rank 1).

2. Stability and Part 2: Achieving the Rank 1 choice is the absolute best outcome. Since the temporary admission (School_D) matches the final admission (School_D), I am not a 'blocking student' at any school, and the process ends immediately after Part 1 without any list modifications.

Submitting the true preference list guarantees the best possible outcome for Student_D (matching with School_D), regardless of the complexity introduced by Part 2, as the match stabilizes optimally in the first round.",True,School_D,True,True,1

This algorithm is known to be strategy-proof for students, meaning submitting the true preference list guarantees the student the best possible stable match (the student-optimal stable match).

1. Simulation using True Preferences:
   Round 1 Proposals:
   A -> School_B
   B -> School_A
   C -> School_C
   D -> School_D
   E -> School_E

   Since all schools receive only one application in Round 1, all students are temporarily admitted to their top choice: M_T = {(A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

2. Outcome Analysis:
   Student_E is matched to School_E, which is their Rank 1 choice.

3. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Students):
   Since the match M_T was reached in Round 1 with no rejections, no student was temporarily admitted and later moved (Discrepancy condition failed). Therefore, no blocking students are found, and M_T is the final stable match.

4. Conclusion:
   Submitting the true preference list yields the best possible outcome (Rank 1 School_E). Therefore, Student_E should submit the true preference list.",True,School_E,True,True,1
