3. Testing Strategic List P_A' = [D, C, A, B, E]: I chose to prioritize C_D (Rank 3) first to delay proposing to C_A until Round 3. This strategy aimed to allow highly competitive seekers (D and B) to be provisionally matched elsewhere before I proposed to C_A.

1. Analysis of Truthful Play (TP): If all agents submit their true preferences, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) process results in a matching where Seeker_E is matched with Company_D (Rank 4). This occurs because Seeker_E is rejected sequentially by Company_C (by Seeker_D), Company_B (by Seeker_B), and Company_A (by Seeker_A).

2. Stability Check and Strategic Anticipation: The truthful outcome is unstable because Seeker_D (D) prefers Company_A (C_A) over their match, and C_A prefers D over their matched seeker (A). D is highly incentivized to deviate strategically to C_A to improve their outcome (from Rank 4 to Rank 3). I assume D, being rational and having full information, will deviate (D_S: [C_A, C_C, C_B, C_E, C_D]).

3. Optimal Strategy given D's Deviation: If D applies to C_A first, D vacates their application spot at C_C in R1. If I apply truthfully (C_C first), C_C receives only my application (E) in R1 (since C is applying to C_D). C_C accepts E immediately.

2. Round 2: E proposes to C_B (Rank 2). C_B holds B. C_B receives proposal from E. C_B prefers B (Priority 3) over E (Priority 5). E is rejected.

1. True Submission Simulation: Submitting [C_C, C_B, C_A, C_D, C_E] resulted in a match with C_E (Rank 5). This is because I have very low priority (4th or 5th) at C_C, C_B, and C_A, leading to immediate rejection by higher-priority seekers (A, B, D) and leaving me with C_E.

1. Analysis of TPL submission: Simulating the Deferred Acceptance (DA) mechanism with all agents submitting their TPL shows that Seeker_D (D) ends up matched with Company_D (Rank 5). D is rejected early from R1 (C) by Seeker C, and from R2 (A) by Seeker B, due to lower priority.

2. Targeting Rank 1 (C) or Rank 2 (A): Company C highly prefers Seeker C (R1) over D (R3). Company A highly prefers Seeker B (R1) over D (R2). D cannot secure C or A because these higher-priority seekers will eventually apply and displace D.

First, analyzing E's priorities at all companies reveals that E has very low priority at the top choices: R4 at C_C, R5 at C_B, R4 at C_A. E's highest priority is R2 at Company_D. 

A simulation of truthful reporting (T_E = [C_C, C_B, C_A, C_D, C_E]) shows that E is rejected at every step and ends up unmatched (Rank 6).

Therefore, E must strategize. Since E has R2 priority at Company_D, proposing C_D first is the best way to secure a match, provided that Seeker_D (R1 at C_D) is matched elsewhere.

By setting the proposed list to S_E = [C_D, C_C, C_B, C_A, C_E] and simulating the DA process (assuming all others report truthfully):
1. R1: E proposes C_D. E (R2) wins against C (R3) who also proposes C_D. C is rejected.
2. R4: C is eventually rejected from C_A and C_B, and proposes C_C (P4), rejecting D (R3).
3. R5: D proposes C_A (P2), rejecting A (R3).
4. R10: B proposes C_A (P3), rejecting D (R2).
5. R11: D proposes C_E (P4) and is matched there.

This cascade ensures that D is matched to C_E (D's P4) before D reaches C_D (D's P5). Since D, the only seeker ranked higher than E at C_D, is matched elsewhere, E retains the seat at C_D. This yields a match with Company_D, which is Rank 4. Since E cannot defeat the R1/R2/R3 seekers at C_C, C_B, or C_A, Rank 4 is the optimal attainable outcome.",False,Company_D,True,False,4

1.  **Truthful Strategy Check:** If I submit my true preferences [D, A, B, C, E], the Deferred Acceptance algorithm simulation shows that I propose to D in R1. D accepts me temporarily, but in R4, D receives an application from Seeker_E (who has R2 priority, higher than my R3 priority) and rejects me. I eventually match with Company_E (Rank 5).

2.  **Strategic Deviation Analysis:** Since Rank 5 is the worst outcome, I look for a feasible match with a higher rank. Company_C (Rank 4) is the only company where I have Rank 1 priority. By submitting C first, I can secure this position immediately, preventing rejection.

3.  **Simulation of [C, D, A, B, E]:**
    *   In R1, I propose to C. Seekers D and E also propose to C. Since I have R1 priority at C, C accepts me and rejects D and E. Match: (C, C).

4.  **Conclusion:** Rank 4 (Company C) is superior to Rank 5 (Company E).

Although submitting true preferences is generally weakly dominant, strategic deviation can sometimes yield a better outcome if others submit their true preferences, especially if the resulting match is not the S-optimal stable match. 

1. Analysis of True Preferences: If all seekers submit their true preferences, simulation shows Seeker_E matches with Company_E (5th choice).
2. Analysis of Top Preferences (C, B, A): Seeker_E has low priority at these companies relative to the seekers who apply there in R1 (S_D at C_C, S_B at C_B, S_A at C_A). Since S_E is ranked 4th at C_C, 5th at C_B, and 4th at C_A, securing these spots is highly unlikely, as the R1 applicants (S_D, S_B, S_A) have higher priority or are only displaced by seekers with even higher priority.
3. Analysis of Company_D (4th choice): At Company_D, S_E is ranked 2nd [S_D, S_E, S_C, S_B, S_A]. The 1st priority seeker, S_D, applies to C_C first. The only other seeker applying to C_D in R1 based on true preferences is S_C. S_E has higher priority than S_C at C_D (S_E > S_C).
4. Strategic Decision: By placing Company_D first in my Choice Ranking List, I ensure I apply to C_D in Round 1. Since S_D is applying to C_C (and is later busy securing C_A/C_B), and S_E beats S_C at C_D, S_E secures C_D in R1. This outcome (C_D, 4th choice) is strictly better than the outcome achieved by submitting true preferences (C_E, 5th choice).
