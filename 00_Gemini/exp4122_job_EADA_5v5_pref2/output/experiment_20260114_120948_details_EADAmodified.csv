A fundamental result in matching theory is that submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing agents (Job Seekers) in JSP-DA, guaranteeing they receive the best possible stable match available to them. 

1. Analysis of S-Optimal Stable Matching (M_True):
If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_B (S_B) secures Company_E (C_E) due to high priority (2nd) at C_E, displacing Seeker_A (S_A) and Seeker_D (S_D). S_A then matches with Company_B (C_B), and S_D matches with Company_A (C_A). This match (S_D, C_A) is the highest ranked company on Seeker_D's true list that is part of the resulting stable matching (C_A is 2nd choice).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers):
Since the outcome of Part 1 (M_True) is a stable matching, no seeker who was temporarily admitted at a company later moves away from it (they are not displaced by a higher-priority applicant). Specifically, S_B stays at C_E, and thus S_B does not meet the criteria for being a 'blocking Job Seeker' at C_E.

Part 1 Simulation:
Round 1 Applications:
S_A, S_B, S_D apply to C_E. S_C applies to C_D. S_E applies to C_C.
Round 1 Admissions:
C_E admits S_B (highest priority among S_A, S_B, S_D). S_A and S_D are rejected.
C_D admits S_C.
C_C admits S_E.

Round 2 Applications:

Round 2 Admissions:
C_B admits S_A. C_A admits S_D.

Final Matches (End of Part 1): S_C is matched with C_D (Rank 1).

In the standard DA algorithm where job seekers propose, submitting truthful preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the seekers, guaranteeing the best possible stable match for the seeker (the Seeker-Optimal stable matching, M_stable).

1. Identify the Seeker-Optimal Stable Matching (M_stable) using truthful preferences (TPL).
   A's TPL: ['Company_E', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_A', 'Company_C'].
   Company E prefers Seeker B (Q2) over Seeker A (Q3). Since B also prefers E (P1), B will secure E, preventing A from getting Rank 1.
   In the simulation of DA (Part 1) using truthful preferences, A is rejected by E and then proposes to B, where A is accepted (B prefers A, Q1).
   The resulting stable matching (M_stable) is: A->B, B->E, C->D, D->A, E->C. Seeker_A achieves Company B (Rank 2).

2. Analyze the Blocking Rule (Part 2).
   A blocking seeker is defined as someone who was temporarily admitted (TA) at C, caused others to be rejected (Prevention), but then moved away from C (Discrepancy). In M_stable, no agent moves after receiving their first temporary admission (or final admission) because the process terminates when no one is rejected/moves.

First, I analyzed the market to see if my Rank 1 choice, Company E, is attainable. Company E's priority list is (E > B > A > D > C). Seeker B also ranks E first. Since Company E prefers Seeker B over Seeker A, and B will propose to E in the first round, Seeker A will be rejected by E. Therefore, Company E is unattainable.

Next, I focused on my Rank 2 choice, Company B. Company B's priority list ranks Seeker A first (A > B > C > E > D). If Seeker A applies to Company B, A is guaranteed the position unless A is already matched to a higher ranked choice.

1. Calculate the stable match (M) assuming all seekers submit their true preferences (P). The result of the DAA simulation is: A->B, B->C, C->D, D->E, E->A. Seeker_A is matched with Company_B (2nd choice).

2. Stability Check: Seeker_D prefers Company_E (Rank 1) over Company_A (Rank 2). However, Company_E prefers its partner Seeker_B (2nd priority) over Seeker_D (4th priority). Thus, (D, E) is not a blocking pair, and D cannot achieve E in any stable matching.

1. Initial Analysis (Part 1 with True Preferences): I simulated the DA algorithm using the true preference lists of all seekers. Seeker_A (S_A) proposes to C_E (Rank 1). C_E receives proposals from S_A, S_B, and S_D. Since S_B has higher priority at C_E than S_A, S_B secures C_E. S_A is rejected and proposes to C_B (Rank 2).

1. **Truthful Submission Analysis (Part 1):** If Seeker_D submits the true list ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C'], in Round 1, Company_E receives applications from S_A, S_B, and S_D. Company_E prioritizes S_B (2nd) over S_A (3rd) and S_D (4th). S_B is temporarily admitted, and S_A and S_D are rejected.

2. **Manipulation Check:** Since Company_E is taken by S_B (who is higher priority and ranks C_E as P1) regardless of S_D's R1 application strategy, S_D cannot achieve C_E. Any attempt to rank a lower company first would either result in the same match (C_A) or a worse match (e.g., C_B or C_C, which S_D would get in R1, preventing S_D from applying to C_A).

3. **Part 2 Check:** The resulting stable match (S_D <-> C_A) does not involve any blocking job seekers, as S_B (the only seeker who caused rejections) remained matched with the company where they caused the rejections (C_E). Furthermore, the rules state that Part 2 waivers will never change my final admission from Part 1.

1. Determine the Seeker-Optimal Stable Matching (M_S) using True Preference Lists (TPLs):
   - S_A TPL: [E, B, D, A, C].
   - In Round 1, S_A, S_B, and S_D apply to C_E. C_E prefers S_B (2nd) > S_A (3rd) > S_D (4th). C_E admits S_B, rejecting S_A and S_D.
   - S_A subsequently applies to C_B (2nd choice). C_B ranks S_A 1st and admits S_A.
   - The resulting stable matching M_S is: {(S_A, C_B), (S_B, C_E), (S_C, C_D), (S_D, C_A), (S_E, C_C)}. S_A is matched to C_B, which is Rank 2 on S_A's TPL.

2. Analyze the BJS rule impact:
   - Since all matches in M_S result from temporary admissions that were finalized (no seeker moved away from a temporary admission), there are no Blocking Job Seekers in this stable outcome. Part 2 does not trigger.

3. Evaluate strategic deviation:
   - Since S_A cannot achieve C_E (Rank 1) even by proposing truthfully (because S_B has higher priority at C_E and also prefers C_E), and the DAA guarantees the best stable outcome for the proposer, strategic manipulation of the list is highly unlikely to yield a better result (C_E) while maintaining stability relative to the underlying preferences. Furthermore, deviation often risks matching with a worse company (e.g., proposing C_D first led to C_D, Rank 3).

1. Determining the Stable Matching (M): If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_B is preferred over Seeker_A by Company_E (E priorities: B > A). Since B also prefers E most, B will secure E. Seeker_A will be rejected by E and apply to Company_B (Rank 2). Company_B prefers A over all other applicants in that round.

2. Analyzing Manipulation Potential: Since B secures their Rank 1 choice (E) by reporting truthfully, B has no incentive to deviate. Thus, A cannot obtain E.

Temporary Matches: (B, S_A), (A, S_D).

Final Matching: M = {(A, S_D), (B, S_A), (C, S_E), (D, S_C), (E, S_B)}.

Seeker_C is matched with Company_D, which is Rank 1 on the preference list. Since this is the highest possible outcome, strategic misrepresentation is unnecessary and risky. 

Furthermore, I verified that no blocking job seekers are created in this outcome (Part 2 does not trigger a rerun) because the only temporary admission that caused rejections (S_B at C_E) resulted in S_B's final match being C_E.

2. **Analyze Competition for Rank 1 (Company E):** Seekers A and B also list E first. Company E's priority list (Q_E) is Seeker E > Seeker B > Seeker A > Seeker D. Since B and A are prioritized above D, D will be rejected by E in Round 1 if A and B apply truthfully.

1. Analyze the stable matching outcome (Part 1):
By running the DA algorithm assuming all seekers submit their true preferences, I determine the seeker-optimal stable match. 
*   Company_E (my 1st choice) prioritizes S_E > S_B > S_A > S_D. Since S_B proposes C_E first and is ranked 2nd, S_B secures C_E over me (ranked 4th). 
*   I am rejected by C_E in Round 1 and propose C_A (my 2nd choice) in Round 2. 
*   Company_A prioritizes S_B > S_D > S_A > S_C > S_E. Since S_B is matched at C_E, I am the highest available priority seeker for C_A when I propose, securing the match. 
*   The resulting stable match is M = { (S_A, C_B), (S_B, C_E), (S_C, C_D), (S_D, C_A), (S_E, C_C) }. My outcome is C_A (2nd choice).

2. Assess strategic deviation:
Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof for seekers (it guarantees the best stable match for the seeker), manipulation to achieve a better outcome (C_E) is generally impossible, especially since the market has a unique stable match (due to unit capacities). Simulations confirming deviation attempts still resulted in C_A.

3. Assess Part 2 impact:
Part 2 only modifies the lists of 'blocking seekers' and reruns Part 1. In the stable matching derived from true preferences, there are no blocking seekers (seekers who caused rejection but then moved away), as all temporary admissions that caused rejections (e.g., S_B at C_E) resulted in final admissions at the same company.

1. Standard DA Strategy: In standard DA, submitting true preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing side (Seekers). I will first simulate the outcome if all agents submit their true preferences.

2. Simulation (Part 1, True Preferences): 
   - Round 1: S_C applies to C_D. C_D receives only S_C and temporarily admits S_C. S_A, S_B, S_D apply to C_E. C_E admits S_B, rejecting S_A and S_D. S_E applies to C_C, admitted.
   - Round 2: S_A applies to C_B. S_D applies to C_A. Both are admitted.
   - Final Match M: {(S_A, C_B), (S_B, C_E), (S_C, C_D), (S_D, C_A), (S_E, C_C)}.

1. Initial JS-DA run (using all agents' True Preferences):
   - Seeker A applies to Company E (1st choice).
   - Company E receives applications from A, B, and D. E prioritizes B (2nd) > A (3rd) > D (4th). E provisionally holds B, rejecting A and D.
   - In subsequent rounds, A applies to B (2nd choice) and is provisionally held by B. D applies to A and is provisionally held by A.
   - The resulting stable matching (M_S) is: (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C).
   - Seeker A matches with Company B (2nd choice).

2. Analysis of the Blocking Job Seeker Rule (Part 2):
   - For Part 2 to trigger, a seeker must have been temporarily admitted (TA) at Company C, caused rejections, but ultimately matched elsewhere (M_T != C).
   - In M_S, every seeker's final match equals their last temporary admission (TA=M_T) because the procedure ended without further rejections or displacements. Therefore, no blocking job seekers are created, and Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

3. Strategic Consideration:
   - Since Company B has higher priority than A for Company E, A cannot obtain E unless B is diverted. Since B is rational and prefers E over all other companies, B will submit E first. 
   - Submitting any list other than the TPL risks a worse outcome (e.g., matching with D, A, or C, or remaining unmatched) without improving the chance of securing E.

In the simulation using true preferences, all temporary admissions became final admissions (e.g., S_B was temporarily admitted at C_E and finally matched with C_E; S_D was temporarily admitted at C_A and finally matched with C_A).

1. Round 1: Seekers A, B, D propose to Company E. Company E accepts Seeker B (highest priority). Seekers A and D are rejected.
2. Round 2: Seeker D proposes to Company A (2nd choice). Company A accepts Seeker D.

I first simulated the standard DA algorithm using the true preferences of all agents to determine the stable matching outcome (Part 1 outcome):

Round 1: E applied to C, C accepted E. B applied to E, E accepted B (rejecting A, D). C applied to D, D accepted C.
Round 2: A applied to B, B accepted A. D applied to A, A accepted D.

The resulting stable matching is M = {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}.

In this outcome, Seeker E is matched with Company C, which is my 1st choice. Since I achieved my top preference, I cannot improve my outcome by strategic misreporting.

I analyze the outcome of the Seeker-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) using the full market information, as this mechanism usually incentivizes truthful revelation.

1. Standard DAA Simulation (Using True Preferences):
   - Round 1 applications: A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C.
   - Company E admits B (highest priority among A, B, D). A and D are rejected.
   - Round 2 applications: A->B, D->A.
   - Company B admits A (A is 1st priority at B).
   - Company A admits D (D is 2nd priority at A).
   - The resulting matching M1 is: (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C).

2. Outcome Analysis:
   - Seeker A is matched to Company B, which is my 2nd choice.
   - Company E (my 1st choice) is unreachable because Seeker B has higher priority at E and applies there (B is 2nd priority at E, A is 3rd). Since B receives E, A cannot obtain E.

3. Stability and Part 2 Check:
   - M1 is verified to be stable. Since M1 is stable and Part 1 ended because no seeker was rejected, the temporary admissions match the final admissions (no seeker moved later). Thus, no 'Blocking Job Seekers' are found, and M1 is the final outcome.

4. Strategic Consideration:
   - Since Company E is unattainable, Company B is the best possible outcome (Rank 2). In DAA, truthful revelation is a weakly dominant strategy.

I will first determine the outcome assuming truthful submission (T_D = ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C']).

1. Check for Rank 1 (Company E): E prefers Seeker B (Rank 2) and Seeker A (Rank 3) over Seeker D (Rank 4). Since both A and B prefer E and propose to E in Round 1, D cannot obtain E.

2. Check for Rank 2 (Company A): A prefers Seeker B (Rank 1) over Seeker D (Rank 2). If B matches elsewhere, D can obtain A.

Running DA with True Preferences:
Round 1: A, B, D propose E. C proposes D. E proposes C. E accepts B (rejects A, D). D accepts C. C accepts E. 
Round 2: A (rejected) proposes B. D (rejected) proposes A. B accepts A (Rank 1 at B). A accepts D (Rank 2 at A).

Since Seeker_E secures their 1st choice (Company_C) immediately and this match persists until the end of Part 1, Seeker_E achieves the optimal outcome possible.

Seeker A's match is Company B, which is rank 2 on the True Preference List ['Company_E', 'Company_B', ...]. Company E (rank 1) is unattainable because Seeker B has higher priority at Company E.

Since the resulting matching M is stable, there is no conflict between temporary and final admissions (M(S)=T(S)). Therefore, no blocking Job Seekers are found in Part 2, and the procedure terminates with M.

3. The DA process (Part 1) concludes when no seeker is rejected, resulting in the matching M_P1 = {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}. Seeker B is matched with Company E (Rank 1).
4. I check Part 2 (Blocking Job Seekers). A seeker is blocking if they caused rejections at a company but eventually moved away. Seeker B caused rejections at Company E, but B's final match (E) is the same as the temporary admission. Therefore, B is not a blocking seeker.
