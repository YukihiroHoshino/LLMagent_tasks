1. Identify the goal: Maximize the rank of the matched school on Student_B's True Preference List: ['School_B' (R1), 'School_D' (R2), 'School_A' (R3), 'School_E' (R4), 'School_C' (R5)].

2. Analyze competition for top choices:
    *   School_B (R1): Only Student_E ranks it 2nd. No other student ranks it 1st.
    *   School_D (R2): Student_C ranks it 1st. It is highly likely Student_C will claim this spot if called before Student_B.
    *   School_A (R3): Student_A ranks it 1st, and Students C/D rank it 2nd. It is highly likely to be taken by someone else.

3. Determine the optimal strategy:
    *   Since Student_B's top choice, School_B, is not the top choice of any other student, listing School_B first maximizes the chances of securing the Rank 1 outcome, especially if Student_B receives an early serial order. If Student_B listed a lower-ranked school first (e.g., School_D or School_A), and B was called first, B would unnecessarily settle for a suboptimal match (Rank 2 or 3).
    *   Schools D and A are highly contested by students who rank them 1st or 2nd. Even if Student_B ranked them higher than School_B, B cannot guarantee securing them against A or C/D. Therefore, strategic misrepresentation by swapping R1 (School_B) with R2 (School_D) or R3 (School_A) would only reduce B's best possible outcome (if B is called early).
    *   In the worst-case scenario (B is called last), the most popular schools (A, C, D, and likely B, taken by E) will be gone, leaving B with School_E (R4). No strategic reordering of the top three schools can prevent this worst-case outcome.

If Student_C is called early (1st, 2nd, or 3rd), School_D is highly likely to be available because D is not the highest preference for any other student (S_A prefers A, S_B prefers B, S_D and S_E prefer C). Truthful reporting guarantees School_D (Rank 1) in these scenarios.

The worst outcome occurs if Student_C is called late (e.g., 5th) and all higher preference schools are taken. We identified a specific permutation (S_A, S_B, S_D, S_E, S_C) where S_A takes A, S_B takes B, S_D takes C, and S_E takes D (since C, B, A are gone, D is S_E's 4th choice and available).
