Seeker_E has applied multiple times and been rejected, indicating Company_A has been holding out for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_A). Given the high round number (6) and the fact that Company_A is the last capacity remaining, it is highly probable that all higher-ranked seekers on Company_A's priority list are now matched elsewhere.\n\nSince Company_A's priority list ranks Seeker_E 4th, and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices are likely gone, Seeker_E should now be Company_A's best available option. I must submit a final, strong application ([APPLY]), emphasizing the market dynamics and offering a stable, immediate match to overcome their historical reluctance."

Although Seeker_E argues the market is reaching its final stage, it is only Round 6. Accepting a Rank #4 candidate now would prevent me from matching with my top 3 priorities, who may still be available and considering their options, or whose preferred companies (Company_B, Company_C, Company_D) might reject them soon, leading them back to Company_A. I must maintain my high standards and reject Seeker_E again, sticking to the strategy of prioritizing specialized alignment."

Since we are in Round 7 and Company_A is the last one standing, it is logically certain that those higher-ranked candidates are now matched elsewhere.
