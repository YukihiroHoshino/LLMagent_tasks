It is Round 4, and I have rejected Seeker_A (R3) three times previously. Seeker_A is highly persistent and ranks me as their top choice. In this round's inbox, Seeker_A (R3) is the highest priority candidate applying, followed by Seeker_E (R4). While Seeker_B and Seeker_D are preferred, continuing to wait risks losing Seeker_A, who might move on to their second choice (Company_C) after repeated rejections. Securing a Rank 3 match in Round 4 is a strong outcome, safeguarding against remaining unmatched or settling for a lower rank later. I will accept Seeker_A."
