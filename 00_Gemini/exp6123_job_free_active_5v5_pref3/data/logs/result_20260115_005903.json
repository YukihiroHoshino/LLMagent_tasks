Seeker_E is ranked 4th. I have one quota remaining and Seeker_E has submitted an [APPLY] tag.\n\nThe higher-ranked candidates (A, C, B) all list Company_E as their lowest or second-to-lowest preference, and they have strong mutual interest with other companies (e.g., C with Company_C, B with Company_A). Given that it is Round 4 and none of the top 3 have initiated contact, it is highly likely they are matched or pursuing better options.\n\nSeeker_E applying now suggests they have exhausted their preferred options (C, B, A, D). Accepting Seeker_E guarantees filling my quota with the 4th priority candidate, which is preferable to risking an unmatched status while waiting for candidates who are unlikely to choose me. I will proceed with acceptance."
