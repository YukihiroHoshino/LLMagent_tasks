Since this is Round 1, I have not yet heard from my P1 (Seeker_B) or P2 (Seeker_D) candidates, who are likely pursuing their own top choices (Seeker_B prefers Company_B, Seeker_D prefers Company_C). Accepting Seeker_A (P3) now locks my quota, preventing me from matching with Seeker_B or Seeker_D if they become available next round. Given that Seeker_A is ranked low by their second choice (Company_C ranks Seeker_A P5), there is a reasonable chance Seeker_A might return if they are rejected elsewhere.
