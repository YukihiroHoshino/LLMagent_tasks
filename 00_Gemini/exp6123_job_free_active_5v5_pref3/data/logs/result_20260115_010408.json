I will initiate the process by formally applying to Company_C (Rank 1). \nCompany_C's priority list places me (Seeker_D) at rank 3, behind Seeker_C and Seeker_B. While I am not their top choice, in Round 1, it is standard strategy to apply to the top preference and see the outcome. Based on the likely moves of other seekers (who often target their own top choices: A->A, B->B, C->D), Company_C might receive applications from me and possibly Seeker_E (who also ranks C first). If only Seeker_E and I apply, Company_C prefers me (D is rank 3, E is rank 4). Therefore, applying to Company_C maximizes my chance of securing my top choice immediately."

My top two priorities, Seeker_C (P1) and Seeker_B (P2), rank me very low (4th and 5th respectively), meaning they are unlikely to apply in early rounds, or perhaps at all if they match with higher preferences. Accepting Seeker_D secures a highly motivated candidate who ranks high on my list, minimizing the risk of ending up with no match or a much lower priority match (like Seeker_A). Given the strong preference alignment and the high risk associated with waiting for candidates who don't prefer me, I will accept Seeker_D."
