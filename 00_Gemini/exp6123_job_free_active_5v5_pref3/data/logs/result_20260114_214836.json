If I apply to my Rank 1 choice (Company_C), I compete against S_D, whom C_C prefers (S_D is 3rd, I am 4th). I will be rejected, and since all other companies will be matched, I will be left only with Company_E (my Rank 5) in Round 2.\n\nTo avoid the worst-case scenario (Rank 5), I must secure a match in R1 where I am the preferred candidate among the applicants. My Rank 4 choice, Company_D, is currently targeted by S_C (S_C's Rank 1). However, Company_D ranks me (S_E) as 2nd best, and S_C as 3rd best. Since S_D (C_D's Rank 1) is applying elsewhere (C_C), if I apply to C_D, I become the highest priority applicant (Rank 2) competing against S_C (Rank 3). This guarantees acceptance by C_D, securing a Rank 4 outcome, which is better than the expected Rank 5 outcome if I pursue C_C unsuccessfully."
