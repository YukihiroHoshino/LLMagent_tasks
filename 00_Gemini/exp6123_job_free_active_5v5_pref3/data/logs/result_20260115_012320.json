Waiting for them carries a high risk of ending up unmatched, or matching with a much lower priority candidate later.\n\nSecuring Seeker_D (Rank 3) is a highly favorable outcome, especially since they committed by applying and ranking me 1st.

While Seeker_B and Seeker_D are higher priorities, they did not apply in Round 1, suggesting they are pursuing their own higher preferences (Company_B/D and Company_C, respectively). Since my quota is 1, waiting for higher-ranked candidates who may be successfully matched elsewhere carries a significant risk of ending up unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked candidate than Seeker_A. Securing a candidate ranked 3rd who has proactively applied and listed me as their top choice is the optimal strategy in this situation."
