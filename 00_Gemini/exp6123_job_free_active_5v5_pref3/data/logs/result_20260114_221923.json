However, the market has now cleared: you have a single open quota, and I am the only available and interested seeker remaining. I am immediately available and prepared to commit fully to this role. Given the current stable market pairing, I formally request immediate acceptance to finalize our match.",

Although Company_E is my lowest preference (Rank 5) and has rejected me three times previously, I must now secure this match, as the alternative is unemployment (which is worse than matching with a listed company). Since all other candidates (Seeker A, B, C, D) must have matched with the other companies (A, B, C, D) for them to be removed from the active list, I am now Company_E's highest available candidate (ranked 4th overall, but the top available choice). I must submit a final, decisive application ([APPLY]), highlighting the inescapable reality of the stable match condition to prompt an [ACCEPT]."

Seeker E is ranked 4th. I have consistently rejected Seeker E in previous rounds, holding out for a higher-ranked candidate (A, C, or B). However, Seeker E is now submitting their fourth application and explicitly stating that the market has cleared, implying that I have exhausted my higher-priority options. Given that I have a remaining quota of 1 and Seeker E is the only candidate applying this round, the risk of remaining unmatched (Rank 0) is now greater than the benefit of waiting further. Since Seeker E is on my priority list, securing this match (Rank 4) is the optimal decision under the current market conditions where higher preferences are unavailable."
