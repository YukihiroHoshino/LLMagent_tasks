Analyze competitors' preferences:\n    *   Seeker_D ranks Company_D last (5th). They are likely applying elsewhere (e.g., Company_C or Company_A).\n    *   Seeker_E ranks Company_D 4th. They are likely applying elsewhere (e.g., Company_C or Company_B).\n3. Conclusion for Round 1: It is highly probable that the two seekers ranked above me at Company_D will propose to their higher preferences.
