Given the current dynamics of the market and after a final review of our strategic needs, we recognize the value you bring and the immediate availability you offer. We are pleased to formally offer you the position. Welcome to Company_E.",

I have previously rejected Seeker_E twice (after an initial [TALK] response). Seeker_E is now applying again in Round 6, explicitly stating that Company_E is the 'last remaining opportunity in this cycle' and that the market is 'settling.' This strongly suggests that my higher priority candidates (A, C, B) have either matched with their preferred companies or have chosen not to apply to Company_E, despite my previous rejections of Seeker_E to hold out for them. Given the late stage of the process and the high risk of ending up with no match or only my lowest priority candidate (Seeker_D), securing a match with my 4th priority candidate (Seeker_E) is the prudent decision now. I will accept Seeker_E."
