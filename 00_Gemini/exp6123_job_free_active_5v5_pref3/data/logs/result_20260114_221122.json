Analyzing P2/P3 (Company_B/Company_A): I am ranked 5th/4th respectively, and their higher-ranked P1 applicants (S_B/S_A) will secure those slots.\n3. Analyzing P4 (Company_D): Company_D's priority list is ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_A']. I am ranked 2nd by Company_D.\n4. Strategic Opportunity: Company_D's top choice, Seeker_D, is applying to Company_C (S_D's P1). The next highest-ranked applicant who is targeting D is Seeker_C (S_C's P1), who is ranked 3rd by D. If I apply to Company_D, I become D's highest available applicant (2nd preferred), displacing Seeker_C (3rd preferred).
