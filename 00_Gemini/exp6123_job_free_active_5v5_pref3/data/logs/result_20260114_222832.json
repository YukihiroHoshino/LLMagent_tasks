I have consistently rejected S_A (Rank 3) hoping for S_B or S_D. However, S_D is the top priority for both Company_B and Company_D, making it highly probable they are already matched. S_B is also highly desired. If I continue to reject S_A, who has C_A as their top choice and is applying persistently, I risk S_A matching with their next best option (C_C or C_B, where C_B ranks S_A highly at #2). Since S_A is my Rank 3 and the best available candidate actively applying, securing this match now minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked candidate (S_E or S_C) or remaining unmatched. I will accept S_A."
