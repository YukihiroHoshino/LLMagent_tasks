Securing a Rank 3 match immediately, especially one where the seeker is highly committed (Rank 1 for them), is a very stable and desirable outcome, minimizing the risk of ending the simulation unmatched or forced to take a lower-ranked candidate later. While Seeker_C and Seeker_B are preferred, waiting for them carries the risk of losing Seeker_D to another company (e.g., Company_A where D is Rank 2). Given the competitive environment and my limited quota, accepting Seeker_D now is the optimal strategy."
