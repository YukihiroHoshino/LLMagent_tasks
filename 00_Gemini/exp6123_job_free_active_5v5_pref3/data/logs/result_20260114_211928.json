Company_D (My #4): I am Company_D's 2nd highest priority. Seeker_C (D's #3 pick, C's #1 preference) will certainly apply here.\n\nSince I rank higher (2nd) than the likely strongest competitor (Seeker_C, ranked 3rd) at Company_D, applying to Company_D guarantees an acceptance in Round 1, securing my 4th preferred option.
