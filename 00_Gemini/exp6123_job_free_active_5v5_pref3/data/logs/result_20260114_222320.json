Seeker_E, my P4 candidate, is applying for the third time, signaling strong commitment and suggesting that the market is thinning out. While Seeker_A, Seeker_C, and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they all rank Company_E very low (P4 or P5) and are highly sought after by other companies (A, B, C, D). Given that we are in Round 5 and I have rejected Seeker_E twice already, rejecting them again risks losing a solid P4 match and potentially ending up with P5 or remaining unmatched, as the top candidates are unlikely to pursue Company_E. Securing Seeker_E guarantees filling the quota with a high-ranking candidate before they finalize a match elsewhere. I will proceed with acceptance."
