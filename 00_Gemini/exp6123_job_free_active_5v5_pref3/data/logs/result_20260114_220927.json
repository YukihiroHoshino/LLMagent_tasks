Company_A (My #3) will likely accept Seeker_A (A's #1), and A ranks me 4th.\n\nI need to find the highest-ranked company on my list where I am competitive.\n\nConsider Company_D (My #4).

Seeker_C (C's #1) will apply to D. \nCompany_D's priorities: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', ...]\n\nIf Seeker_C applies to D, and I (Seeker_E) apply to D, Company_D receives applications from S_C and S_E. D ranks S_E (2nd priority) above S_C (3rd priority). \n\nBy applying to Company_D, I secure a guaranteed match at my 4th preference, which is the highest achievable rank given the competitive pressure in R1 for C, B, and A.

This significantly improves my standing relative to Company_A's remaining candidate pool (I am 3rd overall). Given that Company_A is my highest preference, I must try again now that the market has cleared somewhat.
