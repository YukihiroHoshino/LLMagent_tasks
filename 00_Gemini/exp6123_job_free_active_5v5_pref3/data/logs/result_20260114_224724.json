Although I was rejected by Company_E previously, securing a match with Company_E is preferable to remaining unemployed, as it is on my preference list. Given that four rounds have passed and only Company_E remains unmatched (Capacity 1), it is highly likely that Company_E's higher-priority seekers (Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_B) have matched elsewhere. This makes me, Seeker_E (Rank 4 on their list), potentially their highest remaining option. I must re-apply assertively to secure the match in this round, emphasizing immediate commitment and suitability now that the market is closing."

I previously rejected Seeker_B (3rd preference) and Seeker_E twice (4th preference) to hold out for Seeker_A or Seeker_C (1st and 2nd priorities). Although Seeker_E is persistent, accepting my 4th choice now would contradict the previous strategic rejection of the 3rd choice (Seeker_B) and Signal a premature surrender of the chance to secure a higher-ranked candidate. Since it is only Round 5, I will maintain my high standards and continue to wait for Seeker_A, C, or B."

Given the history and Seeker_E's explicit recognition that the market has consolidated and they are the 'final available candidate,' it is highly probable that Ranks 1, 2, and 3 are matched elsewhere.
