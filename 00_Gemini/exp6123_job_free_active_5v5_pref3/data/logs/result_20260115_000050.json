Seeker_C is my second-highest priority candidate (Rank 2). While Seeker_A is Rank 1, Seeker_A lists Company_E last (Rank 5) and is highly unlikely to apply unless all other options fail. Since Seeker_C has applied directly in Round 3, this represents a strong, immediate opportunity to secure a high-priority candidate. Given the limited quota, accepting Seeker_C guarantees an excellent match now rather than risking the quota on the uncertain prospect of Seeker_A applying later."

However, Company_A's top two preferred seekers (Seeker_B and Seeker_D) must now be matched elsewhere, making me (Seeker_A, originally rank 3 for Company_A) the highest available candidate for them.\nSince this is the final round for a match and Company_A is my preferred outcome, I must apply aggressively, leveraging the fact that we are the last agents remaining, making this a mutually beneficial and stable match."

We are now in Round 4, and Seeker_A is applying for the third time, explicitly stating that they believe we are the last remaining pair in the market, implying Seeker_B and Seeker_D are likely matched elsewhere. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched if I reject my Rank 3 candidate again, and the strong, repeated commitment from Seeker_A, securing this stable match is the optimal strategy at this stage.
