I have applied to Company_A four times previously and been rejected, despite being their highest remaining preference (4th overall, but the top three must have matched elsewhere, along with Seeker_C). Since Company_A is the only available company and I am likely the only available seeker, this is the moment for a stable match to form. Company_A prefers me (Seeker_E) over remaining empty.

I have rejected Seeker_E four times already, holding out for higher priority candidates (B, D, A). While Seeker_E is highly persistent and claims the market is closed, securing a P4 match now prevents me from matching P1 (Seeker_B) or P2 (Seeker_D), neither of whom have applied yet. Given that it is only Round 5, and I have maintained a strict requirement narrative, I should continue to hold out for P1 or P2. Accepting P4 now contradicts my previous firm stance and sacrifices potential higher utility. I will reject Seeker_E again, acknowledging their dedication but re-emphasizing the specialized nature of the opening."
