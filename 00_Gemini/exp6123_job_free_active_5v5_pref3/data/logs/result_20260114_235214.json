I have consistently rejected Seeker_E in previous rounds, indicating I am holding out for my higher priority candidates (A, C, B). Since it is only Round 5, there is still ample time for my preferred candidates to become available or apply. Accepting Seeker_E now means settling for a low-ranked match. I will reject Seeker_E again to preserve my quota for a better fit."

I have applied three times previously and been rejected, suggesting Company_E was holding out for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_A, C, B) or perhaps waiting for Seeker_D. Since we are in Round 6 and Company_E is the only active company, it is highly probable that all higher-ranked candidates on Company_E's priority list have matched elsewhere. Therefore, Seeker_E (who ranks 4th for Company_E) should now be the top available candidate for them. I must [APPLY] aggressively, framing this as the necessary, final match to clear the market."

Seeker_E's current message suggests that the market has largely cleared, meaning A, C, and B are likely matched elsewhere. If I reject Seeker_E now, I risk failing to fill my quota or being forced to match with my lowest priority, Seeker_D. Since Seeker_E is the highest available candidate remaining on my list (4th priority), and my quota is 1, it is strategically sound to secure this match now to prevent a worse outcome.
