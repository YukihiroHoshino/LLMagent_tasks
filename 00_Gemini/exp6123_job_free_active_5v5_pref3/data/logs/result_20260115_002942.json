We have reviewed the current market landscape and your profile again, and we agree that your determination provides a strong foundation for a successful partnership. We are pleased to formally accept your application. Welcome to the team!",
              "thought": "I am Company_E, and my goal is to secure the highest priority match possible with a quota of 1. My priority list is: ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_D']. Seeker_E is my 4th priority. Given that this is Round 5 and Seeker_E is applying for the third time, they are highly motivated to join Company_E, despite E being their last preference. Higher priority candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_B) are likely highly contested or already matched with companies they prefer (e.g., Seeker_C likely with Company_C, Seeker_B contested by A/B). If I reject Seeker_E again, they are likely to turn permanently to Company_D, which ranks Seeker_E as their 2nd priority. Since securing a match (even 4th priority) is better than remaining unmatched or settling for the 5th priority (Seeker_D, who is likely matched with Company_D), I will accept Seeker_E now to fill my quota."
