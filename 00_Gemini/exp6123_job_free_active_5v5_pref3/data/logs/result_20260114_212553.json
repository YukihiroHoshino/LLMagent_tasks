My priority list is ['Seeker_D' (P1), 'Seeker_A' (P2), 'Seeker_B' (P3), 'Seeker_C' (P4), 'Seeker_E' (P5)].\nSeeker_B (P3) is applying for the second time, indicating extremely high interest (Company_B is Seeker_B's P1 choice).\nI previously rejected Seeker_B hoping for P1 (Seeker_D) or P2 (Seeker_A) to engage. Neither has contacted me this round.\nIf I reject Seeker_B again, I risk losing them entirely, as Seeker_B is Company_A's top priority (P1 for Company_A). Securing a P3 match, especially one that is highly motivated and stable (P1 preference), is a strong outcome.\nSince P1 and P2 targets are not engaging, and Seeker_B is applying aggressively, I will accept Seeker_B to secure a high-ranking match and fill my quota."

Company_E is my P5 (least preferred) option, but it is still on my list. Since remaining unemployed is the only alternative to matching with E, I must secure this match.\nCrucially, Company_E ranks me (Seeker_C) as their P2 candidate, meaning I have a very high chance of being accepted immediately.\nTherefore, the strategy is to formally [APPLY] to Company_E immediately to finalize the match before any other remaining seeker potentially gets accepted."
