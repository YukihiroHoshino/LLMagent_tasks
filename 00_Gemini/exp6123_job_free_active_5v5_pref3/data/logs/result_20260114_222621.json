While I ideally aim for Seeker_D (Rank 1) or Seeker_E (Rank 2), both of those seekers rank Company_D very low (Rank 5 and Rank 4, respectively), making them unlikely to apply early and highly susceptible to being matched elsewhere. Securing a Rank 3 candidate who views us as their top choice in Round 1 is a strong, stable outcome. Holding out for a marginal improvement (Rank 2) carries significant risk of losing Seeker_C to another company or ending up with a lower-ranked seeker later (Seeker_B is Rank 4).
