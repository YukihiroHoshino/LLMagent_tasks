              "thought": "I am Company_E. My priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_D']. Seeker_E is ranked 4th. I have 1 quota remaining. I have rejected Seeker_E twice previously, hoping for a higher ranked candidate (A, C, or B) to apply. However, none of the top 3 have applied, and given that all three rank Company_E extremely low (4th or 5th), it is highly unlikely they will approach me before securing a match elsewhere. Seeker_E is applying for the third time, suggesting limited remaining options and commitment. Since the risk of remaining unmatched is increasing, and Seeker_E is the highest available candidate applying, securing this match (Rank 4) is the most rational decision at this stage. I will accept Seeker_E."
