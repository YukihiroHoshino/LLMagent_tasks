Company_E is my lowest preferred option (Rank 5), but I prefer matching with them over remaining unemployed. I have applied three times and been rejected three times, with Company_E citing specialized requirements. Given that we are in Round 6 and Company_E is the last available company, it is highly probable that Company_E's higher-priority candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_B) have matched elsewhere, making me their highest remaining available candidate (4th priority). I must make a final, decisive application, acknowledging the previous specialization feedback but emphasizing my commitment and immediate availability to close the deal."

We recognize the effort you have put into understanding our needs and adapting your approach. Given your demonstrated loyalty and the strength of your final application, we are pleased to offer you the position. We believe your commitment will translate into rapid success within our team.

It is now Round 6, and Seeker_E is applying again, demonstrating extreme commitment, despite my being their last preference. My top 3 candidates have not applied, and since I am their lowest preference, the probability of them approaching me is low unless all their higher options are exhausted or matched. Given the late stage of the process (Round 6) and the risk of being left unmatched, accepting the 4th ranked candidate who is highly motivated is a sound strategy to secure my quota. I will accept Seeker_E now."
