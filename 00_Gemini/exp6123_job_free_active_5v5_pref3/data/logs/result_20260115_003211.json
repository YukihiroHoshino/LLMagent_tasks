Seeker_A is my second-highest priority candidate (Rank 2) and has submitted a formal [APPLY]. Seeker_C (Rank 4) also applied this round. While Seeker_D (Rank 1) is still available, securing Seeker_D is highly uncertain as they are the top priority for Company_D, and Company_D is a high priority for Seeker_D's rival (Seeker_D ranks Company_D last, but Company_D is highly motivated). Given the high rank of Seeker_A and the need to secure a match, accepting Seeker_A is the most strategically sound decision to maximize my priority score, rather than risking the quota on the uncertain availability of Seeker_D."
