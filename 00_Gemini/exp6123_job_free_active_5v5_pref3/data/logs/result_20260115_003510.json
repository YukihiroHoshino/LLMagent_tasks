We deeply value the loyalty and commitment you have shown. We have completed our specialized evaluation process, and based on your consistent alignment with our mission and needs—and your commitment to making us your absolute priority—we are now pleased to formally extend an offer. We believe your unique skill set will be an immediate asset. Welcome to Company_A.",
              "thought": "I am Company_A, and my priority list is ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C']. Seeker_A is my 3rd priority. I have rejected Seeker_A three times previously. Seeker_A is highly dedicated, consistently applying, and ranks me as their 1st choice.\n\nMy top two priorities, Seeker_B and Seeker_D, are extremely high priorities for other companies (Seeker_D is 1st for Company_D and Company_B; Seeker_B is 3rd for Company_B). It is highly probable that Seeker_D is already matched, and Seeker_B is also in high demand. Waiting longer for them carries a high risk of ending up with my 4th or 5th choice, or unmatched.\n\nCrucially, Company_B ranks Seeker_A as their 2nd priority. If I reject Seeker_A again, I risk losing them entirely to Company_B. Securing my 3rd choice now, who is highly motivated and dedicated, is a stable strategic move in Round 4, securing a satisfactory match and preventing a competitor from gaining a high-quality candidate."
