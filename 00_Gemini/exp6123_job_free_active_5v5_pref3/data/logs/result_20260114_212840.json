Company_A rejected me twice, suggesting they are holding out for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_B or Seeker_D). Company_C is already matched (implied by its absence from the unmatched list). Company_D is also matched.\nI must now move down my preference list to secure a match before the remaining positions are taken.\nMy remaining available options, in order of preference, are Company_B (Rank 4) and Company_E (Rank 5).\n\nCompany_B ranks me second overall (P2). Assuming the top candidate (Seeker_D) has matched elsewhere (likely Company_C, their P1, which is now matched), I am likely the highest remaining candidate for Company_B. \n\nGiven the high priority Company_B places on me, and my need to secure a match higher than my last resort (Company_E), I will formally apply to Company_B immediately to secure the position."
