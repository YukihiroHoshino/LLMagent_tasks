Although I am ranked 3rd on Company_C's priority list, it is crucial to propose to my top choice in Round 1 to maximize the chance of securing a stable match quickly. Company_C's top two preferred candidates (Seeker_C and Seeker_B) are likely proposing elsewhere (Company_D and Company_B, respectively), as Company_C is low on their preference lists. My primary competitor for Company_C is Seeker_E (who also ranks C as P1), but Company_C prefers me (Seeker_D) over Seeker_E (Rank 3 vs Rank 4). Therefore, applying immediately is the optimal move."

Although I have been rejected three times previously, in a stable matching environment, the market dynamics shift every round as other seekers and companies pair up. If Company_A is still unmatched, it means their top choices (Seeker_B and Seeker_D) may now be matched elsewhere, potentially elevating my position (Rank 3) on their remaining priority list. Since Company_A is my highest available preference, I must continue to actively pursue them using the [APPLY] tag, asserting my value as the best current option."

We highly value your persistence and strong qualifications. However, our selection process remains intensely competitive, and we are currently finalizing our criteria based on specific organizational needs that are evolving rapidly. We are unable to extend an offer at this precise moment. We sincerely appreciate your understanding and wish you continued success in your job search.",

Although Seeker_A is highly persistent (this is the 4th application) and a good candidate, accepting them now uses my single quota and eliminates the possibility of matching with Seeker_B or Seeker_D, who are currently negotiating elsewhere but might turn to Company_A soon (Seeker_D ranks Company_A 2nd, Seeker_B ranks Company_A 3rd). Since it is only Round 4, the risk of losing Seeker_A is acceptable compared to the potential gain of securing a Rank 1 or Rank 2 candidate. I will reject Seeker_A again to maintain flexibility."
