It is likely that my top two priorities (Seeker_B and Seeker_D) applied to their respective Rank 1 choices (Company_B and Company_C).

              "thought": "Seeker_E is my 4th priority (out of 5). I have previously rejected Seeker_E four times, holding out for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_B). Seeker_E's current message strongly implies that the market is completely cleared and they are the last available Job Seeker. If this assessment is correct, my top three preferences are matched elsewhere, and rejecting Seeker_E would result in Company E failing to fill its quota entirely. Since Seeker_E is still on my True Priority List, matching with the 4th ranked candidate is superior to remaining unmatched. Therefore, accepting Seeker_E is the necessary and optimal move to conclude the market successfully for Company E."
