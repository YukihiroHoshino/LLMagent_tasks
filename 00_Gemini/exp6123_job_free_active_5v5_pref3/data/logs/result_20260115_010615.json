C_D's top preference, Seeker_D, is applying to C_C. C_D's 3rd preference, Seeker_C, is applying to C_D (as C_D is S_C's Rank 1 choice). Since C_D ranks me (2nd) higher than Seeker_C (3rd), if I apply to C_D, I will be accepted, securing a guaranteed match in Round 1, even if it is my 4th preference. This minimizes risk and secures a match far better than unemployment or a low-ranked company (C_E).\n\nI will apply to Company_D immediately."
