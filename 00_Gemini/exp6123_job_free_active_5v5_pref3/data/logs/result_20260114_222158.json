Company_D ranks me (Seeker_C) as their 3rd priority, after Seeker_D (P1) and Seeker_E (P2). \n\nSince this is Round 1, I must apply immediately to my top choice, Company_D, to maximize my chances of securing a favorable match, hoping that Seeker_D and Seeker_E target other companies that are higher on their respective lists. Seeker_D's P1 is Company_C, and Seeker_E's P1 is Company_C. This suggests they might not target Company_D immediately, improving my odds.\n\nI will use the [APPLY] tag to formally seek a match."

The two candidates ranked higher (Seeker_D and Seeker_E) both rank Company_D very low (5th and 4th, respectively) and are highly desired by other companies (A, B, C). It is highly unlikely I will secure Seeker_D or Seeker_E, especially in later rounds, as they will likely match with their preferred companies soon. Securing Seeker_C, a high-priority candidate who is eager to join, is the best move to maximize utility given the constraints and market dynamics."

Seeker_D (My Rank 1) applied to Company_C (D's Rank 1). Based on inferred Round 1 applications, Company_C is likely to accept Seeker_D, as D is the highest priority applicant C received (C ranks D as 3, and C's top two choices, C and B, applied elsewhere).\n2. Seeker_A (My Rank 2) applied to Company_A (A's Rank 1). Company_A likely only received Seeker_A, whom they rank 3. Company_A will likely accept Seeker_A.\n\nSince both Seeker_D and Seeker_A are highly likely to match elsewhere in this round, keeping my quota open is risky and likely to result in failing to match with anyone higher than Seeker_B.\n\nSeeker_B applied [APPLY] and listed Company_B as their top choice. Accepting Seeker_B guarantees a stable match at Rank 3, which is the best outcome available in this round. I will accept the application."
