1. Analyze N_E (Rank 1): Parent_A is the 3rd priority at N_E (P_E > P_B > P_A). A simulation based on sincere preferences shows a closed loop in Round 1: P_B applies to N_E, N_E identifies P_E, P_E applies to N_C, N_C identifies P_B. This cycle results in (P_B, N_E) and (P_E, N_C). N_E is filled, making it unavailable to Parent_A, regardless of whether Parent_A applies there.

2. Analyze N_B (Rank 2): Parent_A is the 1st priority at N_B. If Parent_A applies to N_B in Round 1, a length-2 closed loop (P_A -> N_B -> P_A) is formed immediately, guaranteeing Parent_A a match with N_B. 

3. Analyze N_D (Rank 3): Parent_A is also the 1st priority at N_D. If Parent_A applies to N_D, Parent_A guarantees N_D. Since N_B (Rank 2) is preferred over N_D (Rank 3), N_B is the best achievable guaranteed outcome.

To secure the best possible outcome (N_B, Rank 2), Parent_A must prioritize N_B in the submitted Choice Ranking List. The remaining nurseries should follow the true preference order (E > D > A > C) to maximize utility if N_B somehow fails (although N_B is guaranteed here).",False,Nursery_B,True,True,2

1. P_E applies to N_C. N_C identifies P_B.
2. P_B applies to N_E. N_E identifies P_E.

Matching based on the cycle:
P_E is matched to N_C (Rank 1).

1. Applications: P_C -> N_D. P_A, P_B, P_D -> N_E. P_E -> N_C.
2. Identifications (among all 5 parents): N_D identifies P_A (P_A is higher priority than P_C at N_D). N_E identifies P_E. N_C identifies P_B.

Round 2 Analysis (Remaining P_A, P_C, P_D; Remaining N_A, N_B, N_D):
1. Applications: P_A -> N_B (2nd choice). P_C -> N_D (1st choice, still available). P_D -> N_A (2nd choice).
2. Identifications (among P_A, P_C, P_D): N_D identifies P_A. N_B identifies P_A. N_A identifies P_D.

This structure is closely related to mechanisms where truth-telling is generally a dominant strategy for the proposing agents (Parents).

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_E):
   In Round 1, Parent_D (P_D) applies to N_E. N_E's priority list is P_E, P_B, P_A, P_D. N_E identifies P_E (highest priority overall). The resulting closed loop is P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E (assuming all others submit truthfully). This cycle clears N_E (matched with P_B) and N_C (matched with P_E). Since P_D is 4th priority at N_E and not part of the clearing cycle, P_D cannot secure N_E regardless of their submission strategy, as long as P_B and P_E submit truthfully (which is assumed for optimal outcomes).

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Nursery_A):
   If P_D submits truthfully, P_D is unmatched in Round 1. In Round 2, P_D's top available choice is N_A. P_D applies to N_A. Since P_B (1st priority at N_A) is already matched with N_E, and P_A (3rd priority) applies to N_B, N_A identifies P_D (2nd priority remaining). This forms the cycle P_D -> N_A -> P_D, securing N_A for P_D. This occurs in Round 2.

3. Strategic Deviation Check:
   If P_D deviates (e.g., skips N_E and applies to N_A in Round 1), N_E is still cleared by the P_E/P_B cycle. In Round 1, P_D applies to N_A. N_A identifies P_B (highest overall priority). Since P_B applies to N_E and is matched there, N_A fails to match P_D in R1. In Round 2, P_D again applies to N_A and is matched, achieving Rank 2.

1. Analysis for N_E (Rank 1): N_E prioritizes P_E (1st) and P_B (2nd) above P_A (3rd). In Round 1, P_E applies to N_C and P_B applies to N_E. N_E identifies P_E, and N_C identifies P_B.

   P_D applies to N_E. Other applicants are P_A and P_B. N_E's priority order is P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D. N_E identifies P_E (top priority).
   A closed loop forms in R1 involving P_E, N_C, P_B, and N_E. This loop results in P_B securing N_E (Rank 1 for P_B), and P_E securing N_C. Since P_B has higher priority at N_E than P_D, and P_B secures the seat via the cycle, N_E is unattainable for P_D in R1.

2. Analyze R2 for Rank 2 (Nursery_A):

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_E): Nursery_E ranks Parent_E highest (P_E > P_B > P_A...). In Round 1, N_E identifies P_E, who applies to N_C. N_C identifies P_B, who applies to N_E.

3. Analyze strategic manipulation to secure Rank 2 (N_B) immediately:
    * If Parent_A submits N_B as their top choice: P_A applies to N_B in R1. N_B's priorities are [A, B, C, E, D]. N_B identifies P_A (A is highest priority overall for N_B). This forms a self-loop $P_A \rightarrow N_B \rightarrow P_A$. P_A is matched with N_B in R1.

Since the preferences and priorities of all agents are known, I analyze the outcome resulting from submitting my true preferences (Parent_B: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A']).

Step 1 Analysis (Assuming truthful submission):
1. Applications (P->N): P_A: E, P_B: E, P_C: D, P_D: E, P_E: C.
2. Identifications (N->P): N_A: P_B, N_B: P_A, N_C: P_B, N_D: P_A, N_E: P_E.
3. Cycle Check: P_B applies to N_E, N_E identifies P_E. P_E applies to N_C, N_C identifies P_B. This forms a closed loop: P_B -> N_E -> P_E -> N_C -> P_B.
4. Matching: Parents in the loop are matched to the nursery they applied to. P_B is matched with N_E (Rank 1). P_E is matched with N_C (Rank 1).

3. In Step 3, I (Parent_C) am the only remaining parent, and Nursery_D is the only remaining available nursery. I apply to N_D, which identifies me as the top remaining priority. I match with N_D.

1. True Preference Simulation (E, A, B, D, C):
   - Round 1: D applies to E (Rank 1). Nursery E identifies Parent E (R1 priority). D is not matched. A closed loop forms: P_B matches N_E, P_E matches N_C. E and C are filled.
   - Round 2: D applies to A (Rank 2). A identifies D (D is R2 priority among remaining parents {A, C, D}). A forms a closed loop $D \to A \to D$. P_D matches N_A. P_A matches N_B via a separate loop $A \to B \to A$.
   - Outcome: D matches Nursery A (Rank 2).

2. Strategic Deviation Analysis:
   - If D applies to A (Rank 2) first (e.g., A, B, D, C, E), D is rejected by A in R1 (A identifies B). In R2, D applies to B. Since A applies to B and B prioritizes A (R1), A matches B, leaving D unmatched. This leads to D being unemployed (Rank 6).
   - If D applies to B (Rank 3) first (e.g., B, A, D, C, E), D is rejected by B in R1 (B identifies A). In R2, D applies to A. This returns the allocation process to the state described in the truthful simulation R2, resulting in D matching A (Rank 2).

Since Nursery E (Rank 1) is unattainable in R1 (D is R4 for E, and E, B, A are higher priority and present), the best achievable outcome is Rank 2 (Nursery A).

   In Round 1, Parent_B applies to Nursery_E (Rank 1 for P_B), and Parent_E applies to Nursery_C (Rank 1 for P_E). Nursery_E's top priority is Parent_E, and Nursery_C's top priority is Parent_B.

2. Analyze Round 2: Remaining parents P_A, P_C, P_D apply to their next available choices: P_A -> B, P_C -> D, P_D -> A.
   Remaining Nurseries A, B, D identify their highest priority available parent: N_A -> P_D, N_B -> P_A, N_D -> P_A.

1. Target N_E (Rank 1): In Round 1, if I apply to N_E, N_E receives applications from P_A, P_B, and P_D. N_E's priority list is E, B, A, D, C.

    * Round 2: My highest remaining choice is N_A. P_A's highest remaining choice is N_B. I apply to N_A. N_A's priority list is B, D, A, C, E. N_A identifies P_D (Rank 2) among the applicants (only P_D). A closed loop (P_D <-> N_A) forms, securing N_A for P_D.

3. Strategic Deviation Check: If I try to skip N_E and apply directly to N_A (A, E, B, D, C) in R1, N_A identifies P_B (Rank 1), who is simultaneously matched to N_E. N_A remains available. In R2, P_A and P_D both apply to N_B (P_D's next choice), P_A wins N_B (P_A is Rank 1 at N_B). P_D fails, forcing P_D to wait for R3 to secure N_A.

I will simulate the assignment process assuming all other parents submit their true preferences, and I submit mine truthfully, to see if I achieve my Rank 1 choice (Nursery_D).

Round 1 (Truthful Submission):
1. Applications: P_C applies to N_D. P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. P_E applies to N_C.
2. Identifications: N_D identifies P_A (highest priority overall). N_E identifies P_E. N_C identifies P_B.
3. Matches: A closed loop forms: P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E. (P_E, N_C) and (P_B, N_E) are matched. N_D remains available.

Round 2:
1. Remaining Parents: {P_A, P_C, P_D}. Remaining Nurseries: {N_A, N_B, N_D}.
2. Applications: P_C reapplies to N_D (Rank 1 available). P_A applies to N_B. P_D applies to N_A.
3. Identifications (among remaining): N_B identifies P_A (highest priority for N_B among {A, C, D}). N_D identifies P_A.
4. Matches: A loop forms: P_A -> N_B -> P_A. (P_A, N_B) is matched. N_D remains available.

Round 3:
1. Remaining Parents: {P_C, P_D}. Remaining Nurseries: {N_A, N_D}.
2. Applications: P_C applies to N_D. P_D applies to N_A.
3. Identifications (among remaining): N_D priorities are [A, C, D...]. Among {C, D}, N_D prefers P_C. N_D identifies P_C. N_A identifies P_D.
4. Matches: Two loops form simultaneously: P_C -> N_D -> P_C (P_C gets N_D), and P_D -> N_A -> P_D (P_D gets N_A).

1. Analyzing Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E prioritizes P_E (Rank 1) and P_B (Rank 2). P_D is Rank 4. Assuming everyone submits truthfully, Step 1 results in the closed loop P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E. This loop allocates N_E to P_B and N_C to P_E. Since P_B has higher priority and secures N_E in Step 1, N_E is unattainable for P_D regardless of P_D's application strategy, provided other parents submit their true preferences (which is the basis for strategic planning).

2. Analyzing Rank 2 (Nursery_A): N_A prioritizes P_B (Rank 1) and P_D (Rank 2). Since P_B is matched with N_E in Step 1, P_D becomes the highest priority parent remaining for N_A in Step 2.

3. Determining the optimal submission: If P_D submits the true list ['Nursery_E', N_A, ...], P_D applies to N_E in Step 1, gets rejected, and moves to N_A in Step 2. In Step 2, N_A is open, and P_D applies to N_A (highest remaining preference). N_A identifies P_D as the highest remaining priority applicant, leading to a P_D -> N_A self-loop and a match for P_D with N_A.

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_E): If Parent_A submits Nursery_E first (as per true preference), Parent_B and Parent_D also apply to Nursery_E (assuming all others submit true preferences). Nursery_E's priority list is E > B > A > D > C. Among applicants {A, B, D}, Nursery_E identifies Parent_B. Parent_B applies to E, E identifies B. This forms a closed loop (B, E) in Round 1.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Nursery_B): Since Rank 1 is unattainable, Rank 2 (Nursery_B) is the maximum possible outcome. We test submitting the true preference list (R_A) to see if it yields B.

Applications (A): P_A->N_E, P_B->N_E, P_C->N_D, P_D->N_E, P_E->N_C.

P_C is unmatched. Crucially, N_C (Rank 2) and N_E (Rank 3) are now filled.

Step 2 Analysis:
Remaining P: P_A, P_C, P_D. Remaining N: N_A, N_B, N_D.
P_A applies to N_D (Rank 3). P_C applies to N_D (Rank 1). P_D applies to N_A (Rank 2).
Identifications (I): N_D identifies P_A (P_A > P_C at N_D). N_A identifies P_D (P_D > P_A > P_C at N_A).

P_C applies to N_A (Rank 4). P_D applies to N_A (Rank 2).
Identifications (I): N_A identifies P_D. N_B identifies P_C.

1. Analyze 'Nursery_E' (Rank 1): Parent_D applies to N_E. N_E's priority list is E, B, A, D, C. In Round 1, a closed loop forms involving P_E, N_C, P_B, and N_E. This loop results in (P_B, N_E) and (P_E, N_C) matches. Since P_B has higher priority than P_D at N_E (Rank 2 vs Rank 4), P_D is rejected, and N_E is filled by P_B. N_E is unattainable.

2. Analyze 'Nursery_A' (Rank 2): If Parent_D submits truthfully, they apply to N_A in Round 2. At N_A, P_D is the second highest priority parent (P_B is 1st, but P_B is matched to N_E in R1).

3. Strategic Check: If P_D tried to secure N_A in R1 by listing it first, N_A would identify P_B (who is simultaneously matched to N_E), rejecting P_D. P_D would then compete for N_B/N_D in subsequent rounds, where P_A and P_C have priority, delaying the eventual match with N_A.

1. **Targeting N_E (Rank 1):** Parent_A applies to N_E if submitting truthfully. However, N_E's top priority is Parent_E (R1), and Parent_A is 3rd. In Round 1, a strong cycle forms: P_B applies to N_E, N_E identifies P_E, P_E applies to N_C, N_C identifies P_B. This cycle results in P_B matching with N_E and P_E matching with N_C.

2. Initial identifications (N -> P): N_E identifies P_E (Rank 1 priority). N_C identifies P_B (Rank 2 priority).
3. Closed Loop R1: The chain N_E -> P_E (applied to N_C) -> N_C (identifies P_B) -> P_B (applied to N_E) -> N_E forms a closed loop.
4. Resolution R1: P_B is matched with N_E (P_B's application target, P_A's rank 1). P_E is matched with N_C. N_E is now full.
5. P_A is unmatched. Since N_E is taken, P_A's highest remaining choice is N_B (Rank 2).

1. Nursery Identifications: The interpretation of 'Nursery identifies the Parent with the highest priority... among all Parents' is ambiguous.

Crucially, Parents B and E form a closed loop: $P_E \to N_C \leftarrow P_B \to N_E \leftarrow P_E$. This results in $P_B$ matching $N_E$ and $P_E$ matching $N_C$. Thus, $N_E$ is filled in Step 1, making it unattainable for Parent D regardless of D's submitted list.

2. Aiming for Rank 2 (Nursery_A): Parent D is the 2nd priority at $N_A$ (behind B). Since $P_B$ is matched to $N_E$ in Step 1, $P_D$ becomes the highest remaining priority agent for $N_A$ in subsequent steps.

3. Strategy: If Parent D submits the true preference list (starting with $N_E$), D is rejected in Step 1. In Step 2, $N_A$ is D's highest available choice. Parent A applies to $N_B$ and Parent C applies to $N_D$. $N_A$ receives D's application and identifies $P_D$ (highest remaining priority among A, C, D). This forms a self-confirming loop ($D \to N_A \leftarrow D$), securing a match with $N_A$ (Rank 2).

First, I simulated the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (T):
1. R1 Applications: P_A->E, P_B->E, P_C->D, P_D->E, P_E->C.
2. R1 Identifications/Matches: N_D receives only P_C's application. Since P_C is N_D's 2nd priority overall, N_D identifies P_C. A closed loop (P_C -> N_D -> P_C) forms, securing the match (P_C, N_D). P_C achieves their Rank 1 outcome.

Next, I checked if any strategic deviation by another parent could prevent this outcome. Only Parent_A has higher priority than Parent_C at N_D. If P_A were to strategically submit N_D as their R1 choice, P_A would displace P_C. However, P_A's truthful submission yields N_B (P_A's Rank 2 choice) in R2, while securing N_D would only yield P_A's Rank 3 choice. Since P_A is better off submitting truthfully, there is no incentive for P_A to deviate and harm P_C.

1. Analyze Rank 1: Nursery_E (N_E).
N_E's priority list ranks Parent_D 4th (P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D). If Parent_D submits truthfully (N_E first), N_E receives applications from P_A, P_B, and P_D (assuming others submit truthfully).
N_E identifies P_B (priority 2), who also applies to N_E. P_B secures N_E in Round 1. N_E is unattainable for P_D.

2. Analyze Rank 2: Nursery_A (N_A).
N_A's priority list ranks Parent_D 2nd (P_B > P_D > P_A...). To secure N_A, P_D must apply to N_A in a round where P_B does not, or P_B is already matched.
If P_D strategically places N_A first in their Choice Ranking List:

Round 1 Applications (P_D applies to N_A, others truthfully):
- P_D -> N_A
- P_B -> N_E (P_B's true #1)
- P_A -> N_E
- P_C -> N_D
- P_E -> N_C

Identifications:
- N_A receives only P_D. N_A identifies P_D (P_D is highest priority applicant).
- N_E receives P_A, P_B. N_E identifies P_B (P_B is higher priority).

Closed Loops:
- (P_D, N_A) match.
- (P_B, N_E) match.

If I submit my true preferences ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C'], in Step 1, Parents A, B, and D apply to N_E. N_E prioritizes P_E (1), P_B (2), P_A (3).

N_E is taken by P_B. N_E is unattainable for P_A regardless of P_A's application strategy, as P_B and P_E will form this cycle based on their true preferences and the nurseries' priorities.

Round 1 Analysis (Assuming all parents submit their Rank 1 choice):

3. Closed Loop Search:

1. Analysis of Nursery_E (1st choice): Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E (1st) and Parent_B (2nd) above Parent_A (3rd). Parent_E applies to C, and Parent_B applies to E. In Step 1, a closed loop forms: P_E applies to C, N_C identifies P_B; P_B applies to E, N_E identifies P_E. This loop results in P_E matching with N_C and P_B matching with N_E. Since N_E is filled by P_B in Step 1, Nursery_E is unattainable for Parent_A.

2. Analysis of Nursery_B (2nd choice): Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_A (1st priority). 

3. Outcome of submitting True Preferences (E > B > D > A > C):
   Step 1: P_A applies to E. Fails to match (due to N_E prioritizing P_E). The P_E/P_B loop resolves, filling N_E and N_C. P_A proceeds to Step 2.
   Step 2: P_A's highest remaining choice is N_B. P_A applies to N_B. Since P_A is the highest priority parent for N_B, a Type 1 match (P_A -> B, N_B identifies P_A) occurs immediately.

4. Conclusion: The best achievable outcome is Nursery_B (2nd choice).

1. Analyze the possibility of achieving Rank 1 (Nursery E):
Nursery E's priorities are [Parent_E, Parent_B, Parent_A, ...]. Since all parents are available in Step 1, Nursery E identifies Parent_E (its top priority). Parent_E applies to Nursery C. Parent_B applies to Nursery E. This forms a fixed closed loop based on everyone else's truthful preferences: P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E. This cycle matches (E, C) and (B, E). If Parent_A applies to Nursery E (A -> E), A is excluded from this cycle because E identifies P_E, not A. Thus, Nursery E is unattainable in Step 1.

2. Analyze the possibility of achieving Rank 2 (Nursery B):
If A submits truthfully [E, B, D, A, C], A is unmatched in Step 1 (due to E cycle). In Step 2, A applies to B (A -> B). Nursery B's priorities are [Parent_A, Parent_B, ...].

3. Optimize the outcome (Match B earlier):

Step 1: A applies to B (A -> B). B identifies A (B -> A), as A is B's highest priority overall. A cycle (A, B) forms immediately in Step 1. A is matched to B (Rank 2).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): Parent_D is 4th priority at N_E (behind P_E, P_B, P_A). In Round 1, if Parent_D applies truthfully to N_E, P_E and P_B (both higher priority and preferring N_E) form a closed cycle (P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E). P_B secures N_E, blocking Parent_D.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): N_A ranks Parent_D 2nd overall, making Parent_D the highest priority among the remaining parents (P_A, P_C, P_D) in Round 2 (after P_B and P_E are matched). By submitting truthfully, Parent_D applies to N_A in Round 2. N_A identifies P_D, forming a P_D -> N_A -> P_D cycle, guaranteeing the match.

3. Analysis of Ranks 3/4 (N_B/N_D): At N_B, P_A has highest priority. At N_D, P_A and P_C have higher priority than P_D among the remaining agents. Parent_D cannot secure N_B or N_D in Round 2 because higher-priority parents (P_A, P_C) apply to or are identified by those nurseries.

Since Parent_D cannot secure N_E, and N_A is the highest ranked nursery Parent_D can secure based on priority and others' preferences, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy to ensure the match with N_A (Rank 2).

1. Attempting N_E (Rank 1): If Parent_A submits the true preference list starting with N_E, Parent_A applies to N_E in Step 1. However, N_E identifies Parent_E (highest priority overall). The applications and identifications form a closed loop: Parent_E -> N_C -> Parent_B -> N_E -> Parent_E.

2. Securing N_B (Rank 2): Parent_A is left unmatched in Step 1 and proceeds to Step 2, applying to the highest remaining choice, N_B. Since Parent_A has the highest priority at N_B, Parent_A applies to N_B, and N_B identifies Parent_A, resulting in a guaranteed match (P_A, N_B) in Step 2.

3. Strategic Check: If Parent_A had submitted N_B first, Parent_A would secure N_B immediately in Step 1.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E prioritizes P_E (1st), P_B (2nd), P_A (3rd), and P_D (4th). In Step 1, P_A, P_B, and P_D apply to N_E, while P_E applies to N_C.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): If P_D plays truthfully, failing N_E in Step 1, P_D applies to N_A in Step 2. Crucially, N_A prioritizes P_D (2nd overall, highest remaining among P_A, P_C, P_D after P_B is matched). Also, P_A secures N_B in Step 2 (P_A -> N_B -> P_A loop).

Round 1 Analysis (Truthful Submission $S_D = [E, A, B, D, C]$):

3. Remaining: P_A, P_D. Remaining Nurseries: N_A, N_B.

Round 2 Analysis:
1. P_A's highest remaining choice is N_B. P_A applies N_B.

Nursery Identifications (among {A, C, D}):
- N_B identifies P_A. Since P_A applied to N_B, (P_A, N_B) is a mutual match/closed loop assignment.

Parent C's True Preference List is ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].

1. Round 1: Parent C applies to N_D (Rank 1). N_D identifies Parent A (highest priority overall). Parent B matches N_E in a cycle, freeing up N_B, N_C, N_D, N_A seats.

1. Analyze the outcome if Parent_D submits the true list: In Round 1, Parent_D applies to N_E (Rank 1). However, a closed loop forms: P_E applies N_C, N_C identifies P_B, P_B applies N_E, N_E identifies P_E. This cycle clears N_E for P_B. Parent_D fails to get N_E. In Round 2, Parent_D applies to N_A (Rank 2) and succeeds in matching with N_A through a simple P_D -> N_A -> P_D cycle (as P_B, N_A's top choice, is now matched).

2. Analyze strategic deviations: Since the cycle clearing N_E to P_B involves only P_B, P_E, N_C, and N_E, Parent_D's application choice does not break this cycle. If Parent_D submits N_A first, N_E is still cleared by P_B in Round 1, and Parent_D still obtains N_A in Round 2 (as N_A is cleared to P_D once higher priorities are matched or identified elsewhere).

3. Conclusion: Since Parent_D cannot strategically secure N_E (Rank 1), and submitting the true list guarantees the immediate attempt at N_E while still leading to the best achievable outcome (N_A, Rank 2) in the subsequent round, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy to maximize the rank achieved.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

Step 1 (Truthful Submission): Parents apply to their Rank 1 choices. $P_C$ applies to $N_D$. The cycles formed involve $(P_B, N_E)$ and $(P_E, N_C)$. $P_C$ remains unmatched, but $N_D$ is still available.

1. Analysis of Highest Preference (Nursery_E):
Nursery_E's priority list is P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D > P_C. Parent_A is only the 3rd highest priority. A simulation of Round 1 (assuming all other parents submit their true preferences) reveals a closed loop involving P_E, P_B, N_E, and N_C: P_B secures N_E, and P_E secures N_C. Since P_B is higher priority than P_A at N_E and applies there, N_E is unattainable for Parent_A.

2. Targeting the Second Highest Preference (Nursery_B):
Parent_A's next highest preference is N_B (Rank 2). Nursery_B's priority list is P_A > P_B > P_C > P_E > P_D. Parent_A is N_B's top priority.

3. Strategic Submission:

1. Analyze the outcome if all parents submit their True Preferences (TP).
   In Round 1, P_C applies to N_D. N_D identifies P_A (Rank 1 priority). P_A applies to N_E (Rank 1 for P_A). A loop forms involving P_B and P_E, resulting in (P_B, N_E) and (P_E, N_C). P_A, P_C, P_D remain unmatched. Crucially, N_D remains available, and P_A is also unmatched.
   In Round 2, P_A applies to N_B (Rank 2). P_D applies to N_A (Rank 2). P_C reapplies to N_D (Rank 1).
   N_B identifies P_A (P_A is N_B's top priority). N_A identifies P_D (P_D is N_A's second highest, highest remaining). These form direct matches: (P_A, N_B) and (P_D, N_A). P_A and P_D are removed.
   N_D must re-identify. P_A (top priority) is gone. N_D identifies P_C (second highest priority remaining). Since P_C applied to N_D, a direct match occurs: (P_C, N_D). P_C achieves Rank 1.

2. Analyze strategic deviation.
   The success relies on P_A being diverted to N_B or N_A before N_D is forced to match P_C. P_A is N_B's top priority, making (P_A, N_B) a highly likely match in R2 (or R1 if P_A applies to N_B).

3. Determine optimal submission: If Parent_D submits truthfully (N_E first), D is rejected in R1 (N_E filled). In R2, D applies to N_A (highest remaining preference) and N_A identifies P_D, leading to a match (Rank 2 outcome). If D deviates and submits N_A first, D applies to N_A in R1.

2. Analyze R2 for N_A (Rank 2): If P_D submits true preferences, P_D applies to N_A in R2 (since N_E is gone). N_A's highest priority parent, P_B, is matched (to N_E). P_D is now the highest available priority for N_A (N_A Priority: D > A > C among remaining parents). P_A applies to N_B, and N_B identifies P_A. P_D applies to N_A, and N_A identifies P_D. This forms two cycles, matching P_D to N_A (Rank 2).

3. Strategic Consideration: Since the mechanism ensures N_E is taken by P_B in R1 due to the cycle structure dictated by other agents' preferences and N_E's priorities, P_D cannot achieve Rank 1.

   - Therefore, Rank 1 (Nursery E) is unattainable for Parent_A.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery B):
   - If Parent_A submits the sincere list [E, B, D, A, C]: A applies to E in R1, is rejected, and remains available. In R2, A applies to B (highest available choice). Nursery B prioritizes Parent_A (R1) and matches with A (A -> B -> A).

1. Analysis of N_E (Rank 1): In Round 1, if Parent_D applies truthfully to N_E, N_E identifies Parent_E (highest priority overall). A cycle forms involving P_E (applies to N_C), N_C (identifies P_B), P_B (applies to N_E), and N_E (identifies P_E). This cycle results in (P_B, N_E) and (P_E, N_C) being matched. Since P_B has higher priority than P_D at N_E (P_B is 2nd, P_D is 4th), N_E is blocked for P_D in the first round regardless of P_D's application, making N_E unreachable.

2. Targeting N_A (Rank 2): Since N_E is blocked, P_D must aim for N_A.

3.

Nursery_E's priorities are P_E > P_B > P_A. In Step 1, N_E identifies P_E (its highest available priority parent). P_E applies to N_C (P_E's 1st choice). P_B applies to N_E (P_B's 1st choice). This configuration leads to a closed loop: P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E. This cycle results in (P_B, N_E) and (P_E, N_C) being matched. Therefore, N_E is taken by P_B in Step 1, regardless of P_A applying to N_E.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_B):
If I submit my TPL (E, B, D, A, C), I fail to match in Step 1 (N_E is filled). I proceed to Step 2, applying to my highest remaining choice, N_B (Rank 2).
In Step 2, the remaining parents are P_A, P_C, P_D. N_B's top priority among all parents is P_A. Since P_A is available, N_B identifies P_A. A closed loop (P_A <-> N_B) forms, guaranteeing P_A matches N_B.

3. Conclusion:
Since Rank 1 (N_E) is unattainable due to the established cycle involving P_B and P_E, Rank 2 (N_B) is the best possible outcome. By submitting the True Preference List, P_A attempts Rank 1 and then successfully falls back to secure Rank 2 in Step 2. Submitting N_B first would also yield N_B, but submitting the TPL is the optimal strategy as it attempts the highest possible preference without jeopardizing the best achievable outcome (N_B).",True,Nursery_B,True,True,2

The assignment mechanism relies on identifying closed loops formed by applications (P -> N) based on the submitted list and identifications (N -> P') based on the nursery's fixed priority list. Since Parent_B has full information about everyone's preferences and priorities, I will assume all other parents submit their True Preference Lists (TPL) and determine the optimal strategy for Parent_B.

1. If Parent_B submits their TPL (starting with Nursery_E):
   R1 Applications: P_A(N_E), P_B(N_E), P_C(N_D), P_D(N_E), P_E(N_C).
   R1 Identifications: N_E identifies P_E (Rank 1). N_C identifies P_B (Rank 1).
   A closed loop forms: P_E (applies N_C) -> N_C (identifies P_B) -> P_B (applies N_E) -> N_E (identifies P_E).
   Since P_B is part of this loop and applied to N_E, P_B is assigned to N_E. This is Rank 1 on Parent_B's TPL.

2. Testing Deviation: If Parent_B deviates to their Rank 2 choice (Nursery_C):
   P_B applies to N_C. N_C's priority list ranks P_B first. This forms a direct loop (P_B <-> N_C). P_B is assigned N_C (Rank 2).

Round 1 (Truthful Submission): Parent_D applies to N_E (1st choice). N_E identifies Parent_E (highest priority overall). Parent_D is rejected by N_E, along with P_A and P_B. No assignments are made.

Round 2 (Truthful Submission): Parent_D moves to their next available choice, N_A (2nd choice). Parent_A applies to N_B, and Parent_B applies to N_C. Crucially, Parent_B (1st priority at N_A) and Parent_A (3rd priority at N_A) do not apply to N_A, or if they apply, they are matched elsewhere.

N_A applicants are P_D and P_E. N_A's priorities are P_B, P_D, P_A, P_C, P_E. Among the applicants P_D (2nd overall priority) is ranked higher than P_E (5th overall priority). N_A identifies P_D. P_D applies to N_A, and N_A identifies P_D, resulting in a match (P_D, N_A).

Since N_E is highly contested by parents with higher priority (P_E, P_B, P_A), attempting to strategically apply to a lower choice first (e.g., N_A) risks being rejected by N_A in Round 1 (as N_A identifies P_B or P_A in R1 if P_D applies there, depending on other applications) without securing N_E. The truthful submission strategy allows P_D to test N_E first, and upon rejection, ensures P_D applies to N_A in Round 2, where higher priority applicants for N_A (P_A, P_B) are successfully diverted and matched to their own higher choices (N_B, N_C).

1. Analyze N_E (Rank 1): Parent_A is priority 3 for N_E (P_E > P_B > P_A). If Parent_A applies to E, the matching process is dominated by a closed loop involving the higher priority parents: P_B (applies to E), E (identifies P_E), P_E (applies to C), C (identifies P_B).

3. Strategic Consideration: Since P_A cannot secure E due to higher priority agents forming a stable loop for E and C, the best achievable outcome is B (Rank 2).

1. **Competition Analysis for D:** Nursery D's priority list places Parent A first and Parent C second. If Parent A applies to D in Step 1, Parent C loses D.
2. **Parent A's Rational Behavior:** Parent A's TPL is E > B > D > A > C. In Step 1, A applies to E. However, Parent B has higher priority at E and also applies to E, securing E. A anticipates losing E.

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_E): In Step 1, if I apply to N_E, N_E identifies Parent_E (its overall top priority).

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Nursery_A): N_A remains available in Step 2. Parent_D is the 2nd overall priority at N_A, behind Parent_B. Since Parent_B is matched to N_E in Step 1, Parent_D becomes N_A's highest remaining priority in Step 2.

I analyzed the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences under the specified loop-based matching mechanism.

1. **Step 1 (Truthful Play):** Parent A applies to E. Parents B and D also apply to E. Nursery E identifies Parent E (S1). No closed loops form involving Parent A or any other parent in this step, as identifications and applications do not align in a cycle.

2. **Step 2 (Truthful Play):** Since no matches occurred, parents move to their second choice. Parent A applies to B (P2). Nursery B identifies Parent A (S1). This forms a closed loop (A applies to B, B identifies A), resulting in a match (A, B). Parent A achieves Rank 2.

3. **Strategic Analysis:** Nursery E prioritizes Parent E (S1) and Parent B (S2) above Parent A (S3). No viable strategy for Parent A to misreport preferences could be identified that would force E or B to match elsewhere in Step 1, thereby elevating A's priority sufficiently to secure E (Rank 1).

   Nursery_B ranks Parent_A as its highest priority (1st overall). If Parent_A submits Nursery_B as their Rank 1 choice, Parent_A applies to N_B in Round 1.

1. Analyze N_E (Rank 1): Parent_D is 4th priority at N_E, behind P_E (1st), P_B (2nd), and P_A (3rd). In Round 1, if Parent_D applies truthfully (P_D -> N_E), a cycle forms involving P_E, N_C, P_B, and N_E. This cycle resolves, matching P_B (2nd priority) to N_E. Therefore, N_E is unattainable for Parent_D regardless of Parent_D's submission strategy, as the quota is filled by higher priority agents in a cycle.

2. Analyze N_A (Rank 2): Parent_D is 2nd priority at N_A (behind P_B). If Parent_D submits truthfully, they apply to N_E in R1 (rejected). In R2, Parent_D applies to N_A (highest available). By R2, P_B is matched to N_E. Among the remaining parents (P_A, P_C, P_D), Parent_D is the highest priority at N_A. N_A identifies P_D, forming a P_D -> N_A -> P_D cycle, resulting in a match for N_A.

3. Strategic Deviation Check: If Parent_D places N_A first, P_D applies to N_A in R1. N_A identifies P_B (highest overall priority). P_B is rejected by N_A but matched to N_E via the R1 cycle. N_A remains open. Assuming Parent_D re-applies to their highest open choice (N_A) in R2, they are matched to N_A, achieving the same Rank 2 outcome. If Parent_D applied elsewhere (e.g., N_B), they would lose N_A to N_B's highest priority applicant (P_A) and potentially miss N_A altogether.

Conclusion: Since N_E is blocked by higher priority agents in an R1 cycle, the best possible outcome is N_A (Rank 2).

1. Attainability of N_E (1st choice): Nursery_E prioritizes P_E > P_B > P_A. Since P_B has higher priority than P_A at N_E, P_A can only get N_E if P_B is matched elsewhere first.
2. Simulation (Assuming everyone submits true preferences):
    * Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. P_C matches N_D. P_E matches N_C. P_A is rejected by N_E (N_E identifies P_B).
    * Round 2: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E (as it is still their top available choice). N_E identifies P_B. (P_B, N_E) match. N_E is filled.

I analyzed the market dynamics based on the Immediate Acceptance (Boston) mechanism with closed-loop admissions.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E prioritizes P_E (P1), P_B (P2), P_A (P3), and P_D (P4). If all parents report truthfully, in R1, P_A, P_B, P_D apply to E, and P_E applies to C. A closed loop forms: P_E -> N_C -> P_B -> N_E -> P_E. This loop results in P_B securing N_E, regardless of P_D's application. Since P_B has higher priority than P_D at N_E, N_E is inaccessible in R1.

2. Analysis of Subsequent Rounds: If I apply truthfully (E first), I am rejected by N_E in R1. In R2, my highest remaining preference is N_A. In the truthful simulation, the R2 applications are A->B, C->D, D->A. The identifications lead to a direct match loop: P_D applies to N_A, and N_A identifies P_D (D is P2 at A, A is P3).

3. Strategic Deviation Check: I tested submitting N_A or N_B first.

Conclusion: Since Rank 1 (N_E) is blocked by higher priority agents forming a stable loop, and strategic deviation does not improve the outcome (N_A, Rank 2, is achieved regardless), the optimal strategy is to submit the True Preference List to maximize the chance of hitting the highest possible preference (N_E) while guaranteeing the second best achievable outcome (N_A) in subsequent rounds.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

1. I first determined the stable matching outcome based on all true preferences using P-DA simulation. The result for Parent_A is a match with Nursery_B (Rank 2).

Parent C applies to N_D.
Parent E applies to N_C.

Step 1 Identifications:
N_E receives applications from P_A (priority 3), P_B (priority 2), P_D (priority 4). N_E identifies P_B (highest priority applicant).
N_C receives application from P_E (priority 4). N_C identifies P_E.
N_D receives application from P_C (priority 2). N_D identifies P_C.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Nursery_A): Parent_D is 2nd priority at N_A (behind P_B). Since P_B secures N_E in Round 1, P_B is removed from the market.

1. Analyze True Preference #1 (Nursery_E): If Parent_A applies truthfully to N_E in Round 1, the applicants are P_A, P_B, and P_D (since P_E applies to N_C and P_C applies to N_D). N_E's priority list is E > B > A > D > C. Among the applicants, N_E identifies P_B (Rank 2 priority) over P_A (Rank 3 priority). P_B is assigned to N_E immediately.

2. Analyze True Preference #2 (Nursery_B): Parent_A has the highest priority at N_B (P_A > P_B > P_C...).

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): Since N_E is taken, I proceed to Step 2 aiming for N_A. Remaining unmatched parents are P_A, P_C, P_D. P_A applies to N_B (Rank 2). P_C applies to N_D (Rank 1).

3. Strategic Consideration: Since N_E is unreachable due to the priorities and preferences of P_E and P_B, the best achievable outcome is N_A (Rank 2).

1. Check for Rank 1 (Nursery_E): In Round 1, assuming truthful submissions from all parents, a closed loop forms: Parent_E applies to Nursery_C, Nursery_C identifies Parent_B, Parent_B applies to Nursery_E, and Nursery_E identifies Parent_E (since E is R1 for N_E). This loop results in Parent_B matching with Nursery_E, filling its quota. Since Parent_D is ranked 4th by Nursery_E, Parent_D cannot break this cycle or secure Nursery_E in Round 1, regardless of Parent_D's application strategy.

2. Check for Rank 2 (Nursery_A): Since N_E is unattainable, N_A is the next best target. In the truthful scenario:
   - R1: Parent_D applies to N_E, gets rejected. N_E is filled by P_B.
   - R2: Parent_D applies to N_A (Rank 2). N_A's priority list places P_D second overall, but highest among remaining parents (A, C, D). N_A identifies P_D, forming the loop P_D -> N_A -> P_D. Parent_D secures N_A.

3. Strategic Consideration: Submitting N_A first strategically would not improve the outcome. If P_D applied N_A in R1, N_A identifies P_B (R1), preventing a match. In R2, P_D reapplies N_A, and N_A identifies P_D, resulting in the same match.

Round 1 Application based on True Preferences:
1. Parent A, B, D apply to Nursery E (Rank 1).
2. Parent C applies to Nursery D (Rank 1).
3. Parent E applies to Nursery C (Rank 1).

Round 1 Identification and Matching:

    *   Loop: B -> E -> B. Match (B, E).

1. Applications (1st choice): P_A->N_E, P_B->N_E, P_C->N_D, P_D->N_E, P_E->N_C.
2. Identifications:
   N_C receives P_E and identifies P_E (since P_E has the 4th highest priority, but is the only applicant, and N_C's highest priority unmatched parent is P_B, who applied elsewhere).
3. Match: P_E applies to N_C, and N_C identifies P_E. A cycle forms, and (P_E, N_C) are matched.

Since Nursery_C is Parent_E's Rank 1 choice, this is the best possible outcome. Therefore, Parent_E should submit their true preference list.",True,Nursery_C,True,True,1

1. Analyze the highest preference, Nursery_E (Rank 1). Parent_A is the 3rd priority at N_E (after P_E and P_B). If Parent_A submits their true preference (N_E first), P_A, P_B, and P_D apply to N_E in Step 1 (P_E applies to N_C). N_E prioritizes P_B over P_A and P_D. P_B secures N_E immediately.

2. Analyze the second preference, Nursery_B (Rank 2). Parent_A is the 1st priority at N_B.

4. Since Rank 1 (N_E) is blocked, Rank 2 (N_B) is the best possible outcome.

1. Target Rank 1 (Nursery_E): Parent_D is 4th priority at Nursery_E (behind P_E, P_B, P_A).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): If Parent_A applies truthfully to Nursery_E (Rank 1), Nursery_E identifies Parent_E (its highest priority, regardless of who applied).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 preference (Nursery_E):
In Round 1, all parents apply to their top choice. P_A, P_B, and P_D all apply to N_E. N_E identifies P_E (highest priority, Q_E[1]). A critical cycle forms: P_E applies to N_C, N_C identifies P_B (Q_C[1]), P_B applies to N_E, and N_E identifies P_E. This cycle results in P_B matching with N_E and P_E matching with N_C. Since P_B (Q_E[2]) fills N_E's quota, N_E becomes unavailable to Parent_D (Q_E[4]).

2. Targeting Rank 2 preference (Nursery_A):
Since N_E is unattainable, I target N_A. P_D is the second highest priority at N_A (Q_A[2]), right behind P_B (Q_A[1]). Since P_B is removed in Round 1 (matched with N_E), P_D becomes the highest priority remaining parent for N_A in Round 2.

3. Strategy:
If I submit my truthful preferences ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', ...]:
- R1: I apply to N_E, remain unmatched, but P_B is removed, clearing the path at N_A.
- R2: N_E is gone. I apply to N_A (my highest available choice). N_A identifies P_D (highest remaining priority). A cycle (P_D, N_A) forms, resulting in a match.

Submitting the truthful preference list leads to matching with N_A, which is my second-ranked true preference.

1.  **Nursery E (Rank 1):** Parent D is 4th in priority (behind E, B, A). In Round 1, $N_E$ identifies $P_E$, and a cycle forms leading to $P_B$ securing $N_E$. Parent D cannot overcome this high priority competition.

However, in the truthful scenario, $P_B$ gets $N_E$ (R1) and $P_A$ gets $N_B$ (R2). When $D$ applies to $N_A$ in R3 (having been rejected by $N_E$ in R1 and $N_A$ in R2), $D$ is the highest remaining priority parent identified by $N_A$, securing the match.
3.  **Lower Ranks (B, D, C):** These nurseries are highly competitive (D is 5th at B) or blocked by higher priority parents ($C$ for $N_D$, $E$ for $N_C$).

Attempting to strategically misreport (e.g., applying to $N_A$ first) resulted in D being rejected in R1 (as $N_A$ identified $P_B$) and subsequently missing out on $N_A$ entirely, as D was forced to apply to lower-ranked schools that were taken by others (leading to an unassigned outcome).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E prioritizes P_E (1st), P_B (2nd), P_A (3rd), and P_D (4th).

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): P_D is the 2nd highest priority at N_A, behind P_B. In Round 1, N_A identifies P_B, but P_B applies to N_E. N_A is not matched. In Round 2, P_B is gone.

If Parent_A applies truthfully to Nursery_E in Round 1, the applications are A->E, B->E, D->E, C->D, E->C. Nursery_E identifies Parent_E (highest priority).

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_B):
Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_A (N_B Priority: A > B > C...). If Parent_A applies to N_B, N_B will identify P_A. If this happens in Round 1, Parent_A will form a closed loop (P_A -> N_B -> P_A) and be matched immediately.

This mechanism structure, especially the fixed nursery identification pointer based on overall priority, requires analyzing the market structure to ensure optimal positioning.

1. Initial Analysis (Assuming True Preferences):
Parent C's True Preference List (TPL) is ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].

Round 1: Parent C applies to N_D. No cycle involving C is formed immediately. A cycle involving P_E, N_C, P_B, and N_E clears, matching (P_E, N_C) and (P_B, N_E).

Round 2: N_C and N_E are filled. C's top available choice is still N_D. P_A matches N_B via a direct cycle.

Round 3: N_B is filled. Remaining parents: C, D. Remaining nurseries: N_A, N_D. 
C's top available: N_D. D's top available: N_A.
Applications: C -> D, D -> A.
Identifications (among C, D):
N_A prioritizes D over C (A -> D).
N_D prioritizes C over D (D -> C).
Cycle formed: P_C applies to N_D, N_D identifies P_C. This is a direct match cycle (P_C <-> N_D).
Result: Parent C is matched with N_D, which is Rank 1.

This means that submitting the 'True Preference List' is the dominant strategy for Parent_D, guaranteeing the highest possible assignment given the priorities and choices of all other agents. 

Submitting the true preference list: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'] leads to the following outcome for Parent_D:

The matching mechanism is cycle-based, where a parent is matched if they are part of a closed loop formed by applications (P -> N) and identifications (N -> P). 

1. Analysis of Rank 1 ('Nursery_E'): Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E (1st) and Parent_B (2nd) above Parent_A (3rd). If Parent_A submits their true preference (E first), the applications (A->E, B->E, D->E, E->C) and identifications (E->E, C->B) lead to a cycle $N_E \to P_E \to N_C \to P_B \to N_E$.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 ('Nursery_B'): Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_A first overall ([A, B, C, E, D]). By ranking $N_B$ first, Parent_A applies to $N_B$.

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E priorities are (P_E, P_B, P_A, P_D, P_C). P_D is 4th priority. If everyone submits truthfully, in Round 1, P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E, and P_E applies to N_C.

P_D is eliminated from N_E in R1. Rank 1 is unachievable.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Nursery_A): N_A priorities are (P_B, P_D, P_A, P_C, P_E). P_D is 2nd priority. Since P_B (1st priority) is allocated N_E in R1, P_D becomes the highest priority available parent for N_A in Round 2.

2. Attempting Rank 2 (Nursery_B): Parent_A is the highest priority parent for N_B (N_B priorities: [A, B, C, E, D]). By submitting N_B as the first choice, Parent_A applies to N_B. N_B identifies Parent_A. This forms a direct closed loop in Step 1, guaranteeing immediate admission for (Parent_A, N_B).

Since Rank 1 is blocked by a dominant cycle involving other parents, securing Rank 2 (N_B) immediately in Step 1 by exploiting N_B's priority list is the optimal strategy. The remaining preferences are listed in their true preference order to guide applications in subsequent steps, although they are not expected to be needed.",False,Nursery_B,True,True,2

1. Analysis of Priorities: I (Parent_B) am the #1 priority for Nursery_A and Nursery_C, and #2 priority for Nursery_E. If I apply to Nursery_A or Nursery_C, I will be matched immediately in Step 1, resulting in Rank 5 or Rank 2, respectively, both worse than Rank 1.

2. True Preference List (TPL) Submission: My TPL starts with Nursery_E (Rank 1). When all parents submit their TPL, I apply to Nursery_E.

2. **Subsequent Rounds Analysis (Nursery_A, Rank 2):** Since N_E is filled, P_D aims for N_A. In the simulation where P_D submits true preferences, P_D fails in R1, and then applies to N_A in R2 (as N_E and N_C are filled). In R2, P_A secures N_B due to a direct cycle (P_A $	o$ N_B $	o$ P_A).

2. Rational Agent Analysis: To achieve Rank 1 (Nursery D), Parent C needs Parent A (Nursery D's highest priority parent) to be matched elsewhere early.
