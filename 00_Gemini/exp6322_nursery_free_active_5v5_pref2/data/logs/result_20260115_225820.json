Parent_E is ranked 1st at Nursery_E. Given that Nurseries only have capacity 1, it is highly likely that Parent_B, Parent_A, and Parent_D will prioritize applying to Nursery_E (their P1) in Round 1. If they apply to Nursery_E, they will compete there, leaving Nursery_C relatively uncontested. This gives Parent_E a strong chance to secure their P1 choice immediately.

Parent_E (Rank #4) has applied in Round 1. While Parent_E lists Nursery_C as their top choice, accepting them now would prevent me from matching with my top three choices (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D).\n\nReviewing the preferences of my top candidate, Parent_B: They list Nursery_E (1) and Nursery_C (2). It is highly probable Parent_B applied to Nursery_E this round. If Nursery_E accepts Parent_B, then my #1 choice is gone. However, if Nursery_E accepts Parent_A or Parent_D (less likely based on E's priorities), or if E rejects B for some reason (E's priorities: ['Parent_E', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_C']), Parent_B will move to their second choice, which is Nursery_C, in Round 2.\n\nSince Parent_B is my highest priority and lists me as their second choice, there is a strong incentive to hold my quota open for them in the next round.
