Nursery_A's top priority parent, Parent_B, is expected to apply to Nursery_E (P_B's 1st choice, where P_B is P2). If Parent_B is accepted by E (which is highly probable, as P_B is E's highest ranking applicant among those likely to apply), then Nursery_A's top candidate is removed from the pool.\n\nBy applying directly to Nursery_A in Round 1, I maximize my chances of securing my 2nd preference immediately, leveraging the fact that the P1 candidate (P_B) is likely diverted to their successful P1 match (E).

Since Parent_E is reapplying immediately, they are highly motivated and available, but accepting them now prevents me from matching with my top 3 choices if they become available in subsequent rounds. Given that P_A and P_D likely secured spots at nurseries where they were a higher priority (e.g., P_A is N_B's 1st priority), my primary remaining target is Parent_B (Rank 1).
