Applying to N_E in Round 1 guarantees rejection, forcing me to Round 2 negotiations.\n\nMy second choice is Nursery_A. I have the 2nd highest overall priority at Nursery_A. The parent with the highest priority (P_B) is applying to Nursery_E (their 1st choice). The other parents who might prioritize N_A (P_E) are applying to their own 1st choice (N_C).\n\nTherefore, applying to Nursery_A in Round 1 offers the highest probability of securing a high-ranked match immediately. If I apply, I will likely be the highest priority applicant N_A receives, leading to an immediate [ACCEPT]."

Since Nursery_B is not the top preference for any other parent, applying here in Round 1 guarantees a match at my 2nd preferred location, which is a highly efficient outcome.

Nursery_B ranks Parent_A 1st, making a match between them highly probable if Parent_A applied there.

Although Parent_E was rejected by Nursery_C in Round 1 (due to Parent_E being 4th priority), if the higher priority parents (Parent_B, A, D) have now matched with the other closed nurseries, Nursery_C must accept Parent_E if they wish to fill their remaining quota.

None of my top three priorities (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) have applied yet. Parent_B is my only realistic target among the higher ranks, but they are likely still pursuing Nursery_E (their P1). Rejecting Parent_E again carries the risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept Parent_C (my lowest priority) later, if Parent_B secures a spot elsewhere or continues pursuing Nursery_E. Since Parent_E is a high-quality applicant (P1 for them) and is acceptable (Rank 4 for me), securing this match now is the safer strategic choice to fulfill my quota."
