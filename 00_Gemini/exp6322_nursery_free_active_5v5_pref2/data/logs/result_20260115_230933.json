Given that Parent_E is only 4th priority at Nursery_C, it is uncertain where Parent_E will apply in Round 1. However, standard R1 behavior suggests applying to the true top preference (Nursery_C for P_E).\n\nIf Parent_E applies to Nursery_C, Nursery_E will receive applications from Parent_B, Parent_A, and Parent_D (all ranking N_E as their R1 choice). Since Parent_B is the 2nd highest priority at N_E (and highest among the likely applicants if P_E aims for N_C), applying now maximizes the chance of securing my Rank 1 match.\n\nIf Parent_E applies to Nursery_E, I will be rejected, but I can confidently move to Nursery_C (where I am 1st priority) in Round 2, which is unlikely to be taken by P_A or P_D since N_C is their lowest preference."
