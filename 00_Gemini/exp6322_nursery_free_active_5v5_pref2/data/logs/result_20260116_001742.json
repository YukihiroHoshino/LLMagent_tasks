Since P_B also ranks N_E as #1 and is 2nd priority, and P_E is 1st priority, applying to N_E in Round 1 is highly risky and likely leads to rejection.\n2. **Analyze Second Choice (Nursery B):** I rank N_B as #2, and critically, I am the 1st priority there. Furthermore, N_B is a low preference for most other parents (P_B #4, P_C #5, P_D #3, P_E #4). Applying here guarantees a successful match for my second-highest preferred option immediately.\n3. **Analyze Third Choice (Nursery D):** I rank N_D as #3, and I am also the 1st priority here. While safe, N_B is preferred over N_D.\n\nStrategy: Since the environment allows immediate matching upon application/acceptance, securing a high-ranked, guaranteed position is preferable to risking rejection on the top choice.

If Parent_B is rejected by Nursery_E, they will apply to me next round, and Parent_B is my highest priority.

Nursery_A is available and is Parent_E's highest remaining preference.\n\nAnalysis of competition: The other unmatched parent, Parent_D, also lists Nursery_A as their highest available choice (Rank 2). Crucially, Nursery_A ranks Parent_D 2nd, while Parent_E is ranked 5th (last). Therefore, if both apply, Parent_E will be rejected. \n\nHowever, Parent_E must still apply to Nursery_A in this round to exhaust their preference list in order. If Parent_E skips A and applies to C again, and A matches P_D, P_E risks missing the opportunity to formally receive a rejection from A, which is necessary before moving further down the list (although no other nurseries are available currently). Since A is Rank 2, I must formally apply."
