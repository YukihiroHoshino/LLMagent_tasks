Parent_B (Rank 1): Applying to N_E (1st choice). N_E will accept P_B (P_B is N_E's 2nd highest priority, and highest ranking applicant). P_B will be matched in R1.\n2. Parent_A (Rank 2) & Parent_D (Rank 3): Both rejected by N_E in R1. They rank N_C as their absolute last choice (5th).

Both N_A and N_B prioritize P_A and P_D highly and are expected to accept them in R2.\n\nConclusion: Waiting for P_A or P_D is highly unlikely to succeed, as they will match with their preferred nurseries in R2.

However, Parent_A's next preference is Nursery_B. Nursery_B is currently unmatched and Parent_A is Nursery_B's Rank 1 priority. This means Parent_A is highly likely to apply to and be accepted by Nursery_B in Round 2, preventing Parent_A from ever reaching me (Nursery_D is Parent_A's Rank 3).
