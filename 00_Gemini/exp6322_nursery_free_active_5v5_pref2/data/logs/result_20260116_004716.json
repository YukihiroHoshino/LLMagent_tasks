My top choice is Nursery_E, but I am ranked 4th there, and Nursery_E is the top choice for Parent_A and Parent_B, who are ranked 3rd and 2nd respectively by Nursery_E. It is highly likely I will be rejected by Nursery_E in Round 1 if I apply there.\n\nMy second choice is Nursery_A. I am ranked 2nd by Nursery_A. Based on the preferences of other parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_E all prefer other nurseries as their top choice), it is highly probable that Nursery_A will receive few or no higher-priority applications in Round 1. By applying to Nursery_A immediately, I maximize my chances of securing my second-ranked option in Round 1, eliminating the risk of further competition in subsequent rounds. This secures a high match (Rank 2) efficiently."

If they do, they will not apply to Nursery_C, leaving Nursery_C open to accept me, the highest-ranking applicant. \nTherefore, applying immediately to my top preference, Nursery_C, is the optimal strategy for Round 1."
