Parent_B's top preference is N_E, so P_B will apply there. Parent_A (Priority 3 for N_A) also prefers N_E (Rank 1).

Accepting Parent_D secures a high-quality match and fulfills my quota."

If Parent_E proposes elsewhere, Parent_B becomes the highest priority applicant proposing to Nursery_E (Parent_B is 2nd overall, ahead of P_A and P_D who also rank N_E first).\nGiven the competitive environment for N_E (three parents list it as their #1), I must formally [APPLY] in Round 1 to secure the spot if Parent_E skips it, or if Nursery_E follows the standard DA mechanism where they provisionally hold the highest-ranked applicant."

I observe that the three parents ranked higher than me at Nursery_C (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) all list Nursery_E as their first choice. Since Nursery_E has a capacity of 1, and Parent_B is the highest priority for Nursery_E among the competing parents, it is highly likely that Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_D will apply to Nursery_E first.

Parent_E is ranked 4th. I have a quota of 1 and Parent_E is the only applicant this round. While Parent_E is a willing partner (ranking me 1st), accepting them now means giving up the chance to secure my top priority, Parent_B (who ranks me 2nd overall). Given it is only Round 1, I should hold out for Parent_B, who is a much stronger candidate according to my preferences. Parent_A and Parent_D are unlikely to apply as they rank me 5th, so the risk is primarily losing Parent_E while waiting for Parent_B.

I will re-submit a formal application, emphasizing continued commitment, hoping that higher-priority candidates who provisionally held the spot have moved to their own preferred nurseries (e.g., Parent_B to Nursery_E).

My higher-ranked parents (Parent_A and Parent_D) both rank Nursery_C last (5th) in their preferences, making it highly unlikely they will apply soon. Parent_B (1st priority) likely pursued Nursery_E (Parent_B's 1st choice).
