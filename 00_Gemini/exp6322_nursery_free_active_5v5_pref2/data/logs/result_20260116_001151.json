Nursery_E (Rank 1): I am 4th priority (P_D) here. P_A (3rd priority) and P_B (2nd priority) also rank E first. It is highly likely I will be rejected in Round 1 if I apply here, as P_A and P_B will likely apply and one of them will be accepted.\n\n2. Nursery_A (Rank 2): I am 2nd priority (P_D) here. The 1st priority parent, P_B, ranks A last (5th) and will certainly apply to E or C instead. The other parent who ranks A highly (P_E, 2nd preference) is 5th priority at A and likely applying to C (P_E's 1st preference).\n\nSince securing an immediate match at Rank 2 (Nursery_A) is highly probable due to favorable priority and competitor behavior, this represents the optimal strategic move for Round 1 to ensure a high-quality outcome without risking delay or loss of opportunity."
