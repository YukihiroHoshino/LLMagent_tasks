At N_A, I am the 2nd highest priority applicant, right after Parent_B. Parent_B's top choice is N_E, meaning P_B will likely propose to N_E in Round 1.\nIf I bypass N_E and apply directly to N_A in Round 1, N_A will receive an application from their highest available priority candidate (me, P_D, rank 2). Since N_A is currently empty, they should accept immediately.

Both of these are strong matches for A and D (A is Rank 1 for B, D is Rank 2 for A).\n\nSince my top three priorities are unlikely to apply to Nursery_C in subsequent rounds (they are likely to match elsewhere), accepting Parent_E (Rank 4) guarantees a successful match and prevents me from remaining unmatched.
