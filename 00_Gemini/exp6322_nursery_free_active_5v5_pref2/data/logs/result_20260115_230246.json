Applying to Nursery_B guarantees an immediate match to my second preferred option, securing a high outcome without risking rejection and losing time/opportunity.

I am ranked 4th by Nursery_E, which means acceptance is unlikely if Parent_A and Parent_B also apply (which they likely will, as E is their top choice too). However, I must try.

While Parent_D has applied immediately, securing the spot, accepting them would lock me out of matching with Parent_E (1st priority), Parent_B (2nd priority), or Parent_A (3rd priority). Checking the preferences of higher priority parents: Parent_B and Parent_A both list Nursery_E as their 1st choice. Since it is only Round 1, it is strategically sound to reject a lower-ranked applicant (Parent_D) to remain available for my higher-ranked, highly interested candidates (Parent_B and Parent_A).

Applying here carries a significant risk of immediate rejection.\n2. Nursery_C (Rank 2): I am the 1st priority for Nursery_C.
