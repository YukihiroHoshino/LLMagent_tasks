It is highly probable that Parent_E will apply to their top choice (Nursery_C) in Round 1, leaving me as the highest priority applicant for Nursery_E among those likely to apply (P_A and P_D also prefer E highly, but I rank higher than both of them on E's priority list).\n2. Analyzing Nursery_C (P_B's #2): I am the 1st highest priority for Nursery_C. This is a guaranteed match if I apply.\n\nStrategy: Since securing Nursery_E is highly likely due to Parent_E's low preference for it, I should apply to Nursery_E immediately.
