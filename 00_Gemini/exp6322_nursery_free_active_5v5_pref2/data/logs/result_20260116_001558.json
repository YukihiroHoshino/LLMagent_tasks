P_B (P2 priority for N_E) is highly likely to secure N_E as N_E's P1 (P_E) is targeting N_C. Therefore, pursuing N_E in Round 1 will likely result in rejection.\n\nMy second choice is Nursery_A. I have P2 priority at Nursery_A (behind P_B). Since P_B is expected to match with N_E, I become the highest available applicant for N_A. By applying directly to N_A in Round 1, I secure my P2 choice immediately, minimizing the risk of competition from P_A (who is P3 priority at N_A but lists N_A as P4 preference). This strategic move ensures I achieve the stable outcome (N_A) without delay or intermediate rejection."

Accepting Parent_D secures a very high-priority match (P2) immediately. Rejecting them on the small chance Parent_B fails to match with their top 4 nurseries and then considers me is too risky, as Parent_D would likely match elsewhere.
