P_E will apply to Nursery_C.\n\nSince Nursery_E's top priority candidate (P_E) is applying elsewhere, I become the highest priority applicant at Nursery_E among those who prefer it highly (P_A and P_D also prefer N_E first, but I rank 2nd on N_E's list, while P_A ranks 3rd and P_D ranks 4th).\n\nTherefore, applying to Nursery_E in Round 1 is the dominant strategy to secure my Rank 1 preference."
