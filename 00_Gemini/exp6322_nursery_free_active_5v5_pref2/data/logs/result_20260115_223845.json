Parent_B also lists Nursery_E as their P1, making it highly likely that Parent_B will apply to E and secure the spot over me.\n\nMy second choice is Nursery_B. At Nursery_B, I (Parent_A) am ranked 1st in priority. If I apply to Nursery_B, I am guaranteed acceptance regardless of other applicants in this round. Securing a guaranteed match at my P2 choice in Round 1 is a strong strategic outcome, ensuring I do not risk falling further down my list by pursuing a near-impossible P1 match.\n\nTherefore, I will apply to Nursery_B."

Parent_B (ranked 1st at A) is targeting E. Parent_A (ranked 3rd at A) is also targeting E. By strategically applying to my second choice, Nursery_A, in Round 1, I maximize my chances of securing a high-ranked match immediately, as the competition ranked above me at A is likely occupied elsewhere. Since I am the highest priority applicant likely applying to A, I will use the [APPLY] tag."

The highest priority parent, Parent_E, ranks Nursery_E last (5th) and is expected to apply to their top choice, Nursery_C. Given that Nursery_E is also the top choice for Parent_A and Parent_D, immediate application is necessary to capitalize on Parent_B's high priority (2nd overall, likely 1st among active applicants).

Parent_B has submitted a formal [APPLY] in Round 1. My highest priority, Parent_E, has Nursery_E listed as their 5th (last) preference, making a future application from them unlikely unless all other options fail. Since Parent_B is a highly desired candidate and has committed early, securing this match immediately is the optimal strategy to fill my quota with a high-utility parent, rather than risking losing Parent_B while waiting for the highly improbable arrival of Parent_E."
