N_E prefers P_E (1st priority) over P_B (2nd priority). If N_E accepts P_E, P_B becomes available for N_C. If N_E accepts P_B, N_C loses P_B but P_E (Rank 4) is still available. Since P_E is applying aggressively (3rd application) and ranks N_C 1st, they are highly committed. However, the difference between Rank 1 (P_B) and Rank 4 (P_E) is substantial.

Nursery_C has previously rejected Parent_E (who is ranked 4th by C) three times, likely holding out for Parent_B, Parent_A, or Parent_D.
