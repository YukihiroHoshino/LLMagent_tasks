Parent_B's top choice, Nursery_E, likely matched with Parent_E (Nursery_E's Rank 1) in Round 1, meaning Parent_B should be moving to their second choice, Nursery_C, soon (likely R2 or R3). Since Parent_B did not apply this round, I must keep my slot open to maximize my utility.

However, Parent_E is applying to me, indicating they might not have secured Nursery_E yet (or N_E has rejected them, which is unlikely given P_E is N_E's top choice). Since Parent_A and Parent_D rank me last, they are highly unlikely to apply. The strategic choice is between securing Parent_E now (Rank 4) or holding out for Parent_B (Rank 1). Given that Parent_B is my top choice and I still have a good chance of attracting them if they are rejected by Nursery_E, I will reject Parent_E for a third time to keep my slot open for a higher-ranked Parent.
