This means if I applied to N_E, I would secure it, but it's my lowest preference.\n4. Assuming P_B, P_A, and P_D apply to their top choice (N_E), they will create a queue there. If I DO NOT apply to N_E, Nursery_E will accept P_B (their highest remaining priority applicant).\n5. If P_B applies to N_E, then N_C is free of its highest priority applicant. P_A and P_D are also likely at N_E. This leaves Parent_E as the highest priority applicant at N_C, allowing me to secure my 1st choice in Round 1.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy in Round 1 is to apply aggressively to my top choice, Nursery_C, relying on the competition to target the highly desirable Nursery_E."

Nursery_E ranks P_B 2nd, and since Parent_E (Nursery_E's 1st priority) applied to me (Nursery_C), Nursery_E is highly likely to accept P_B, making P_B unavailable.\n2. Parent_A (2nd Priority) and Parent_D (3rd Priority) both rank me 5th (last). It is extremely improbable they will approach me in early rounds.\n\nIf I reject Parent_E, there is a high risk of missing out on a match entirely, as my higher priorities are either likely matched elsewhere (P_B) or will ignore me (P_A, P_D).
