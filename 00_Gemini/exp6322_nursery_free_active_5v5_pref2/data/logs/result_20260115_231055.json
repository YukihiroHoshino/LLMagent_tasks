I am the 2nd highest priority at Nursery_A (after Parent_B). Parent_B's top choice is E, and B is highly likely to be accepted by E (over P_A and P_D).\nIf Parent_B is matched with E, I become the highest priority applicant available for Nursery_A. By strategically applying to Nursery_A in Round 1, I secure my 2nd preference immediately, which is a highly efficient outcome given the competitive landscape for Nursery_E. I will use the [APPLY] tag to lock in this match."
