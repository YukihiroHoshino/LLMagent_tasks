However, the three parents ranked higher than me (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) all list Nursery_E as their top preference (P1). Given that Nursery_E only has one spot, it is highly likely that these parents will apply there in Round 1, potentially leaving Nursery_C open, or at least reducing the effective competition. Specifically, Parent_B is the highest priority applicant at Nursery_C. If Parent_B applies to Nursery_E (their P1 choice), and assuming Parent_B gets Nursery_E (as they are high priority there), then the path to Nursery_C becomes much clearer for me. I will apply immediately to my top choice, Nursery_C, leveraging the expected concentration of applications at Nursery_E."

Parent_E is ranked 4th on my priority list (P_B, P_A, P_D, P_E, P_C) but has applied directly in Round 1, indicating strong commitment (Nursery_C is their first choice). My higher priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_D) all prefer Nursery_E first. Assuming rational play, P_B likely secured a spot at N_E (N_E's 2nd choice). P_A and P_D were rejected by N_E, but they still have 3 or 4 nurseries ranked higher than me before they would consider applying to N_C. If I reject Parent_E now, it is highly probable that P_A and P_D will match with N_A or N_B in Round 2, leaving me unmatched. Since Parent_E is a willing and viable match (Rank 4), securing them now minimizes the risk of ending up unmatched."
