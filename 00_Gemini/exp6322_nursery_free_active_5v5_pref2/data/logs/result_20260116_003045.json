It is highly likely Parent_B (2nd priority at N_E) will secure the spot in R1, leading to my immediate rejection.\n\n2. Target Nursery_A (P2): I am 2nd priority at N_A. Crucially, Parent_B (1st priority at N_A) lists N_E as their P1 and is likely to be accepted by N_E in R1. This leaves N_A open.\n\nBy strategically applying to Nursery_A in Round 1, I maximize my chances of securing my second-best preference immediately, utilizing my high priority ranking there, while avoiding the highly competitive and low-probability attempt at Nursery_E.
