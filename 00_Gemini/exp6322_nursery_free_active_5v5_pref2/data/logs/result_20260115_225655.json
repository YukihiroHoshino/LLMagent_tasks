I must analyze the competition for Nursery_C.\n\nParent_E's Rank at Nursery_C is 4th (behind B, A, D).\n\nHowever, I predict that Parent_B, Parent_A, and Parent_D will all apply to their own top choice, Nursery_E, in Round 1 (since Nursery_E is the top choice for A, B, and D).\n\nIf A, B, and D apply to E, then Nursery_C may receive few or no applications from parents ranked higher than me. The only other strong competitor for C is Parent_C (C's 2nd choice), but Parent_C's 1st choice is D.\n\nIf I apply to Nursery_C, I stand a very good chance of being the only applicant or the highest-ranked available applicant, securing my 1st choice immediately.
