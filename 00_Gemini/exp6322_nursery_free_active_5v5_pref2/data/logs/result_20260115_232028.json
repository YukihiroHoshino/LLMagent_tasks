Parent_A (Rank 1) has Nursery_D as their 3rd choice and is likely applying to Nursery_E or Nursery_B this round.

I am Parent_E, and I am ranked 4th in priority at Nursery_C (P_B, P_A, P_D rank higher).\n\nHowever, P_B, P_A, and P_D all rank Nursery_E as their 1st choice. Nursery_E has P_E (myself) as its top priority, but P_E prefers C.\n\nPredicting Round 1 applications:\n1. P_A, P_B, P_D are highly likely to apply to Nursery_E.\n2. When Nursery_E processes applications, P_B (2nd priority at E, 1st choice) is likely to be accepted, as P_E is not applying there.\n3. P_A and P_D are rejected by E and will look for their 2nd choices (B and A, respectively).\n4. P_C applies to D (1st choice).\n\nIf P_B, P_A, and P_D apply to E, then Nursery_C will likely only receive an application from P_E (since C is P_E's 1st choice, and C is P_A/P_D's 5th choice).\n\nTherefore, applying to Nursery_C aggressively in Round 1 has a high chance of success, securing my 1st preference immediately."

Given that I have not received applications from my higher-ranked parents and my chances of getting them later are low (as P_A and P_D rank me 5th), securing a guaranteed match with Parent_E (who ranks me 1st) in Round 1 is the most prudent strategy to fill my quota."

If all three apply, Nursery_E will accept Parent_B (who is ranked 2nd by E), and Parent_A will be rejected.\n2. Analyzing Nursery_B (Rank 2): Nursery_B ranks Parent_A first. Furthermore, B is not the top choice for any other parent. Assuming other parents apply truthfully to their top choices (E, D, C), Parent_A is likely the sole applicant to Nursery_B in Round 1.\n\nSince the environment allows for immediate binding matches, securing Rank 2 (Nursery_B) in Round 1 is the optimal strategy, as it prevents delay and guarantees a highly preferred placement, whereas applying to Rank 1 (Nursery_E) guarantees rejection in this round. I will apply formally to Nursery_B."
