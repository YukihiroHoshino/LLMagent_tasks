If I apply, I am guaranteed acceptance, regardless of who else applies.\n3. Nursery_D (My 3rd choice): I am 1st priority. If I apply, I am guaranteed acceptance.\n\nSince this is a negotiation environment where a match is permanent, securing my 2nd choice immediately (N_B) is a safer and highly desirable outcome compared to risking rejection at N_E and potentially having to settle for N_D or lower if N_B somehow fills up later (though unlikely based on current data).\n\nI will apply to Nursery_B to secure a high-ranked match instantly."

If Parent_E applies to Nursery_C, Nursery_E will receive applications from Parent_A (3rd priority), Parent_B (2nd priority, me), and Parent_D (4th priority).

Given Nursery_E's priorities, Parent_B is likely to match with Nursery_E in R1.\n2. Parent_A (P2) ranks me #5 (last).\n3. Parent_D (P3) ranks me #5 (last).\n\nSince P2 and P3 rank me last, the chance of them applying to me is extremely low unless they are rejected by four other nurseries. Parent_E (P4) applied to me immediately and ranks me #1. Rejecting P4 carries a very high risk of failing to match with P1, P2, or P3, and potentially ending up with P5 (Parent_C) or unmatched.\n\nAccepting Parent_E (P4) secures a match with a parent who is highly motivated and relatively high on my list, mitigating the risk of being left with only lower priority options or an unfilled quota.
