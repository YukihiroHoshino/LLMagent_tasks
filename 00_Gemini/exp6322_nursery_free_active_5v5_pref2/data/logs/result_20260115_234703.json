Since Nursery_E only has one spot, and Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_E (P1) over P_B (P2), P_A (P3), and P_D (P4), there is a high chance that if I apply to Nursery_C, my main competitors (A, B, D) will be applying to Nursery_E or matched there. If A, B, and D all apply to N_E (their P1), N_E will accept P_B (P2 among applicants, assuming P_E applies elsewhere). This leaves N_A and N_D available for P_A and P_D, but they might also target N_C.

Parent_E must either secure a match with Nursery_C or remain unmatched. Since Nursery_C is P1, Parent_E must apply again, despite the previous rejection in Round 1. The previous rejection likely occurred because Nursery_C was holding out for higher priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_A, or Parent_D). If those parents have matched elsewhere in R1 (which is likely, given that C is the only remaining option), Parent_E's chance of acceptance increases.
