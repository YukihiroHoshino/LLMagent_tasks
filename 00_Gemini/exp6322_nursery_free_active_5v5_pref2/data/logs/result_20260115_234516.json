If they all apply to Nursery_E (which is highly likely in Round 1), Nursery_C might receive few or no applications from parents ranked higher than me.\nTo maximize the chance of securing my P1 choice immediately, I must formally apply.

Parent_E, my 4th preferred parent, has submitted an immediate [APPLY]. While Parent_E is highly committed (I am their #1 choice), accepting them now would prevent me from matching with my top three choices (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D).\nParent_B lists me as their second choice, after Nursery_E. It is highly probable that Parent_B applied to Nursery_E this round. If Nursery_E rejects Parent_B (Nursery_E prefers Parent_E, who applied to me, and Parent_B is their #2 priority), Parent_B will likely apply to me in Round 2. Waiting one round provides a high chance of securing my Rank 1 preference. Therefore, I will politely reject Parent_E to keep my quota open for higher-ranked candidates."

Applying to N_E in Round 1 is likely a waste of a turn.\n\nMy second choice is Nursery_A. At Nursery_A, I hold the second-highest priority (P2). Crucially, the parent with the highest priority (Parent_B) ranks Nursery_A last on their list (P5).
