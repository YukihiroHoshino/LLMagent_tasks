However, the three parents ranked higher than me (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) all list Nursery_E as their top choice. Given that Nursery_E has a capacity of 1, and Parent_B has the highest priority at Nursery_E among A, B, D (if Parent_E doesn't apply to E), it is highly likely that Parent_B will match with Nursery_E in Round 1. Parent_A and Parent_D will be rejected by E and will move down their lists in subsequent rounds. Since Nursery_C's top competitors are focused elsewhere in Round 1, applying directly to my top choice, Nursery_C, offers a high chance of immediate acceptance and securing my most preferred outcome."

Parent_E (rank 4) has applied and listed Nursery_C as their first choice. \n\nI must evaluate the likelihood of my higher-ranked parents (B, A, D) applying to me. \nParent_B, Parent_A, and Parent_D all prefer Nursery_E first. Based on the overall market preferences, it is highly likely that they will be matched with their higher preferences (Nursery_E, B, or A) in this round or the next, as they are highly ranked by those nurseries. None of them applied to me in Round 1.\n\nSince my top three preferences are likely unavailable, and Parent_E is my 4th preference and has initiated a firm application ([APPLY]), accepting Parent_E is the safest strategy to secure a match, preventing me from potentially ending up unmatched or forced to accept Parent_C (rank 5). I have 1 quota, and Parent_E is the best available candidate right now."
