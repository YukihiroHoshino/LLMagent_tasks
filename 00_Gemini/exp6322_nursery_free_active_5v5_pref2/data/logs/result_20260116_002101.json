I received only one application this round, from Parent_E, who is reapplying aggressively and stating I am their first choice. My top three choices (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) did not apply this round, suggesting they are pursuing matches with their own higher preferred nurseries, or have already been matched (e.g., Parent_A likely matched with Nursery_B, their top priority). Holding out for Parent_B (my Rank 1) is risky, as they skipped applying to me this round (their Rank 2) and likely targeted Nursery_D (their Rank 3). If I reject Parent_E, I risk remaining unmatched, as my higher priorities are moving down their own preference lists away from me.
