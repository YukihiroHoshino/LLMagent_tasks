My highest priority, Parent_A, likely applied to their own top choices (Nursery_E or Nursery_B). Nursery_B ranks Parent_A as their #1 priority, making it highly probable that Parent_A will be matched elsewhere in Round 1.

Parent_A is 3rd priority there, and Parent_B (2nd priority, N_E is their 1st choice) is highly likely to secure the spot.\nNursery_B (Rank 2) is a very safe option. Parent_A is 1st priority at Nursery_B. Applying here guarantees an immediate match at a high rank (Rank 2) and avoids the risk of being rejected in Round 1 and potentially facing further competition in Round 2 for lower-ranked schools. Given the goal is to match as high as possible, securing the guaranteed second choice immediately is the most strategic move."

I am ranked 4th.\nHowever, the three parents ranked above me (P_B, P_A, P_D) all list Nursery_E as their absolute first choice.

Although Parent_E is not my absolute top priority, I must consider the likelihood of securing Parents ranked 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D). Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_C as P5, making them highly unlikely to apply unless all other options fail. Parent_B ranks Nursery_C as P2, but likely applied to Nursery_E (P1 for them). Given that Parent_E is a strong applicant (P1 preference for me) and the uncertainty of securing higher-ranked parents who have better options, accepting Parent_E in Round 1 is a stable and strong outcome, guaranteeing my quota is filled."
