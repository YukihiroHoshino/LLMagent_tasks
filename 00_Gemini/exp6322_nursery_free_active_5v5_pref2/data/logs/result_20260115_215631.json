P_A, P_B, P_D apply to Nursery_E.\n2. P_C applies to Nursery_D.\n3. P_E applies to Nursery_C.\n\nResult at Nursery_E: P_E did not apply. Nursery_E accepts Parent_B (P2 priority).\nResult at Nursery_C: Only P_E applied. Nursery_C accepts Parent_E.\n\nThis strategy maximizes my utility by securing my P1 match, relying on the predictable behavior of my main competitors (A, B, D) aiming for their shared P1 (Nursery_E). I will send an immediate formal application."

Since Parent_E (N_E's 1st priority) applied to me, N_E is highly likely to accept P_B (N_E's 2nd priority). Thus, P_B is likely unavailable.\n2. Parent_A (Rank 2) and Parent_D (Rank 3): Both rank me 5th. It is extremely unlikely they will apply to me in the immediate future, as they would need to be rejected by 4 other nurseries first.\n\nGiven that my top three choices are either likely matched elsewhere or highly unlikely to apply, accepting Parent_E (Rank 4) is the best available outcome, securing a match immediately rather than risking going unmatched."
