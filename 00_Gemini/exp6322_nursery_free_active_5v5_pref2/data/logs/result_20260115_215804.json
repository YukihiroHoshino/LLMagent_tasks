Given that Parent_B's top preference is Nursery_E, Parent_B is likely to apply to Nursery_E in Round 1. If Parent_B secures Nursery_E, or even if they apply to Nursery_E and are accepted (which is likely, as they are 2nd priority at N_E), Nursery_A's top priority applicant (Parent_B) is removed from contention for N_A.\n\nThis makes Parent_D the de facto highest priority applicant for Nursery_A who is likely to apply (Parent_D ranks N_A 2nd).

In Round 1, I rejected them to hold out for my top 3 priorities (P_B, P_A, P_D). None of those higher priorities have applied in Round 2. Since P_A and P_D rank Nursery_C last, it is highly unlikely they will apply unless all their higher options fail.
