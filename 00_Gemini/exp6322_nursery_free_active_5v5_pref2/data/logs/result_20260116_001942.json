Since Nursery_E also prioritizes Parent_E (1st priority for N_E), if I applied to N_E, I would be accepted (Rank 5 match guaranteed).\n\nBut since my top choice, N_C, is likely to be ignored by its top priorities in Round 1 due to the strong pull of N_E, this presents a perfect opportunity to secure my Rank 1 choice immediately.

Their next choices are N_B and N_A, respectively, where they are high priorities (P_A is N_B's #1, P_D is N_A's #2).\n5. It is improbable that P_A or P_D will apply to Nursery_C (P_A's #5 choice, P_D's #5 choice) in Round 2, as they have much better alternatives.\n\nTherefore, rejecting Parent_E risks ending up unmatched or matching with Parent_C (Rank 5).
