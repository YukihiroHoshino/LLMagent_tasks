While Parent_A is ranked 1st by Nursery_D, Parent_A's top preference is Nursery_E. Assuming parents follow their true preferences, Parent_A will likely apply to Nursery_E.

Given that Parent_A is unlikely to reach me in this round, accepting the guaranteed high-priority match with Parent_C is the optimal strategy to fill my single quota."

However, the three parents ranked above me (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) all list Nursery_E as their number one preference. Given that this is Round 1, it is highly likely that these three parents will apply to Nursery_E first. If they all apply to Nursery_E, I become the highest-priority applicant remaining at Nursery_C. Therefore, I will take the calculated risk and formally apply to my top choice immediately to try and secure the match."

Parent_E is my 4th preference, but they have applied immediately, indicating I am their 1st preference. My top choice, Parent_B, lists Nursery_E as their 1st preference, making it likely they applied there. Given that Parent_A and Parent_D rank me 5th, they are unlikely to apply unless rejected multiple times. Assuming Parent_B is likely to be accepted by Nursery_E (as P_B is N_E's 2nd priority, and P_E applied to me instead of N_E), my best realistic available match right now is Parent_E. Accepting Parent_E guarantees a match and fulfills my quota, which is preferable to risking being unmatched while waiting for unlikely applications from higher-ranked parents."

Parent_E's top preference is Nursery_C. Assuming all parents apply to their absolute top choice in Round 1 (standard stable matching behavior): Parent_E will likely apply to Nursery_C. If Parent_E applies to Nursery_C, Nursery_E will be available to me, Parent_B (their P2 priority). This makes applying to Nursery_E a high-reward, calculated risk strategy.
