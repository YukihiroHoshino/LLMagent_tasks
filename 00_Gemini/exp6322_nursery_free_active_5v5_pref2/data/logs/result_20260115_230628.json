Analyzing the preferences, Parent_E is ranked higher than me by Nursery_E, but Parent_E's top choice is Nursery_C. Assuming all parents apply to their top choice in Round 1, Nursery_E will receive applications from P_A, P_B, and P_D. Among these three, Parent_B (me) is ranked 2nd overall by Nursery_E, making me the highest priority applicant in this round (P_E applied elsewhere). Therefore, applying directly ([APPLY]) to Nursery_E offers the best chance to secure my absolute top choice immediately."

My top three preferences (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) are unlikely to apply to me in Round 1: Parent_A and Parent_D rank me last (5th), and Parent_B targets Nursery_E (their 1st choice).
