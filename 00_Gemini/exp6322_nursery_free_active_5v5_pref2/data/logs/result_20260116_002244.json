Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_E. Parent_A is ranked 3rd at Nursery_E, which is likely to receive applications from P_B (ranked 2nd at N_E) and possibly P_D (ranked 4th at N_E).

Since I am the next highest priority applicant for Nursery_D, applying immediately gives me the best chance of securing my rank 1 choice.\n\nI will send an [APPLY] request to Nursery_D."

While Parent_A (Rank 1) is preferred, Parent_A lists two other nurseries (Nursery_E and Nursery_B) above me. Nursery_B ranks Parent_A first, making it likely Parent_A will match there if they applied. Given the high priority of Parent_C and the certainty of securing a match with them immediately, accepting Parent_C is the optimal strategy to maximize utility and secure a stable outcome in Round 1."

My higher-ranked parents (P_B, P_A, P_D) all rank me relatively low (2nd, 5th, 5th) and have not applied to me in Round 2, suggesting they are pursuing higher preferences elsewhere.
