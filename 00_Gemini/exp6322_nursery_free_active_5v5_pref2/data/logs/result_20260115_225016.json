Given the overall preference landscape, it is highly likely that Parent_A will apply to Nursery_E (as will Parent_B and Parent_D). This leaves Parent_C as potentially the highest priority applicant for Nursery_D in Round 1. Therefore, I should immediately apply to secure my top choice."

Parent_B (My 1st choice) applied to Nursery_E (P_B's 1st choice). N_E prioritizes P_B (2nd) highly.

Parent_A (My 2nd choice) and Parent_D (My 3rd choice) rank me 5th and 5th, respectively. Even if they are rejected by their top choices (N_E), they have several other nurseries they prefer before me (N_B, N_D, N_A).\n\nSince securing P_B, P_A, or P_D in subsequent rounds is highly improbable, accepting Parent_E (my 4th priority) who is enthusiastic and applied immediately is the best strategy to maximize my match quality within the constraints of the market and secure my single slot now.
