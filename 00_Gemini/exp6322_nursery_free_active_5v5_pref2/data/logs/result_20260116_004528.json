Crucially, the parent ranked 1st (Parent_B) lists Nursery_A as their last choice (5th), suggesting they will apply elsewhere (likely Nursery_E). Therefore, applying immediately to Nursery_A gives me a very high probability of being accepted in the first round, securing my second-best outcome immediately rather than risking rejection and losing time pursuing my top choice where competition is fierce."

Therefore, applying to Nursery_E is likely to result in a rejection.\n\nI check my second preference, Nursery_B. Nursery_B ranks Parent_A #1 in their priority list. It is highly unlikely that any other parent will apply to Nursery_B in Round 1, as all other parents prefer other nurseries that rank them higher or equally high (P_B, P_D prefer E; P_C prefers D or C; P_E prefers C).\n\nSince I am the top priority at Nursery_B, and it is my second choice, applying immediately guarantees a stable match early in the process.

Since Nursery_E is highly competitive (likely attracting P_A, P_B, and P_D), it is probable that Nursery_C will not receive proposals from its top candidates (P_A, P_B) in Round 1.
