If Parent_B applies to E, I become the highest priority applicant for Nursery_A.\n\nTo maximize guaranteed utility in Round 1, securing my 2nd choice (Nursery_A) is a safer and highly strategic move, as it capitalizes on the likely competition for Nursery_E among higher-priority agents.\n\nI will apply immediately to Nursery_A."
