My higher ranked parents (P_A and P_D) list N_C as their last choice (Rank 5), making them virtually impossible to secure. My top choice, P_B, lists N_C as their second choice. Since P_B has not applied by Round 3, it is highly probable they have matched with their first choice, Nursery_E. If P_B is unavailable, P_E becomes the best realistic match candidate, given their strong commitment. Delaying further to wait for P_A or P_D is futile, and risking the loss of P_E (who might match elsewhere if continuously rejected) is unwise. Therefore, I will secure the match with Parent_E now."
