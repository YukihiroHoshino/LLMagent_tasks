This suggests that N_C's higher priority parents (Parent_B and Parent_D, and likely Parent_A) have matched with other nurseries (A, D, E).\n\nBased on the likely stable R1 outcome, Parents B, C, and D are matched. Parent A is likely targeting N_B (their Rank 2 preference). If Parent A applies to N_B, N_B will accept A (A is N_B's highest remaining priority). This leaves N_C potentially only receiving Parent E's application.\n\nSince N_C is still open, Parent_E must re-apply to their first choice, N_C, to maximize utility, as the constraints that led to the R1 rejection (i.e., N_C hoping for a higher priority applicant) are likely resolved now.
