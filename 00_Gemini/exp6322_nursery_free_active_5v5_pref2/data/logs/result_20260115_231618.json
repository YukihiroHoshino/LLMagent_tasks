P_C ranks Nursery_D as P1. \n\nAssuming all parents propose to their P1 in Round 1:\n- P_A, P_B, P_D propose to N_E.\n- P_C proposes to N_D.\n- P_E proposes to N_C.\n\nSince the three parents preferred over me at N_C are likely proposing elsewhere, I am highly likely to be the only applicant, or at least the highest-ranked applicant proposing to Nursery_C. Therefore, I should formally apply immediately to secure my top choice."

Parent_B (Rank 1) prefers Nursery_E (P1) and Nursery_C (P2). There is a reasonable chance P_B applied to N_E this round. If P_B is rejected by N_E, they might apply to me in subsequent rounds.\n2. Parent_A and Parent_D (Ranks 2 & 3) rank me P5, making early applications highly unlikely.\n\nAccepting Parent_E secures a match immediately, but locks me out of my top 3 preferences.

I will politely reject Parent_E for now, keeping my quota open for higher-ranked applicants."

Nursery_C ranks me 4th (behind P_B, P_A, P_D).

Parent_A and Parent_D rank me last (5th), making them highly unlikely candidates unless all their preferred nurseries reject them.
