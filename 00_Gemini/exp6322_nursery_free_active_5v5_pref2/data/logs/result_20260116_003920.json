Parent_C has submitted a formal [APPLY] and states Nursery_D is their first choice. Since I only have a quota of 1, securing my P2 match in Round 1 is an excellent outcome. My P1 choice, Parent_A, ranks me P3 on their list, suggesting they likely applied to Nursery_E or Nursery_B this round. Waiting for Parent_A carries significant risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept a much lower-ranked parent later. Therefore, accepting Parent_C now is the optimal strategy."

They likely applied to Nursery_E and will be rejected if B is accepted. Their next choice is Nursery_B (P2). They have me as P5.\n3. Parent_D (P3 for me) prefers Nursery_E (P1). They likely applied to Nursery_E and will be rejected. Their next choice is Nursery_A (P2).
