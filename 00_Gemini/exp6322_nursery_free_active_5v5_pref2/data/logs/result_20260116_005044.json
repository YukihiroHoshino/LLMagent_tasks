Since Parent_A and Parent_B both list N_E as their Rank 1 choice, and they both rank higher than me, applying to N_E in Round 1 is highly likely to result in immediate rejection, wasting the round.\n\n2. Analyzing Nursery_A (Rank 2): I am 2nd on their priority list (P_B > P_D > P_A...). The parent ranked 1st (Parent_B) has N_E as their Rank 1 choice and is 2nd priority there, making it highly probable P_B targets N_E first. If P_B targets N_E, I become the highest priority applicant at N_A who is applying (as N_A is my 2nd choice).

Parent_D, my 2nd priority, has applied in Round 1 and explicitly stated a full commitment.
