1. Initial Stable Matching Analysis (Truthful Reporting):
If Student A submits the truthful list ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'], the standard DAA simulation results in the stable matching M = {(A, E), (B, D), (C, B), (D, C), (E, A)}. Student A is matched to School E (Rank 4). Furthermore, this stable matching M does not generate any 'blocking students' as defined in Part 2, meaning the process ends here.

2. Feasibility of Higher Ranks (B, C):
Student A has low priority at School B (Q5) and School C (Q5). Since other students (C, D, E, B) are ranked higher than A at B and C, and B and C are the top choices for C and D, A cannot secure B or C in Round 1, regardless of A's submitted list order, unless A assumes other students misreport, which we cannot rely on. Therefore, ranks 1 and 2 are unattainable.

3. Testing Rank 3 (School A):
I tested submitting School A first: ['School_A', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_D']. This manipulation successfully secured a temporary admission at School A in R1, displacing Student B. This action initiated a cascade of temporary admissions and rejections across the market.

4. Part 2 Blocking Student Resolution:
The simulation required multiple reruns (Reruns 1-5) due to the creation of blocking students (C and D had their lists shortened). The process stabilized only after C's list was reduced to [E, A] and D's list was reduced to [B, E, D].

The final stable outcome M''''''' reached after all waivers were applied and no further blocking students were found was: {(A, A), (B, B), (C, E), (D, D), (E, C)}.

Student A's final match is School A (Rank 3). Since Rank 3 is better than Rank 4 (achieved by truthful reporting) and Ranks 1 and 2 are infeasible due to priority constraints, this list is optimal for Student A.",False,School_E,True,False,4

In a market where capacities are 1, it is a dominant strategy for students (the proposing side) to submit their true preferences to guarantee receiving the highest ranked stable match possible based on their preferences.

I first calculated the outcome (M1) assuming all students submit their true preferences:
A->E (4), B->B (2), C->C (2), D->A (3), E->D (2).

Part 2 involves iterative reruns based on 'blocking students' (students who temporarily held a spot and caused a rejection, but ultimately matched elsewhere). This mechanism penalizes strategic holding of spots but does not inherently change the fact that the resulting stable matching (if one exists) found via truthful DA is student-optimal.

I simulated the full process using Student B's true preference list:
1. Initial DA (Truthful): B matches with School B (2nd choice).
2. Part 2 Rerun 1 (D waives B): B matches with School B (2nd choice).
3. Part 2 Rerun 2 (C waives B): B matches with School B (2nd choice).
4. Part 2 Rerun 3 Check: No further blocking students found. Final outcome is M3.

Round 1: Student_C applies to School_B. School_B receives applications from A, C, D. School_B's priority list ranks C (3rd) higher than D (4th) and A (5th). School_B accepts C. (C, B) is a temporary match.

Student D's True Preference: ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'].

1. Analysis of True Preference Submission: Submitting the true list ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'] leads to an initial stable match M_S where Student D gets School C (2nd choice). However, the Part 2 cascade (triggered by Student C blocking at School B, and subsequent waivers) leads to D eventually being matched to School D (5th choice) or becoming Unmatched, depending on the stabilization path.

2. Strategic Deviation: D cannot secure School B (1st choice) because Student C is ranked higher by School B and C prefers B first. D cannot secure School C (2nd choice) because Student D (D's own priority, 1st) and Student E (4th) are preferred by School C.

3. Targeting School A (3rd choice): D is ranked 2nd at School A (priority list: E, D, A, B, C). If D applies to A first, D competes directly with B (who applies to A first) and E (who applies to C). Running the DA simulation with D submitting ['School_A', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_D'] results in an initial match M''' where D gets School A (3rd choice). 

4. Stability Check for M''': This match is unstable under Part 2, as D is identified as a blocking student at A (since D eventually matches to E). This forces D to waive A, leading to a rerun where D is matched to School E (4th choice) in the subsequent stabilized state.

Since School A (3rd choice) > School E (4th choice) > School D (5th choice) > Unmatched, the best outcome D can achieve through strategic submission, even considering the cascade, is School E.

I will first simulate the outcome assuming Student E submits their true preferences, as deviating is generally suboptimal unless specific knowledge about the non-standard Part 2 suggests otherwise.

Student E's True Preference List (P_E): ['School_C', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B'].

1. Initial DA (Part 1, using P_E truthfully):
   - R1: S_E proposes to H_C (P1). S_E is accepted provisionally.
   - R2: S_D (P2 for S_D) proposes to H_C. H_C prefers S_D (3rd priority) over S_E (4th priority). H_C accepts S_D, rejecting S_E.
   - R3: S_E proposes to H_D (P2). S_E is accepted provisionally, leading to the outcome S_E -> H_D (True 2nd choice).

2. Part 2 (Blocking Student Check):
   - The initial run identified blocking students (S_A and S_D in specific steps), leading to the removal of H_A from S_A's list and a re-run (Iteration 2).

1. Initial DAA (Submitting True Preferences [B, C, D, E, A]): The stable matching M_2 resulted in Student C matching to School C (Rank 2). However, this matching generated blocking students (C at B, D at C).

My top choice, School C, prefers Student D (3rd priority) over me (Student E, 4th priority). Since D prefers C over their final match (D's rank 2 vs 5), D will successfully obtain C, making C unattainable for me. My highest stable match is School D (2nd preference).
2. Blocking Student Check (Part 2): I analyzed the history of provisional matches in the DA outcome (M1). A student is 'blocking' only if their temporary admission caused a rejection AND they later left that school. In M1 = {(A, A), (B, E), (C, B), (D, C), (E, D)}, every student who provisionally held a seat and caused a rejection ultimately stayed at that school (e.g., C at B, D at C). Therefore, no blocking students are found, and the matching M1 is the final result.
3. Conclusion: Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof, and no manipulation could grant me my Rank 1 choice (C is structurally unattainable due to D's higher priority), the optimal strategy is to submit my true preference list to secure the best stable outcome, which is School D (Rank 2).

1. True Preference Submission: If Student D submits the true list ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'], the initial stable match (M*) results in D matching with School A (3rd choice). Subsequent Part 2 adjustments do not improve this outcome for D.

In a standard Deferred Acceptance (DA) simulation using true preferences, Student E is blocked from C by S_D and blocked from D by S_C, resulting in a match with School A (Rank 3).

2. Analyze the mechanism (Part 2: Blocking Student Check): If Student E reports truthfully (C, D first), S_E is temporarily admitted to C and D during the process, but ultimately rejected, leading to a final match M(E) = A.

   - S_B cannot secure H_A because H_A prefers S_D (who is matched there) over S_B.

Therefore, in the stable matching M, no student meets the criteria to be a 'blocking student,' and Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

Round 1: S_C secures H_B (over S_A, S_D). S_B secures H_A. S_E secures H_C.
Round 2: S_D secures H_C (over S_E, S_A). S_E is rejected.

Next, I analyzed Part 2, the 'blocking student' check. A student S is blocking at H if (1) S's temporary admission at H caused other students to be rejected from H, AND (2) S's final match differs from H. 
In M0, the students who moved away from a TA were S_B (H_A -> H_E) and S_E (H_C -> H_D).

2. S_E at H_C (R1 TA): S_E was the only applicant in R1. No rejection was caused by S_E's TA at H_C. S_E is not blocking.

   - School_A is automatically removed from Student_A's preference list.

3. DA Rerun (M2):
   - With Student_A no longer applying to School_A, Student_B applies to School_A in Round 1 and holds the position, as Student_B is the highest priority remaining applicant (Student_E, who is higher priority, applies to School_C).

1. Initial DA Run (True Preferences $P_A$): Submitting $P_A = ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D']$ results in the initial stable matching $M_T$, where Student_A matches with School_A (Rank 3).

   The DAA simulation based on true preferences shows that Student_B initially applies to School_A (R1) and is temporarily accepted.

   Student_B is ranked P4 at School_A. Since School_A prefers Students E (P1), D (P2), and A (P3) over B, B cannot secure School_A even if B applies first, provided those students eventually propose to A.

3. Analyze potential for Rank 2 (School_B):
   Student_B is ranked P2 at School_B, which is superior to Student_C (P3), Student_D (P4), and Student_A (P5).

1. Analyze TPL submission: Submitting TPL leads to D matching School E (4th choice) in M1. The subsequent Part 2 iterations (due to blocking students D, C, E) cause the matching to become unstable, potentially resulting in D matching School D (5th choice) in subsequent reruns.

2. Analyze Strategic Submission for B (1st choice): D has low priority (4th) at School B and would be rejected by Student C (3rd priority) immediately if C applies there.

3. Analyze Strategic Submission for A (3rd choice): D has high priority (2nd overall, only behind E) at School A. By applying to A first, D maximizes the chance of securing a high-ranked school immediately.

Simulation of D_A: In the first run (M1_A), Student D successfully matches with School A (3rd choice).

Rerunning Part 1 with these waivers (M2_A) resulted in the identical matching: (A, D), (B, C), (C, E), (D, A), (E, E). This matching M2_A was found to be stable and generated no new blocking students, finalizing D's outcome at School A (3rd choice).

1. Initial DA Run (Truthful Submission): Running the DA algorithm using Student E's true preferences ['School_C', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B'] results in a temporary stable match where Student E is matched with School_A (3rd choice).

1. Analysis of True Preferences: If Student D submits their true list [B, C, A, E, D], the initial DA outcome M_DA is D -> School_A (3rd choice). However, D is identified as a blocking student at School_C because D temporarily matched C (R2), causing S_E and S_A to be rejected, but D ultimately moved to A. Part 2 forces D to remove C. Rerunning the process leads to D eventually matching School_D (5th choice).

2. Strategic Manipulation: To prevent the detrimental effects of Part 2, D must avoid being a blocking student at School_C, where D is rejected by a higher priority student (S_B). The simplest way to achieve this is to skip School_C entirely, preventing D from causing rejections there.

3. Testing the Strategic List: Submit P_D = [B, A, E, D] (skipping C).
   - DA Execution (Part 1): After running the DA algorithm with this list, the stable matching M' results in D matching School_A (3rd choice).

4.

   Running the DA algorithm with all truthful preferences results in the stable matching M = {(S_A, H_A), (S_B, H_E), (S_C, H_B), (S_D, H_C), (S_E, H_D)}.
   Student_D is matched with School_C, which is their second choice.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Students):
   Part 2 checks for 'blocking students'—those who caused rejections while temporarily admitted but ultimately moved elsewhere. In the standard DA outcome M, every student who caused a rejection (S_C at H_B, S_D at H_C, S_A at H_A) ended up being matched to that school permanently. Students who moved (S_B, S_E) did not cause any rejections at their initial temporary schools. Therefore, no blocking students are identified in M.

3. Conclusion on Strategy:
   Since the resulting match M is stable, and Part 2 does not alter the outcome M, the final result for Student_D is School_C. Due to the strategy-proof nature of the underlying DA algorithm, Student_D cannot achieve their first choice (School_B) because they are ranked lower than S_C by School_B (S_D Prio 4, S_C Prio 3). Any attempt to manipulate the list would likely result in an outcome equal to or worse than School_C. Thus, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy.",True,School_A,True,False,3

Simulating the DA process (Part 1) with Student A's true preferences reveals the stable allocation:
1. Student A applies to School B (Rank 1) but is rejected in Round 1 because School B prefers Student C (Rank 3 priority) over Student A (Rank 5 priority).
2. Student A applies to School C (Rank 2) but is rejected because School C prefers Student E or later Student B (Rank 4 and Rank 1 priority, respectively) over Student A (Rank 5 priority).

1. Analysis of Truthful Reporting (P_B = [A, B, C, D, E]): The initial DA run (M1) resulted in Student B matching with School D (4th choice). However, M1 was unstable in the Part 2 sense because Student C was identified as a blocking student at School B. This triggered a rerun (Run 2), where B's list remained unchanged but C's list was modified. The final stable matching (M2) after this iteration resulted in Student B matching with School E (5th choice).

2. Analysis of Strategic Reporting: Student B prefers School A (1st) and School B (2nd). School A has B as 4th priority, making it difficult to secure. School B has B as 2nd priority (P_B: [E, B, C, D, A]). If B proposes to School B first, B has a high chance of securing it, preventing B from being rejected multiple times and potentially avoiding the instability cascade.

   Student E applies to School C (1st choice). In Round 2, Student D, who is preferred by School C (D is 3rd priority, E is 4th), applies to and secures School C, rejecting E. E is eventually matched with School A (3rd choice).

2. Attempt to achieve School C (1st choice):
   Since School C strictly prefers Student D over Student E, E cannot obtain School C if D applies there before E is permanently matched elsewhere, regardless of E's submitted list.

3. Attempt to achieve School D (2nd choice):
   If Student E submits School D as the 1st choice, E is temporarily accepted by D in Round 1. This prevents E from applying to C immediately. Meanwhile, Student D applies to School B (1st choice), gets rejected, and then applies to School C (2nd choice), where D is accepted. Since D is now matched with C (E's highest preference, but unattainable for E), E remains matched with D, which is E's 2nd choice.

4. Verification of Strategic Outcome (M'):
   Submitting P'_E = ['School_D', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B'] results in the matching M' where Student E is matched with School D. This outcome (2nd choice) is superior to the outcome M1 (3rd choice).

5. Part 2 Check:
   The matching M' has no blocking students as defined in Part 2, as all students who caused rejections were ultimately matched to the schools they temporarily held. Thus, M' is the final assignment.

Conclusion: Submitting School D first, followed by the rest of the true preference order, maximizes Student E's outcome by securing the highest attainable school (School D).",False,School_D,False,True,2

1. Analysis of Attainability (Based on True Preferences):
   - Target School B (Rank 1): Students C (3rd priority) and D (4th priority) both prefer B first. I am 5th priority at B. I will be rejected by B in favor of C (M(C)=B).
   - Target School C (Rank 2): Student D (3rd priority) proposes C in Round 2 (after being rejected by B). I am 5th priority at C. D will secure C (M(D)=C).
   - Target School A (Rank 3): I secure A in Round 3, beating Student B (I am 3rd priority, B is 4th priority).

1. True Preference Simulation: If Student_B submits the true preference list ['School_A', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_E'], the resulting Student-Optimal Stable Matching (SOSM) yields a match with School_D (4th choice). This is because Student_E (1st priority at School_A) eventually proposes to School_A and displaces Student_B in Round 3.

2. Strategic Analysis: Student_B's highest achievable preference is likely School_B (2nd choice), where Student_B has the 2nd highest priority (after Student_E). Student_E prefers School_C and School_D over School_B, meaning School_B is often available early.

3. Strategic Submission: By submitting ['School_B', 'School_A', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_E'], Student_B proposes to School_B in Round 1. School_B receives proposals from S_A, S_B, S_C, S_D. Since Student_B has the highest priority among these applicants (2nd overall priority for School_B), Student_B is immediately admitted and held by School_B.

4. Outcome Verification: This strategic move results in the final match M = { (S_A, H_E), (S_B, H_B), (S_C, H_C), (S_D, H_D), (S_E, H_A) }. Student_B achieves School_B, which is the 2nd choice, improving upon the 4th choice achieved by truthful submission.

5. Part 2 Check: In this strategic outcome, all students who caused rejections while temporarily admitted (S_B at H_B, S_C at H_C, S_E at H_A, S_A at H_E) ended up matched with that school. Therefore, no 'Blocking Students' are found, and the match is final.

Since School B is unattainable due to Student C's higher priority and preference, and attempting to misreport to aim for School A (Rank 3) yields a worse outcome (School A, Rank 3), reporting the true preference list is the optimal strategy to secure the Rank 2 match (School C).",True,School_B,False,True,1

In the standard DA mechanism, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for students to secure the best possible stable match. Part 2 introduces a complexity related to 'blocking students' (similar to instability issues often seen in the Boston mechanism), which triggers a rerun of Part 1 with modified lists for the blocking students. However, this corrective mechanism (Part 2) is designed to ensure a final stable outcome, but it cannot improve a student's outcome beyond what the stable matching achieved by the true preferences allows.

1. Analysis of True Preferences: Running the DA algorithm (Part 1) using Student E's true list ['School_C', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B'] showed that Student E was initially admitted to School C but was eventually rejected by School C in favor of Student B (who has higher priority at C and applied later). E ultimately matched with School D (2nd choice).
2. Stability Check (Part 2): Although the initial match was D, the system identified E as a blocking student (at School C, where E caused rejections but ultimately moved to D), triggering reruns. After multiple reruns and waivers for other students (E, D), the final stable matching achieved was E -> D.
3. Manipulation Check: Since E's failure to secure C was due to the immutable priority ranking of School C (C prefers Student B over Student E), E cannot bypass this constraint by manipulating their own list. Any attempt to hide C or shift the application order failed to yield a better result than D, and in one simulation led to a worse outcome (School B).

   - Student C temporarily matched B (R1) but finalized at C. C waives B.
   - Student D temporarily matched C (R2) but finalized at A. D waives C.
   - Student A temporarily matched A (R3) but finalized at E. A waives A.

3. Rerun DA (Part 1 with Waivers):
   The system runs DA again using the new, shortened preference lists (D's list becomes ['School_B', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D']).
   The resulting stable matching M' = { (A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D) }.

4. Final Outcome Check:
   In M', Student D matches with School B, which is their 1st choice. Furthermore, checking M' reveals no further blocking students, meaning the process ends here.

In standard SPDA, submitting true preferences is the weakly dominant strategy for students to secure the best possible stable match according to their preferences (the Student-Optimal Stable Matching, SOSM).

1. Initial DA (Truthful Preferences):
   The stable matching (M) is calculated: {S_A: H_E, S_B: H_C, S_C: H_B, S_D: H_A, S_E: H_D}. Student D matches with School_A (Rank 3).

2. Blocking Student Check (Part 2):
   The initial match M is unstable due to blocking students. Specifically, S_A becomes a blocking student at H_A (Round 3 rejection of S_B), and S_D becomes a blocking student at H_C (Round 2 rejection of S_E, S_A). The last blocking event occurs in R3 (S_A at H_A).

3. Waiver and Restart:
   School_A is removed from S_A's list. The DA restarts.

4. Strategic Analysis:
   Student D's highest preference, School_B (Rank 1), is matched to Student_C in M'. School_B's priority list shows Student_C (P3) is preferred over Student_D (P4).

1. Analyze True Preferences (P_A): Running the DA algorithm with all true preferences leads to the Student-Optimal Stable Matching M_S. A detailed simulation showed that M_S results in Student A being unmatched (A -> U).

I analyzed why Student_A failed to secure higher preferences (B, C, A): Student_A has low priority at all three schools (5th at B, 5th at C, 3rd at A) compared to the students who ultimately matched there (e.g., C/E at B, B/E at C, D at A). Since Student_A cannot displace these higher-priority students, strategic manipulation (like listing a lower preferred school first) is highly unlikely to improve the outcome and carries the significant risk of resulting in a worse match (e.g., School D or being unmatched, as demonstrated by testing deviations).

In standard DA with unit quotas, submitting true preferences is generally the optimal strategy for students, as the resulting matching is student-optimal among all stable matchings.

I simulated the process assuming all students submit their true preferences (including Student B submitting [A, B, C, D, E]):

1. Initial DA run (Truthful preferences): Student B applies to School A (1st choice), is temporarily admitted, but is later rejected by School A in favor of Student A (due to School A's priority ranking: Student A > Student B). Student B subsequently matches with School B (2nd choice).
2. Part 2 iteratively modifies the input lists, leading to a complex final matching (M'''). In the final converged outcome (M'''), Student B matches with School B (2nd choice).
3. Hypothetical Deviation: If Student B strategically submits School B first (e.g., [B, A, C, D, E]), analysis shows that Student B secures School B early, leading to a different path of waivers for other students. However, the resulting final matching still yields School B for Student B.

When Student_B applies to School_A (P1), School_A rejects S_B in Round 3 in favor of S_E (P1 priority for A) and S_A (P3 priority for A), as S_B only has P4 priority at A. S_B subsequently matches with School_D (Rank 4).

While the inclusion of Part 2 adds complexity, it is designed to resolve temporary instability caused by students who move on, and it does not generally create incentives for a student to misrepresent their preferences initially, as misrepresentation could lead to missing out on a preferred option unnecessarily.

Simulating the DA process using Student_A's true preferences ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'] reveals that Student_A faces significant priority constraints: A is ranked 5th at B and C, and A's 3rd choice (School_A) prefers Student_E (1st priority) who eventually applies there.

1. Initial Run (Truthful Submission): If all students submit their true preferences, the Part 1 outcome is M = {(S_A, H_E), (S_B, H_B), (S_C, H_D), (S_D, H_C), (S_E, H_A)}. Student B gets School B (2nd choice).

2.

   The initial run results in a temporary matching M_T1: (A, A), (B, B), (C, D), (D, C), (E, E). Student B is matched to School B (Rank 2).
2. Part 2 Iteration 1:
   Blocking student C (at School B, R1) is identified and waives School B. Rerunning Part 1 (I2) yields M_T2: (A, E), (B, B), (C, C), (D, A), (E, D). B remains at School B (Rank 2).
3. Part 2 Iteration 2:
   Blocking student A (at School A, R3) is identified and waives School A. Rerunning Part 1 (I3) yields M_T3: (A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D).
   Student B is matched to School A (Rank 1).
4. Final Check:
   No further blocking students are found in M_T3. This matching is the final stable outcome M_F.

Since submitting the true preference list ultimately leads to the highest possible outcome (School A, Rank 1) for Student B after the mechanism fully executes, this list is the optimal choice. Deviation carries a high risk of disrupting the sequence of waivers that benefited B, potentially leading to a worse outcome (e.g., remaining at Rank 2, School B, or worse, as demonstrated in the silent thought process).",True,School_A,False,True,1

The matching environment uses a Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm with an iterative waiver process (Part 2) based on 'blocking students'.

1. Initial Analysis (Submitting True Preferences: [B, C, D, E, A]): Running the standard DA (Part 1) results in a stable matching where Student C is matched with School D (Rank 3).
2. Part 2 Execution: This initial stable matching leads to the identification of blocking students (A at School A, C at School B). The mechanism forces iterative waivers.
    a. Waiver 1 (A waives A): Rerunning DA results in C still being identified as a blocking student at B.
    b. Waiver 2 (C is forced to waive B, resulting in submitted list [C, D, E, A]): Rerunning DA results in C matching School C (Rank 2). This is an improved outcome. D is now identified as a blocking student.
    c. Waiver 3 (D waives B): Rerunning DA again results in C matching School C (Rank 2). No further blocking students are found, and the process terminates.

3. Conclusion: The best possible outcome achieved for Student C through the full execution of the mechanism, starting from true preferences, is School C (Rank 2).

4. Strategic Consideration: If I were to preemptively waive School B and submit [C, D, E, A], the overall process still leads to the stable outcome where C is matched with School C (Rank 2), as confirmed by running the simulation starting with that strategic list. Since submitting the true preference list [B, C, D, E, A] preserves the maximum chance of obtaining the absolute favorite (School B) while achieving the highest final stable outcome (School C, Rank 2) after the mechanism's iterative corrections, submitting the true list is the optimal strategy.",True,School_C,False,True,2

Furthermore, the rules governing Part 2 explicitly state that the automatic waiver applied to blocking students 'will never change your final admission but may improve other Students' final admissions.'

Part 2 introduces a modification to address 'blocking students' by automatically waiving certain schools from a student's list and rerunning the process. Crucially, the rules state that this modification 'will never change your final admission.' This confirms that Student_E's final outcome is determined by the initial run of the DA algorithm (Part 1) based on the submitted preferences.
Therefore, the optimal strategy for Student_E is to submit their true preference list: ['School_C', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B']. (Simulation confirms this yields School_D, E's 2nd choice, which is the student-optimal outcome).",True,School_D,False,True,2

1. Initial Analysis (True Preferences $L_T = [B, C, A, E, D]$): Executing Part 1 (DA) with truthful submissions for all agents results in an initial matching $M_1$. Detailed simulation shows that $M_1$ is unstable under the Part 2 criteria (e.g., student A becomes a blocking student for School A, or student D becomes a blocking student for School C, depending on minor calculation variations). Rerunning the process with modified lists ultimately leads Student_A to match with School D (Rank 5).

2. Deviation Analysis: Attempts to deviate (e.g., prioritizing Rank 3 School A first, or prioritizing Rank 4 School E first) were tested to see if they could prevent the chain reaction that led to the degradation of Student_A's match. These deviations either resulted in an even worse outcome (Rank 6, Unmatched) or, after the Part 2 mechanism stabilized the matching, still resulted in School D (Rank 5).

3. Conclusion: Since submitting the True Preference List $L_T$ yields the highest calculated rank (School D, Rank 5) that survives the full complex mechanism, it is chosen as the optimal strategy, as deviations do not demonstrably improve the outcome and carry significant risk of obtaining a worse match.",True,School_E,True,False,4

The matching process is based on the Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA), followed by a check for 'blocking students' (Part 2). Since DAA is generally strategyproof, deviation is usually only beneficial if the competitive structure allows securing a highly preferred choice early, or if the Part 2 mechanism affects stability in a way that benefits lying (which is unlikely in this setup, as the final stable matching is usually achieved). 

1. Analyze True Preferences Submission: If Student B submits ['School_A', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_E'], the DAA outcome (M_DA) results in B matching with School D (Rank 4). This happens because B applies to School A (Rank 1) in Round 1, is temporarily accepted, but is rejected in Round 3 when Student E (Priority 1 at A) applies.

2. Analyze Potential for Higher Ranks:
    a. Rank 1 (School A): Student B has low priority (4th) at School A, behind Student E (1st) and Student D (2nd). Since E and D both prefer A and apply before B is matched elsewhere, B cannot secure A.
    b. Rank 2 (School B): Student B has high priority (2nd) at School B, behind only Student E (1st). Student E's first preference is School C, meaning E will apply to C in Round 1. This leaves School B open for Student B to claim.

3. Strategic Submission Test: By submitting School B as the first choice, Student B secures the spot immediately in Round 1, as B has higher priority than the other applicants (A, C, D) at School B. 

Choice Ranking List: ['School_B', 'School_A', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_E'].

The matching process involves the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1) followed by an iterative waiver process for 'blocking students' (Part 2).

1. Initial Analysis (Submitting True Preferences [B, C, D, E, A]): Running the full DA process (Part 1) yields M1, where Student_C matches School_D (3rd choice). However, Student_C is identified as a blocking student at School_B (R1 admission caused others' rejection, but C moved to D), leading to School_B being waived from C's list. Subsequent reruns (M2, M3) lead to Student_C eventually matching School_E (4th choice).

2. Strategic Analysis: Since the blocking student mechanism penalizes students who secure a highly preferred spot temporarily but move elsewhere, Student_C must strategically avoid becoming a blocking student at School_B (their 1st choice). Given C's low priority at School_B (3rd), C is highly likely to be rejected or displaced from B, leading to the waiver of B.

3. Optimal Strategy: By starting the application process at School_C (their 2nd choice), Student_C secures a stable match higher than the outcome achieved by submitting true preferences. If Student_C submits [C, D, E, A], the DA process stabilizes quickly (M_C3), resulting in C matching School_C (2nd choice on the True List). This outcome is stable against blocking students based on the modified preference lists used in the final rerun, and represents the highest possible rank C can achieve without causing the cascading waivers that push the match down to E.

4. Submitted List: To achieve School_C, C must rank it first. Schools D, E, A are ranked according to C's true preferences relative to C.

Student E's True Preference List (P_E) is ['School_C', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_B'].

1. Testing the truthful submission P_E: Executing DA with all true preferences resulted in Student E matching with School D (Rank 2).

2. Testing strategic submissions: Student E's true first choice, School C, has Student D ranked higher (Rank 3 vs E's Rank 4). If E proposes C first, E is rejected early, leading to a worse outcome.

   *   Result: A matches School E (Rank 4). Crucially, this outcome resulted in no 'blocking students' under the Part 2 definition, meaning the process terminates immediately.
