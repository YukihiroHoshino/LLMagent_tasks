My primary goal is to secure the highest possible match, preferably Parent_C, before settling for Parent_E. Parent_E's message uses the [TALK] tag but signals extreme commitment and urgency, essentially giving an ultimatum. Since they did not use the [APPLY] tag, I am not forced to make an accept/reject decision. I must use this opportunity to acknowledge their commitment and continue to defer the final decision, maintaining the option to match with Parent_C if they apply in the next round, or waiting for Parent_E to formally apply again."

Parent_C has formalized their application and confirmed immediate commitment.

I have previously applied to my 4th choice, Nursery_B, without success, despite multiple follow-ups. Given the high priority and the lateness of the round, applying to Nursery_E guarantees a match, preventing me from potentially remaining unmatched, which is worse than matching with my 5th choice.
