Given that nurseries C, D, and B are likely matched, and I need to secure an allocation, matching with Nursery_E is a guaranteed safety net, even though it is my lowest preference. Securing a guaranteed match at this stage (Round 4) is preferable to risking being unmatched while waiting for a response from Nursery_A, where my priority is lower (3rd).
