Since Parent_A and Parent_C, my top two priorities, are still unmatched and available, I must reserve my single quota for them, especially Parent_C who ranked me as their first choice.

While Parent_A might apply elsewhere, Nursery_D is too important to risk losing by delaying the application. Since this is Round 4 and no match has been confirmed, immediate application is the best strategy to maximize the chance of securing my highest preference, regardless of whether Parent_A chooses to apply here or not.

Our typical class size is capped at 12 children with 2 dedicated educators, resulting in an excellent 1:6 ratio, which allows for deep engagement and individualized support.\n\nRegarding staff rotation, consistency is a core value here. We are proud of our high staff retention rate, and we actively minimize internal rotation within classrooms. This commitment ensures that your child can develop secure, trusting relationships with their primary educators, which is foundational to their emotional and academic growth.
