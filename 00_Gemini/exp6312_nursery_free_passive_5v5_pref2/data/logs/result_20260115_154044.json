I still have my full quota of 1 available, and all four higher-priority parents (P_E, P_B, P_A, P_D) are unmatched. Accepting Parent_C now would immediately close my allocation and prevent me from matching with any of my preferred candidates, especially Parent_E (my #1) with whom I have had very positive interactions. Since it is still early (Round 7), I must continue to hold out for a higher-ranked match. I will reject Parent_C for the third time."

Since the simulation is in Round 8 and no matches have been confirmed, Nursery_E is likely still holding out for one of the four higher-priority parents (E, B, A, D).

Given the high preference rank, the action must remain [APPLY], emphasizing unwavering commitment."
