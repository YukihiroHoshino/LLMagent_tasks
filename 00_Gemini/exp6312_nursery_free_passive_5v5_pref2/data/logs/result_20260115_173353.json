We actively foster a strong sense of community through several channels: we host monthly 'Family Fridays' where parents are invited to participate in classroom activities or attend specialized workshops focused on child development. We also have a very active Parent Association that organizes social events, volunteer opportunities, and fundraising efforts, creating a robust support network among families. Furthermore, we maintain open lines of communication through weekly newsletters and scheduled parent-teacher conferences to ensure everyone feels connected and informed. Does this sound like the kind of supportive community you are seeking?",

Our protocols for drop-off and pick-up are designed to be thorough and efficient. Access to the building is controlled via a secure, keyed entry system, and only authorized personnel are permitted beyond the main reception area during school hours. Specifically for drop-off and pick-up, we utilize a standardized, visual identification system: only individuals listed on the authorized pick-up form (which requires photo ID verification) are allowed to collect the child. Teachers conduct a direct, visual handover to the authorized adult, logging both the time and the individual responsible. We also conduct regular safety drills and maintain strict teacher-to-child ratios to ensure constant supervision. We hope this comprehensive overview provides the final confirmation you need regarding our commitment to a secure environment. We are highly prepared and eager to finalize our allocation with your family.",

Although Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_E fourth, given the late round (7) and the unmatched status of Nursery_B, it is highly probable that the higher priority parents (A, B, C) have matched to the now-closed nurseries.
