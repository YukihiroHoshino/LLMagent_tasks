Since my chances are very low, a direct [APPLY] is likely to result in an immediate rejection, potentially signaling desperation and closing the door prematurely. I have better chances with Nursery_A (ranked 2nd by them) and Nursery_E (ranked 4th by them). I will continue to use [TALK] to express strong commitment and reinforce why we are a good fit for their program, hoping to differentiate myself from the higher-priority parents who might be targeting their absolute top choices (like Nursery_E)."

Since I have higher priority parents available (Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_E), I must not accept Parent_D yet, but I also cannot risk alienating them entirely if higher-ranked options fall through.
