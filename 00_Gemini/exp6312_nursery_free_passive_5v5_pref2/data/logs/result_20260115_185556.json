Since Nursery_A is still unmatched in Round 4, it means all higher-priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D) have either matched elsewhere (likely D and E are matched) or are prioritizing other remaining options (C or B). If higher-ranked parents are now focusing on C or B, Parent_E's chance at A slightly increases, but only if they demonstrate maximum commitment. Applying ([APPLY]) again, despite the low priority, is the most active appeal possible and ensures we don't lose the spot to a slightly lower-priority parent if others withdraw interest, or if Nursery_A decides to prioritize commitment over strict ranking among the remaining pool.
