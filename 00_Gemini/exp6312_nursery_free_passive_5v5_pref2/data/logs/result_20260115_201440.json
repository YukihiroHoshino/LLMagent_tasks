Given that Parent_C (Nursery_D's 2nd priority and their 1st choice) is likely to apply to Nursery_D, my chances of acceptance are low, and securing a match here would prevent me from applying to higher-ranked schools in subsequent rounds if this process allows only one match.

Since I rank low (4th) on Nursery_A's priority list, applying now is risky; I might be rejected, or accepted, which would lock me into a low-preference match while my top choice D is still open. I have already engaged in two 'TALK' rounds with Nursery_A, showing sustained interest. I need to maintain this interest without committing, reserving my application for Nursery_D. Therefore, I will use [TALK] to keep the conversation warm and inquire about the status of their application review process."

We appreciate your patience and look forward to concluding the process soon.",

Parent_C is currently engaging in [TALK] and seems keen on receiving a decision timeline, indicating they are finalizing their choices. I need to keep Parent_C engaged and interested, potentially prompting them to apply, but I must maintain flexibility to accept Parent_D if they approach. I will provide a polite but non-committal response regarding the timeline, emphasizing the comprehensive nature of the review process, thus delaying any hard commitment while keeping my options open for Parent_D."

Parent_C has applied, stating that Nursery_D is their absolute top preference (Rank 1 for them). While Parent_A (Rank 1) is theoretically preferred, Parent_A ranks me third, making a successful match uncertain. Accepting Parent_C secures a highly desirable, high-priority match, fulfilling the quota with a minimal risk of missing out on Parent_A.
