Mornings typically focus on core learning and outdoor time, while afternoons involve quiet activities, naps/rest, and specialized enrichment. Concerning parent involvement, we highly value our community. Opportunities include volunteer reading sessions, chaperoning field trips, participating in school-wide events (like our annual Spring Festival), and regular parent-teacher conferences. We also utilize a dedicated communication app for daily updates and feedback. We look forward to receiving your application when you are ready.",

Parent_D is currently engaging in detailed [TALK] exchanges, indicating high interest in securing a spot, even though Nursery_D is their 4th preference. Since I have not secured a higher-ranked parent yet and only have one quota, I must keep Parent_D interested as a strong backup. I will answer their questions thoroughly to appeal actively and maintain momentum, utilizing the [TALK] action."
