Since Parent_E sent [TALK] in this round, the rules mandate that I must respond with [TALK]. I cannot [ACCEPT] or [REJECT]. My strategy must be the final, most urgent demand to perform the required administrative action ([APPLY]). If Parent_E sends [TALK] again in the response phase of this round (which is not possible within the current turn structure), or if the simulation ends after this response, the match will fail due to their consistent failure to apply. I must make it absolutely clear that this is the final moment and that the use of [TALK] guarantees failure."
