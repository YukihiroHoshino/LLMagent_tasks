This means the negotiation is highly critical. Although Nursery_C ranks me 4th, it is highly likely that the three higher-ranked parents (P_B, P_A, P_D) have already secured matches at their higher preferences (Nursery_E, A, B, D are all matched). Therefore, Parent_E is likely the highest available applicant for Nursery_C.
