We are truly honored that you have chosen us as your first preference repeatedly. As we have now reached the absolute final stage of our admissions process and have finalized our cohort structure, we are delighted to inform you that we are now in a position to offer you the placement. We look forward immensely to welcoming your family to Nursery_C.",

I have a quota of 1 and am currently unmatched. I previously rejected Parent_E twice, hoping higher-ranked parents (P1, P2, P3) would apply or become available. It is Round 7, and Parent_E is listed as the only remaining unmatched Parent. Since securing a match is critical, and Parent_E is on my list, accepting P4 is the optimal strategy at this late stage to fulfill my quota, as waiting further guarantees I remain unmatched. Parent_E is applying for the third time, showing strong commitment."
