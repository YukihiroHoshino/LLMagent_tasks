              "message": "Good day, Parent_E. Thank you for raising that excellent question; it shows a deep understanding of early childhood development. We pride ourselves on maintaining ratios that support both structured learning and independent exploration safely. During structured learning periods, we operate with a dedicated ratio of 1 staff member to every 5 children to ensure focused instruction. For free play, where we actively encourage self-directed discovery and confidence building, we maintain a strong ratio of 1:7. We believe this balance is crucial. We are very keen on families who prioritize independence, and we hope you will feel confident moving forward with your application.",

Although Parent_E ranks Nursery_E as their last choice (Rank 5), I must engage enthusiastically to encourage them to apply, as securing this match is optimal for me. Parent_E sent a [TALK] message asking for specific details, which indicates they are still evaluating their options. I must reply with [TALK], provide a detailed and attractive answer, and strongly signal my high interest to sway their decision towards applying to me next."

Since I have high leverage and the market is still fluid (Round 4), I should not commit to my lowest preference yet. I need to keep Nursery_E warm as a guaranteed fallback while I pursue my higher preferences (C, A, D, B) in future rounds, where my priority is lower. Therefore, I will send a [TALK] message to maintain interest without formal commitment."

Parent_E is still engaging in communication ([TALK]) and considers us a 'very strong contender,' despite being low on their stated preference list. My goal is to secure P1 as quickly as possible. Since Parent_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK], but I need to make the message highly appealing and urgent, pushing them towards submitting a formal [APPLY] in the next round, capitalizing on their positive sentiment from the previous exchange.
