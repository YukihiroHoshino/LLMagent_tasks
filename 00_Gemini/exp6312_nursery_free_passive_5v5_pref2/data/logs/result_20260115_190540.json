Since the market is thinning out (only N_A and N_E remain), and N_A is still unmatched, it implies that the parents ranked above Parent_E (P_B, P_D, P_A, P_C) are either matched elsewhere or focusing on their 1st choices (N_E is P_D's 1st choice, and N_E prefers P_E). I must try to secure N_A, as it is my highest remaining preference. I will apply aggressively again, hoping that my main competitor for N_A (likely Parent_D) chooses to apply to their 1st choice (N_E), where Parent_E is highly preferred."
