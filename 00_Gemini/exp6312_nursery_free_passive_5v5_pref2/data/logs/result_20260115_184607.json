Parent_B (Rank 1) is the main opportunity cost, but Parent_B ranks Nursery_C 2nd and may match with their top choice, Nursery_E.

Your enthusiasm for our program and your child’s alignment with our ethos is precisely what we look for in our community members. Given the careful consideration we have given to your family and the strong suitability we recognize, we are pleased to offer you a place immediately, effective for the upcoming academic year. We look forward to welcoming you to the Nursery A family!",

They have submitted a formal [APPLY] and explicitly stated that Nursery_A is their absolute strongest preference after their top choice, promising to accept immediately. While Parent_B (P1) is technically preferred, Parent_B ranks Nursery_A last (5th) in their preferences, making an application from them highly uncertain. Given that I have a quota of 1 and Parent_D is a highly desirable, confirmed applicant, securing this match now is the optimal strategy to maximize utility and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked or no match. I will accept Parent_D."
