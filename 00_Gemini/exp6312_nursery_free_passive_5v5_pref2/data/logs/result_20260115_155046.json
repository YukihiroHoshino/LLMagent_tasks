Crucially, Parent_A is ranked as the absolute highest priority (Rank 1) on Nursery_B's priority list. Since I have a guaranteed acceptance here, and Nursery_B is a highly desired choice, I should apply immediately to secure this match and prevent potential future regret if my top choice (Nursery_E) doesn't work out or if I lose this spot later. Securing a strong second choice early is optimal."

Accepting Parent_C (P2) guarantees an excellent match, especially since they are highly motivated (D #1 choice). Rejecting P2 to wait for P1, who shows less relative interest in me, is too risky given the single quota constraint. I will accept Parent_C to secure a high-priority match."
