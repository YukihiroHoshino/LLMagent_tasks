Numeracy is explored through hands-on, play-based learning, focusing on conceptual understanding—such as spatial awareness, measurement, and pattern recognition—before formal arithmetic. We are particularly careful to ensure that learning is engaging and tailored to the child's developmental stage. We want to reiterate that you are highly prioritized for our limited opening, and we are eager to see if we can be the perfect fit for your family.",
