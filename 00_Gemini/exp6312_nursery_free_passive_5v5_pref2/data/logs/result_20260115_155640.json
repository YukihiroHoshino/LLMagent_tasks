Since I have a guaranteed match here, and the competitive environment suggests I am unlikely to secure a higher-ranked school that has low priority for me, it is strategically sound to secure this guaranteed spot now to avoid the risk of being unmatched later. I will formally apply."

Since Nursery_B has a quota of 1 and has not yet matched, accepting Parent_C would secure a match. However, the objective is to match with the highest possible priority. Parent_A (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2) are still available. Since it is still relatively early (Round 4), and Parent_C ranks Nursery_B 5th, they are likely applying broadly. Accepting Parent_C would preclude matching with higher priority Parents (A or B).

Since Parent_C is a viable, high-ranking candidate (P3), and the risk of losing them while continuing to wait for P1 or P2 increases with each round, securing this match now is the strategically sound move to guarantee filling the quota with a high-priority parent."
