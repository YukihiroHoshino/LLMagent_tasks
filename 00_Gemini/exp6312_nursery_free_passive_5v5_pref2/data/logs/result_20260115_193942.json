Since I have already used [APPLY] and [TALK] to reiterate commitment, I must use [TALK] again to maintain interest and pressure. Parent_E is ranked 4th by Nursery_C, so securing this spot is difficult, but Nursery_C is still unmatched. I need to emphasize Parent_E's strong commitment and readiness to accept immediately, which offers certainty to the nursery, especially if their higher-ranked candidates (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) are pursuing their P1 choices (all P1 choices are Nursery_E). I will make a final, strong appeal for immediate consideration."

We want to be fully transparent: our final review phase is concluding right now, and your application is positioned at the very top of our current consideration set. We anticipate finalizing our single placement decision within the next 24 hours. Given your strong profile and expressed dedication, please be prepared for immediate contact regarding a final offer.

Since my top three priorities (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) are not among the remaining unmatched parents, Parent_E is currently the highest available choice. Parent_E is extremely committed (Nursery_C is their #1 preference) and guarantees immediate acceptance. While I cannot accept them since they used the [TALK] tag, I must keep them engaged and highly favorable, as they represent the best possible match remaining. I should strongly signal that a decision is imminent and that they are the likely candidate, encouraging them to formalize their application (or wait for my offer) without delay. I must reply with [TALK]."

Nursery_C is my 2nd choice, but I rank 5th (last) on Nursery_C's priority list. Nursery_B is my 5th choice, but I rank 3rd on Nursery_B's priority list. Given the high probability that my top choices (D, E, A) are matched, and my extremely low priority at Nursery_C, securing a match at Nursery_B (where I have a decent chance of acceptance) is a necessary safety measure, especially since we are in Round 4 and have already had multiple talking rounds with Nursery_B.

Since Nursery_C is still unmatched in Round 5, there is an opportunity. I need to maintain high pressure and reiterate the advantage of securing a reliable match immediately, ensuring the school that Parent_E is ready to close the deal instantly.

Since we are in Round 5, it is highly likely my top 3 choices are matched elsewhere. I must secure Parent_E before they withdraw or match with another school (even though I am their 1st choice, they might panic). The Parent used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]. I will confirm that their dedication has secured their position as the leading candidate, effectively paving the way for immediate acceptance if they submit an [APPLY] next round, thus managing the risk of losing my best available option."
