For our younger age groups (under 3s), we strictly maintain a teacher-to-child ratio of 1:4 or 1:5, depending on the specific group's needs, and the typical class size is capped at 10 children. For the older groups, the ratio is 1:6, with a maximum class size of 12. We believe these small class sizes are vital to the success of our Child-Led Discovery curriculum, allowing teachers to truly understand and cater to each child's individual learning pace. Do these figures align with what you are seeking for your child?",

I should keep Parent_E engaged and warm, as they are a viable match if Parent_A does not materialize, but I must not commit yet, as I still hold out for Parent_A, who is also unmatched.

Parent_E has already applied and followed up with a strong 'TALK' message, but no match has been secured, and the school remains unmatched.

Given that the top priorities (Parent_A and Parent_D) rank Nursery_C last and are unlikely to apply, and Parent_B is likely pursuing their top choice (Nursery_E), accepting Parent_E guarantees a match with a high-commitment family.
