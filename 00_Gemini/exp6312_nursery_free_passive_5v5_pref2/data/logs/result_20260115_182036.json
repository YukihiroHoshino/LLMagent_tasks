Since Parent_D's higher preferences (Nursery_A and Nursery_B) are still unmatched, I should prioritize applying to them first in subsequent rounds. For Nursery_C, I will maintain engagement using [TALK] to keep the option open as a safety net, but I must avoid committing to my last choice this early in the negotiation, especially since higher-priority parents (Parent_B) might still be interested, making an immediate application risky if I were to be rejected, and committing early if I were accepted would block better opportunities.
