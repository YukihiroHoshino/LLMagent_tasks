Parent_B is highly desirable, listing Nursery_C as their second preference. Accepting Parent_E now would mean settling for a low priority match and foregoing the chance to secure Parent_B or Parent_A.

Nursery_C previously rejected Parent_E twice, citing higher-ranked candidates. Parent_E is now initiating a [TALK].

This means that if Parent_E wants to match, this is the only viable option left. Although Parent_E is 4th on Nursery_C's priority list, it is highly likely that Nursery_C's higher priorities (Parent_B, Parent_A, Parent_D) have already matched with the other four nurseries (A, B, D, E) which are now closed. If so, Parent_E is effectively the highest priority applicant remaining for Nursery_C. I have applied twice before unsuccessfully, but given the critical state of the market (Round 7, last open spot), I must apply again and stress immediate commitment to secure the match."

I have previously rejected Parent_E twice, but in the last round, I signaled readiness to accept due to the process 'rapidly concluding' and Parent_E's high commitment (Nursery_C is their unequivocal first choice). Since I still have not secured my top 3 priorities (P_B, P_A, P_D), and P_A and P_D rank me last, the risk of holding out further is high, especially in Round 7.
