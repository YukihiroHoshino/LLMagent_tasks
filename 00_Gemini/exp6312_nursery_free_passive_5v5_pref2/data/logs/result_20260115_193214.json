Furthermore, Parent_D's 2nd choice, Nursery_A, offers a much better prospect (Parent_D is 2nd priority there) and is still available. Since I am paired with B now, the best strategy is to use [TALK]. This allows Parent_D to express deep interest and appeal actively (as B is high on the list) without forcing a rejection due to the priority ranking, thereby keeping the option open while Parent_D potentially pursues the better prospect (Nursery_A) in a subsequent round."
