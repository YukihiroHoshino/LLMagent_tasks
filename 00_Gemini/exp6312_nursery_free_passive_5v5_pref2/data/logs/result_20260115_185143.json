It is Round 8, and Nursery_C still has its full quota (1). While Nursery_C prefers Parent_B (P1), Parent_A (P2), and Parent_D (P3), none of them have applied yet, and holding out further significantly increases the risk of being left unmatched, or only matching with Parent_C (P5). Given Parent_E's high commitment and guaranteed acceptance, securing this match now is the optimal strategy to maximize utility (ranking 4th is better than 5th or 0) given the uncertainty of the higher-ranked parents committing. Therefore, I will accept Parent_E."
