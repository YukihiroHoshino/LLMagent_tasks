The available parents are Parent_C, Parent_D, and Parent_E. Parent_A (my #1 choice) appears to be matched elsewhere, as they are not on the list of unmatched parents. Parent_C is my #2 priority and the highest ranked available parent. Parent_C has applied and stated that Nursery_D is their absolute first choice. Given that Parent_C is a highly desirable match, I should accept immediately to secure my quota with the best available option."
