I have previously sent an official application ([APPLY]) to Nursery_D, but since Nursery_D is still unmatched, I must assume that application was either rejected or is pending and needs to be reaffirmed, especially since I am ranked last (5th) on Nursery_D's priority list. To maximize my chance of securing this strong preference, I must re-submit my application and demonstrate unwavering commitment. Securing my 3rd choice is crucial before moving to lower preferences like Nursery_B."

The list of remaining unmatched parents includes Parent_C (ranked 2nd), who is highly desirable.

Our transition process is highly individualized, beginning with a 'settling-in' period. We schedule several short preparatory visits with the parent present, gradually increasing the child's time alone. Each child is assigned a key worker who serves as the primary emotional anchor and communication bridge during this phase, ensuring consistency and security. Regarding daily updates, we utilize a dedicated nursery app for real-time communication. This includes daily digital diaries detailing meals, sleep, activities, and photos. We also prioritize face-to-face communication during drop-off and pick-up times for quick verbal updates. We aim for complete transparency and partnership throughout your child's journey with us. Based on our extensive discussions, do you feel our approach aligns well with your family's needs?",

N_B (Rank 4) lists me as their 2nd priority (P2). This is a highly favorable position.
