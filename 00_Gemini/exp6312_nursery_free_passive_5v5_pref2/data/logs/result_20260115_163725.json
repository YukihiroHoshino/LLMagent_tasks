Since I have one remaining quota, securing a high-priority match (P2) immediately is a strong strategic move, even though Parent_A (P1) is still available. Given Parent_A has higher preferences for other nurseries (E and B), waiting might result in losing both Parent_A and Parent_C. I will accept Parent_C to secure this excellent match."

Crucially, Parent_A is ranked as the absolute highest priority (1st) on Nursery_B's list. Given this extremely favorable position, the optimal strategy is to apply immediately to lock in this high-ranking match. This secures a strong outcome (Rank 2) early in the process, minimizing the risk that Nursery_B matches with Parent_B (its second priority) or that Parent_A is forced down their preference list later."

However, the current situation indicates that Nursery_C is the only nursery left unmatched, implying that my higher ranked options (E, A, B, D) are likely already filled by other parents.
