We are currently focused on completing the evaluation process with candidates prioritized higher in our admissions pool. We will not be revisiting previous decisions at this precise moment.

Parent_D previously applied and was rejected in the last round. They are now following up with a [TALK] message, reiterating commitment. My strategy is to keep Parent_D at bay while prioritizing communication with Parent_E, my best remaining option.
