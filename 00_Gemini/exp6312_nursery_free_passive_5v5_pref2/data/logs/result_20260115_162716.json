Since direct applications ([APPLY]) have not resulted in a match, and I cannot apply again based on the strict interpretation of the rule ('only if you haven't applied yet'), the best strategy is to reinforce commitment and appeal emotionally using [TALK]. I need to demonstrate that we view Nursery_C as a superior choice and are ready to commit instantly, hoping that the higher-priority parents (A, B, D, E) are currently matched elsewhere or waiting for their own top choices (Nursery_E, Nursery_D, Nursery_C itself) and thus keeping N_C open to its lower-ranked applicants."

Since Parent_C is demonstrating extreme commitment (claiming to have declined other offers) and is applying pressure, I must now pivot from rejection to acceptance to secure the match.
