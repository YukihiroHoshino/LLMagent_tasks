The only other remaining parent is Parent_E, who is my highest priority (Rank 1). Although Parent_D has shown extreme dedication and states this is their 'final time' applying, accepting them (Rank 4) would eliminate the possibility of matching with Parent_E (Rank 1). Since Parent_E is still in the pool and has previously initiated contact, I must continue to hold out for my top-ranked option. Therefore, I must reject Parent_D, despite their persistence and potential withdrawal."

However, Parent_E is ranked last (5th) by Nursery_A. I have already formally applied ([APPLY]) and followed up ([TALK]). Since Nursery_A is still unmatched, it implies the higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) either matched elsewhere or are waiting.

I have aggressively pursued N_C (Rank 1) and N_A (Rank 2) without success, suggesting they are likely holding out for parents ranked higher than me on their priority lists. If I continue to wait for N_A, I risk N_A matching with someone else (like P_B or P_D), and simultaneously risk P_B (who ranks N_E first and is N_E's Rank 2 priority) applying to N_E and potentially securing that spot if N_E grows impatient waiting for my formal application. Since securing a match is paramount, and N_E offers a guaranteed spot due to my top priority status, it is strategically sound to secure this placement now, even if it is my lowest preference. I will submit a formal application."
