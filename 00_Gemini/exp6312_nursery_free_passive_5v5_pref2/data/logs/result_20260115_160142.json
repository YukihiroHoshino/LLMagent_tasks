Although I am highly interested, Nursery_C ranks me last (5th). Since this is Round 1 and Nursery_C is a highly desirable option for me, I must signal strong intent and formally apply.

Parent_B also ranks Nursery_E as their 1st choice. This is a very strong mutual match. Although Parent_E is my top priority, they rank me last (5th), making a successful match with them highly unlikely unless they are rejected by four other schools. Securing a match with my 2nd highest priority applicant, who is eager to join, in Round 1 is strategically sound and maximizes my utility given the constraints. I will accept Parent_B."

Since Parent_D has applied in Round 1, accepting this high-ranking parent immediately secures a very favorable outcome and fulfills my quota.

I must consider Nursery_D's priority list, where I am ranked 4th ('Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_B'). This means my chances are low if higher-priority parents apply. Crucially, Parent_C ranks Nursery_D as their #1 choice. However, since I am paired with Nursery_D in Round 1, I should seize the opportunity. If I wait, a higher-priority parent might match with Nursery_D in a subsequent round. Given that this is a decent choice and I need to be proactive, I will formally apply now, hoping that the higher-priority parents were paired elsewhere or applied to their own top choices."
