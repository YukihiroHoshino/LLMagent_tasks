Nursery_C and Nursery_D are matched, meaning Nursery_A is my highest remaining preference, and Nursery_B is my second highest remaining preference (4th overall). I have failed six times to secure a match with Nursery_A. The market is contracting (only A, B, E remain). Since Nursery_B is still a desirable option on my list, and I am ranked 4th by N_B, I must apply now to secure a match before potentially being left only with my last choice (Nursery_E). I have not applied to Nursery_B previously, so I will submit a formal application."

We appreciate your interest in our program and the kind words regarding our approach to holistic development. However, due to the highly competitive nature of our single placement and the complexity of our ongoing structured review process, we are not in a position to finalize our decision at this precise moment.

The current applicant is Parent_E (Rank 4). I previously rejected Parent_D (Rank 5) to hold out for higher-ranked parents (C or E). Since Parent_C is strictly preferred over Parent_E, accepting Parent_E now would eliminate the chance of matching with my 3rd choice. Given that we are only in Round 7 and I have had positive interactions with Parent_C, I will reject Parent_E to keep the position open for Parent_C. The rejection will be polite and non-committal, similar to the one given to Parent_D, maintaining Parent_E's interest should Parent_C match elsewhere."
