My 3rd preference, Nursery_E, is still available, and I have already applied there, but Parent_C is ranked last (5th) on Nursery_E's priority list, making acceptance unlikely. Nursery_B ranks Parent_C 3rd, which offers a much better chance of securing a match. Since it is Round 4 and only B and E remain, securing a match is crucial. Applying to B now acts as a necessary compromise and a defensive hedge against likely rejection from E, preventing Parent_C from ending up unmatched. I will formally apply."

Parent_A and Parent_B must be matched elsewhere, making Parent_C the highest available priority (Rank 3) and Parent_E the next highest (Rank 4). Since Parent_C is high on my list and has formally applied, securing this match now is optimal, ensuring I meet my goal of matching with the highest possible priority available."

We have thoroughly reviewed all available options and your program stands out to us, particularly regarding your focus on child-led development and community integration.

Since Nursery_C, A, and D are likely matched and full, I am left with my 4th choice (Nursery_B) and 5th choice (Nursery_E). I have previously pursued Nursery_B (4th choice), which is still open, suggesting I might not be their top currently available candidate, or the process is delayed. Nursery_E is my last choice, but critically, Nursery_E ranks me as their absolute highest priority (Parent_E is #1 on N_E's list). Given that options are nearly exhausted in Round 4, securing a guaranteed match is paramount. I will apply to Nursery_E to lock in the match, preventing the risk of remaining unmatched entirely."
