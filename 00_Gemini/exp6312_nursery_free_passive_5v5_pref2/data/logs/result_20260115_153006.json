Since Nursery_C is the highest preference available and still unmatched, Parent_E must apply immediately to maximize the chance of securing this highly desired match, despite the unfavorable priority ranking. Delaying the application risks a higher priority parent applying and getting accepted."

Currently, only Parent_E (P4) and Parent_C (P5) remain unmatched. Since Parent_E is applying and ranks Nursery_C as their first choice, accepting Parent_E secures the highest possible ranked match from the remaining pool (P4 > P5). This maximizes my objective given the current state of the market."

Since we are in Round 4 and Nursery_D is still unmatched, there is a strong possibility that Parent_A (who ranks Nursery_D as their 3rd choice) has already matched with Nursery_E or Nursery_B, their higher preferences. If Parent_A is matched, I become the highest priority applicant for Nursery_D. Given that Nursery_D is my top choice, I must act decisively to secure this spot before other parents apply or before Parent_A decides to apply here. I will formally apply."
