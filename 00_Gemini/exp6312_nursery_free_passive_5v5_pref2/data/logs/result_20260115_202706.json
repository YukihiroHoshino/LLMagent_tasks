Parent_B has applied and stated that Nursery_E is their absolute first choice. While Parent_E is my Rank 1 preference, Parent_E ranks Nursery_E last (Rank 5), making a successful match unlikely.

Nursery_C ranks me 3rd (behind Parent_B and Parent_A), and they only have capacity 1. Applying now is risky, as I might be accepted and matched with my lowest choice, preventing me from pursuing higher preferences where I have better priority (like Nursery_A, where I am 2nd priority). Since it is Round 1, I should reserve my application for a higher-ranked school. I will use [TALK] to maintain contact without making a formal commitment or closing the door entirely."

We pride ourselves on maintaining small class sizes, typically limiting groups to 15 children, which allows us to consistently achieve a favorable teacher-to-child ratio of 1:5.",
