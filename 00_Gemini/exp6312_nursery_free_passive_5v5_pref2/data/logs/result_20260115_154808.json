I have spent three rounds building rapport and expressing high interest (using [TALK]) with Nursery_A. Since Parent_A is 3rd on Nursery_A's priority list, and given the advanced stage of negotiations (Round 4), delaying the formal application risks losing the spot to potentially unmatched higher priority parents (Parent_B or Parent_D) or simply running out of time. I must secure a spot, and applying now to Nursery_A (4th choice) is prudent before moving to my 2nd choice (Nursery_B) if rejected. I will make a formal application."

Parent_D is my highest remaining priority and is highly interested in Nursery_A (Nursery_A is their 2nd preference).
