I am Nursery_C's lowest priority (5th), but now I am almost certainly their highest *available* priority. I have applied previously and have been consistently confirming my commitment using [TALK].

We are prepared to formally extend the offer immediately.

I must respond with [TALK] but use the strongest possible language to emphasize that acceptance is guaranteed and demand the [APPLY] action in the very next round to conclude the entire allocation process successfully."
