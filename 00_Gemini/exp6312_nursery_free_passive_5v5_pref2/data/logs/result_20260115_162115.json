However, checking Nursery_D's priority list reveals that I am ranked 5th out of 5 parents, meaning four other parents (A, C, D, E) are preferred over me. Given that this is Round 1 and the market is full, applying immediately ([APPLY]) is highly likely to result in an immediate [REJECT] as Nursery_D would prefer to wait for higher-ranked applicants. I have much stronger prospects at my 1st choice (Nursery_E, where I am 2nd priority) and 2nd choice (Nursery_C, where I am 1st priority). Therefore, it is strategically unsound to waste an application opportunity on a school where I am lowest priority.
