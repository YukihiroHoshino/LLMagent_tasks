My top choice, Nursery_D, is also unmatched, and I have a much stronger priority position there (2nd). Given the severe disadvantage at Nursery_C, applying directly ([APPLY]) now is highly risky if higher-priority parents (A, B, D) are still available, and a rejection might signal weakness. Since I already initiated contact with a general TALK, I will escalate my appeal to show deep commitment and fit, preparing for an application, but I will save the formal [APPLY] tag for Nursery_D first, or if I detect Nursery_C is running out of higher-priority applicants.
