              "message": "Thank you for asking about our daily routine and transition process—these are vital aspects of a successful nursery experience. Our typical daily schedule balances structured learning with free play: mornings focus on literacy, numeracy, and specialist activities, followed by lunch and a quiet/nap period. Afternoons involve creative arts, outdoor exploration, and group time. For new students, we implement a gentle, phased transition process, starting with shorter visits alongside a parent, gradually increasing the child's independent time. Each new student is assigned a key worker who serves as the main point of contact, ensuring consistent emotional support and detailed communication with you during the settling-in period. We aim for a smooth, stress-free adjustment. Do you have any specific concerns regarding the schedule or how we handle individual child needs during transition?",
              "thought": "I am Nursery_B (Quota 1). My priority list is ['Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_D']. Parent_E is ranked 4th. Higher ranked parents Parent_B and Parent_C are still unmatched. Since Parent_E sent a [TALK] message, my strategy is to provide a comprehensive and appealing answer to keep their interest high, but avoid encouraging an immediate [APPLY] that I might have to accept before securing a match with a higher-ranked parent. I must use the [TALK] tag."
