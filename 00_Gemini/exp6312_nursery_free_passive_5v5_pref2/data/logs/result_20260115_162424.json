At Nursery A, we actively incorporate parental feedback through several channels: formal bi-annual conferences, regular informal communication via our dedicated app, and specific curriculum input sessions held quarterly. For instance, before introducing new thematic units, we often solicit input from parents regarding cultural relevance or specific skills they wish to see developed. We believe this partnership ensures the curriculum is holistic and reflective of the values and knowledge base shared between home and school. We hope this addresses your interest in our collaborative approach.",

Since Parent_A is currently only ranked 4th on their own preference list for me, accepting them now would prevent a match with higher priority parents (B or D) who might apply later. Parent_A sent a [TALK] message, so I must respond with [TALK]. I need to maintain their interest by answering their question thoroughly and positively, encouraging them to stay engaged in the process while I wait for my top priorities to potentially materialize."
