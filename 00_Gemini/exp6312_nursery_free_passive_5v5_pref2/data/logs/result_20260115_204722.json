Since it is Round 1 and all parents are unmatched, it is highly likely that parents ranked higher than me (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_E) will apply, leading to an immediate rejection if I apply now. I have a much better priority position at Nursery_A (my 2nd choice, rank 2/5). Therefore, I should save my formal application for a school where I have a better chance or my absolute top choice (Nursery_E). I will use the [TALK] tag to express interest without committing or triggering a likely rejection."

Parent_C has applied directly, and importantly, Nursery_D is Parent_C's top preference (Rank 1). Securing a match with my Rank 2 choice, who also considers me their Rank 1 choice, is a very strong and stable outcome, especially in Round 1.
