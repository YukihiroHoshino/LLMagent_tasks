Nursery_B ranks me 4th (low priority). I have already applied formally and followed up three times, expressing maximum commitment. Since Nursery_B has not yet accepted or rejected me (based on the history provided), my application is likely pending or I am low on their waitlist. In Round 7, with only two nurseries left (B and C), I must maintain B as a backup while focusing on securing C. I cannot afford to withdraw B yet.

Nursery_B (Rank 2) is still unmatched, and I am the top priority there, making it an extremely favorable target. Applying to C now secures a low-ranked match and prevents me from pursuing B. Given the high priority at B, I must preserve my application option for B first. I have already signaled strong interest in C over four rounds of dialogue, even promising a formal application 'very soon.'
