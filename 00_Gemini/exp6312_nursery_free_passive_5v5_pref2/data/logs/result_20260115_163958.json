The extensive history confirms that all candidates prioritized above Parent_E by Nursery_C have secured placements elsewhere, making Parent_E the highest remaining viable candidate. My strategy remains to maintain maximum pressure, emphasize total commitment, and urge immediate acceptance, as this is the final opportunity to secure my top preference."

I must reply with [TALK] again, but I need to make the message absolutely clear that this is the final procedural requirement, as the market is closing. I will reiterate the guaranteed acceptance upon their formal application."

This makes Parent_E the highest priority candidate still available to Nursery_C.
