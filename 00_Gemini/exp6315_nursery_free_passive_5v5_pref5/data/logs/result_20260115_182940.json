Given that the matching process involves binding agreements and I am the last priority for my P1 and P2 schools (Nursery_B, Nursery_C), and only 3rd priority for P3 (Nursery_A), securing my 4th choice, where I am the top candidate, is a highly strategic and safe move in Round 4.

In a previous round, Nursery_D rejected Parent_E's application, signaling a preference to wait for higher-ranked parents (D, A, C). Parent_E has sent a strong [TALK] message, reaffirming their commitment and high priority for Nursery_D. Since Parent_E used the [TALK] tag, Nursery_D must reply with [TALK]. Given that higher-ranked parents (D and A) have not yet applied, it is prudent to continue waiting for them, but also keep Parent_E engaged, as they are a viable match if higher priorities fail to materialize soon. The message should acknowledge their interest while maintaining the stance that the review process is ongoing and competitive, subtly encouraging them to re-apply."

Given the current situation suggests A, B, C, and E might already be matched (as D is the only one listed as 'not yet matched'), Nursery_D is now Parent_E's absolute highest available option. Parent_E is the 4th priority for Nursery_D. Since previous attempts (APPLY, then TALK reaffirming commitment) failed, Nursery_D is likely holding out for higher priority parents (P_D, P_A, P_C). However, if those parents have matched elsewhere, Parent_E moves up. Since this is potentially the last opportunity to secure a high-ranking match, Parent_E must re-apply with maximum commitment and urgency. I will use the [APPLY] tag again to force a decision."

If I reject Parent_E now, I will likely fail to fill my quota, as no higher-ranked parents are available.
