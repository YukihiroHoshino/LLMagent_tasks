My top choice, Nursery_A, is available, but I applied there previously and must assume I was rejected or deferred, given the need to move down my list in Round 4. Nursery_E is the last available safety option. Parent_B is 3rd on Nursery_E's priority list, which is a good position if the top two preferred parents (A and C) have matched elsewhere (likely, given B, C, D are gone). Since remaining unmatched is worse than matching with Nursery_E, and the market is closing, I must secure this spot now."
