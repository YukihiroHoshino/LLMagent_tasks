This typically begins with shorter, supervised visits where the parent remains present, followed by brief, planned separations that gradually increase in duration over the first week or two. Our lead teachers are highly skilled in supporting children through emotional changes, prioritizing comfort, security, and building trust immediately. We are flexible and adjust the pace based on the individual child's temperament and needs.\n\n**Parent Communication during Transition:** Communication is paramount during this time. Before the start date, we conduct an individualized intake meeting to gather detailed information about your child’s routines and preferences. Once school begins, parents receive daily digital journals detailing activities, meals, and mood. Crucially, we maintain open lines of communication with the lead teacher via a dedicated app for immediate check-ins, and we schedule a formal 'Transition Review Meeting' at the end of the second week to discuss progress and address any emerging concerns. Our goal is to ensure you feel fully informed and supported throughout this initial phase.\n\nWe genuinely believe this careful, supportive transition process ensures a successful start, and we remain incredibly excited about the possibility of welcoming your family.

As we finalize our decision, we are now focused on health and safety protocols, which are paramount. Could you briefly elaborate on your specific policies regarding illness management, including exclusion policies for common childhood ailments, and how you manage medication administration if required during school hours?",
              "thought": "I am Parent_E. My highest remaining preference is Nursery_D (Rank 2), which is still unmatched. My current target for this round is Nursery_B (Rank 5), my lowest preference, but where I hold the highest priority (Rank 1). Since Nursery_D is still available, I should continue to stall with Nursery_B to keep the option open for matching with Nursery_D in a subsequent round. Given the advanced stage of the market (Round 15), I need to ensure I secure a spot soon, but delaying the guaranteed match at B (Rank 5) by one more round is acceptable to maximize the chance of securing D (Rank 2). I will use [TALK] to ask a final, logistical question, maintaining high interest without committing to an application."

These aspects are paramount to us, and we are happy to elaborate on our policies, which are designed to protect all children and staff.\n\n**Illness Management and Exclusion Policy:** We adhere strictly to public health guidelines. Our primary policy is centered on prevention and rapid isolation. Children exhibiting symptoms of common childhood ailments (e.g., fever of 100.4°F or higher, vomiting, diarrhea, infectious rashes) must be excluded immediately and remain home until they are symptom-free for a full 24 hours without medication. We provide parents with a clear, detailed health policy handbook upon enrollment, ensuring full transparency regarding exclusion criteria for various conditions.\n\n**Medication Administration:** If a child requires prescription medication during school hours, our policy is highly regulated. Only designated, trained staff members are authorized to administer medication. Parents must provide the medication in its original container, along with a completed 'Medication Administration Authorization Form' signed by both the parent and the prescribing physician, detailing dosage and timing. We log every administration meticulously, and parents are informed immediately upon administration. We ensure this process is handled with the utmost care, precision, and respect for the child's needs.",

The current question concerns critical health and safety protocols (illness management and medication), so the response must be detailed and reassuring to finalize their decision-making process. I must continue to appeal actively."

The market is highly constrained, with only two schools (Nursery_B and Nursery_D) remaining unmatched. I have failed to match with Ranks 2, 3, and 4, and I have been actively pursuing Rank 1 (Nursery_B). Since I have a guaranteed match with Nursery_D (P1 for them), and matching with D is preferred over being unmatched, it is strategically sound to secure this spot now, especially after 7 rounds of 'TALK' where I kept my options open.
