Our philosophy is rooted in recognizing that children learn best through a balance. Typically, the morning (8:30 AM to 11:30 AM) is dedicated to structured learning—small group work focused on our core literacy, numeracy, and thematic units. However, even within this structure, we incorporate hands-on, active learning methods rather than passive seating. After lunch, the afternoon is primarily dedicated to unstructured, child-led free play and exploration, often outdoors. We dedicate significant time (at least 90 minutes) to this free play because it is crucial for developing critical thinking, social negotiation skills, and creativity. This dynamic balance ensures children meet key developmental milestones while also fostering essential independence and joy. We are eager to welcome your child into this environment.",
