Our goal is to finalize our allocation as efficiently as possible. We are currently in the final review phase, and we anticipate issuing acceptance notifications within the next 48 hours for families who have submitted an application. To be perfectly clear, we hold your family in the absolute highest regard, and we would be honored to secure a place for your child.

Although Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last (Rank 5), the extensive conversation history has been positive, and Parent_D is now asking about the acceptance timeline, indicating they are nearing a decision point. I must capitalize on this momentum to encourage an application. Since Parent_D used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. I will answer the question about the timeline while strongly appealing to them and emphasizing their high priority status to encourage an immediate application."

Everything we have learned confirms that your environment would be an excellent fit for our child's development.

However, the current situation indicates that only Nursery_D remains unmatched (Nurseries A, B, C, and E are matched). Therefore, Nursery_D is my last remaining opportunity to secure an allocation. Since matching with my 5th choice is better than remaining unmatched, I must apply immediately. Crucially, I am Nursery_D's top priority ('Parent_D' is Rank 1 on Nursery_D's list), guaranteeing acceptance."
