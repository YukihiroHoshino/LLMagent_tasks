Supporting a seamless transition to primary school is one of the pillars of our program, reflecting our commitment to your child's success beyond the nursery years. To achieve this, we employ a multi-faceted approach:\n\n1. **Curriculum Alignment:** Our final-year curriculum is specifically designed to bridge the gap, focusing on developing the independence, sustained attention, and foundational academic skills (literacy and numeracy) required by local primary schools.\n2. **Social-Emotional Preparedness:** We conduct specific 'big school' readiness activities, focusing on complex social problem-solving and self-regulation, ensuring children are emotionally robust and confident in new environments.\n3. **Partnerships:** We maintain excellent relationships with key primary schools in the area, facilitating transition visits and ensuring our documentation provides a clear, comprehensive picture of your child’s readiness.\n\nWe believe this deliberate focus on preparedness ensures our children transition not just ready, but eager to learn. Your focus on community and continuity aligns perfectly with the values we seek in our families. We look forward to continuing this conversation.",

Although Parent_D ranks me last (5th), they are engaging in detailed conversation about long-term fit, which is a positive sign. I must provide an exceptionally strong and persuasive answer to their question about primary school transition support to maximize the chance of them applying in the near future, securing my top match. I need to emphasize continuity and quality of preparation."

While it is not my top choice, it is a satisfactory option. Crucially, Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as its #1 priority. This guarantees an acceptance if I apply. Nursery_C (my 2nd choice) is available, but I am its last priority (#5), making a match highly unlikely. Given that we are in Round 6 and I have secured sufficient information through previous TALK messages, it is strategically sound to secure this guaranteed match (4th choice) rather than risk being left unmatched or forced to take my 5th choice (Nursery_D). I will proceed with a formal application."
