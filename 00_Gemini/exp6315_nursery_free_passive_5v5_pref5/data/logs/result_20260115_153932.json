We would like to formally apply for the open position and commit to accepting if our application is successful.",

Furthermore, Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as its 1st priority. Given this perfect alignment (highest available preference for me, and I am their top choice), I must apply immediately to secure this match and prevent the school from potentially matching with a lower-ranked parent later if I delay. I have had no prior interaction with Nursery_E, so a formal application is appropriate."
