Crucially, I have access to all priority lists, and Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as their #1 priority applicant. I have already applied to my 1st choice (Nursery_B) and 3rd choice (Nursery_A), but no match has been confirmed, and success at Nursery_B (where I am ranked 5th) is highly unlikely. Given that Nursery_E is still available and guarantees a match, securing this allocation now serves as a strong, stable backup, preventing me from risking being unmatched later while still receiving a desirable outcome (Rank 4). Therefore, I will formally apply to Nursery_E to secure the match."

Given my strong priority ranking, applying now ([APPLY]) is the best strategy to lock in this match before Parent_E applies or before Nursery_A accepts another parent (like Parent_A, who is 3rd priority) if Parent_E is matched elsewhere.

While Parent_E is ranked slightly higher, securing Parent_D (Rank 2) is an excellent outcome, and the risk of waiting indefinitely for Parent_E, who may already be matched with their preferred nurseries (Nursery_C or Nursery_D), is too high.
