Nursery_D is my 5th and lowest preference, but it is better than remaining unmatched. Only Nursery_D and Nursery_E remain available. Crucially, Nursery_D ranks Parent_D as its highest priority (P1). Given that the market is almost cleared and I want to secure a spot, applying to Nursery_D is the optimal safe strategy. Although I previously applied to Nursery_E (my 4th choice), since I am still making a move, that match is not yet secured or failed. I will move immediately to secure the guaranteed match with Nursery_D."
