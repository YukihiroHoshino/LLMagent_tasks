We are deeply impressed by your family's commitment and enthusiasm for our specific curriculum and approach to holistic development, and we genuinely appreciate you confirming us as your highest priority. After careful review of your application, and recognizing the excellent fit between our institutions and your family values, we are delighted to offer you a place at Nursery C. We look forward to welcoming you to our community.",
              "thought": "I am Nursery_C, seeking to fill my single quota with the highest priority parent. My priority list is ['Parent_B', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A']. Parent_C is my second highest priority (P2). Parent_B (P1) has only engaged in talking and has not applied. Parent_C has applied and stated I am their highest priority. Since securing P2 is an excellent outcome and fulfills my quota immediately, I should accept this application. This prevents losing Parent_C while waiting indefinitely for Parent_B."
