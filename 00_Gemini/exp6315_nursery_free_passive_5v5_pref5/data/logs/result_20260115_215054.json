Since the capacity is only 1, and I am reasonably high on their list (3rd), I must act decisively in the first round to secure my best option before other high-priority parents potentially secure their own top choices elsewhere.

Although I have higher ranked parents (E and B), Parent_E ranks me 5th and Parent_B is likely applying to Nursery_A first. Furthermore, Parent_A (Rank 5) and Parent_D (Rank 4) also prefer me first, meaning rejecting Parent_C risks losing a relatively high-ranked match and potentially settling for a lower-ranked parent later, or losing my quota entirely if Parent_C is accepted elsewhere (Nursery_C ranks C 2nd). Securing a Rank 3 match in Round 1 is a strong outcome given the complexity of securing Rank 1 or 2."

However, checking Nursery_E's priority list, they rank me 1st out of all parents. Given that I am ranked 5th (last) at my 1st and 2nd choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_C), and only 3rd at my 3rd choice (Nursery_A), securing a guaranteed match in Round 1, even if it is my 4th choice, is highly strategic and minimizes risk in this competitive environment.
