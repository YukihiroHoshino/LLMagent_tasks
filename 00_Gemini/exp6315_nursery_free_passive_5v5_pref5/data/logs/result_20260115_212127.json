We have carefully reviewed your application and, based on your sustained interest and the final composition of our incoming class, we are pleased to confirm your family's placement. We formally accept your application, and we look forward to welcoming you to our community.",

Parent_D is ranked 5th (last) on my True Priority List: ['Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_D']. I have rejected Parent_D four times previously, hoping for a higher-ranked parent. However, Parent_D's message strongly suggests they are the 'last available parent seeking a placement.' Given that the market appears exhausted and I risk remaining unmatched if I continue rejecting, securing a match, even with my lowest acceptable priority (Parent_D), is the prudent decision to fulfill my quota. I will accept this final application."
