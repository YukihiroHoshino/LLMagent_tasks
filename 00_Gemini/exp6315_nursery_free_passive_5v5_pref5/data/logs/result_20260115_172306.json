We also pair new families with an experienced 'buddy family' to provide peer support and answer informal questions.\n\nRegarding parental involvement, we view our school as a community partnership. Opportunities are extensive, ranging from classroom volunteering (reading sessions, special projects) and cultural exchange days, to participating in parent education workshops focused on child development. Furthermore, we actively encourage involvement in our Parent Advisory Committee, which helps shape school policies and community events. This deep collaboration is fundamental to our school's success. Do these aspects of community involvement align with what you are seeking?",
