Regarding sensory play, it is a core component integrated throughout our daily schedule, not just during specific activity times. For example, during free play, we utilize dedicated sensory bins with rotating themes (e.g., natural materials, water beads, kinetic sand) that encourage tactile exploration and fine motor skill development. Furthermore, our art sessions often incorporate multi-sensory elements like scented playdough or textured paints. We believe this continuous exposure is key to holistic development.
