The market status suggests that Nurseries A, B, C, and D are currently matched or unavailable, leaving Nursery_E as the highest available option remaining on my list. Although I am ranked 5th (last) on Nursery_E's priority list, I must apply now to secure a spot, as remaining unmatched is my least preferred outcome. I previously used [TALK], so this round requires a formal application."

My priority list is ['Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_D']. Parent_D is ranked 5th, the lowest on my list. However, the current situation indicates that the list of Parents not yet matched consists only of Parent_D. Parent_B previously withdrew. If Parent_A, Parent_C, and Parent_E are already matched with other nurseries, Parent_D represents the best available option to fill my quota. Since Parent_D is on my list, accepting them is better than remaining unmatched. I will accept the application."
