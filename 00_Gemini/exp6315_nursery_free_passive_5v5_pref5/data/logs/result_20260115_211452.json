Crucially, I know that Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as its absolute top priority ('Parent_A' is first on Nursery_E's list). Since securing a match is paramount, and Nursery_E is guaranteed to accept me if I apply, this is a highly rational move to secure a spot better than my lowest preference (D) or remaining unmatched.
