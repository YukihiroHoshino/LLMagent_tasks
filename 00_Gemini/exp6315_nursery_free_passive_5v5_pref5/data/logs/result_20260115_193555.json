We are delighted to share more details about our program, as we believe transparency is key to a successful partnership.\n\nOur typical daily schedule is structured yet flexible, balancing guided learning with ample time for free exploration. Mornings focus on core development areas through circle time, thematic activities, and structured play (9:00 AM - 11:30 AM). Afternoons involve outdoor activities, rest time, and creative arts (1:00 PM - 3:30 PM).\n\nParent involvement is highly valued and integrated through several avenues: we host monthly workshops and community events, maintain an open-door policy for observation, and encourage parents to share their unique skills or cultural backgrounds during 'Parent Sharing Days.' We view our school as a community built on strong family partnerships. We hope this information is helpful!",

I will answer their questions thoroughly and enthusiastically. The Parent used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]."
