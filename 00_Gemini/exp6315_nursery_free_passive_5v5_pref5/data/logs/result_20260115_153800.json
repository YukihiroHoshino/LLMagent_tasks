In Round 1, competitors Parent_E and Parent_B are likely targeting their own top choices (Nursery_C and Nursery_A, respectively). If they are paired with their P1 choices this round, Nursery_B might be available for Parent_C. Given the high preference rank, I must apply immediately and aggressively to secure the spot if the higher-priority parents are elsewhere."

Accepting Parent_C now prevents me from matching with higher-ranked parents, Parent_E (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2), who might become available in subsequent rounds, particularly since their top choices (Nursery_C and Nursery_A respectively) rank them relatively low.

While I would prefer my top choices (D, A, C), those parents rank me very low in their preferences (D and A rank me 5th, C ranks me 3rd). Parent_E, however, ranks me 2nd and has submitted an [APPLY] in Round 1. Given the low likelihood of securing my top priorities who are highly sought after by other nurseries, accepting Parent_E ensures I fill my quota with a relatively high-ranking parent who genuinely desires a placement here (2nd preference). This minimizes the risk of ending up unmatched or only matching with Parent_B (5th priority). I will accept the application."

Since this is Round 1 and a guaranteed match (my 4th preference) is available, securing this match minimizes the risk of being unmatched or forced into my last choice (Nursery_D).
