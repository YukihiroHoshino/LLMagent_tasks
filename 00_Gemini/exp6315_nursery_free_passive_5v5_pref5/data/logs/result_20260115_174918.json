Supporting individual learning paces, especially in early literacy, is a cornerstone of our program. We utilize a diagnostic assessment approach at intake, allowing us to identify each child's current stage (pre-readers, emergent readers, etc.). Based on this, we implement differentiated instruction through flexible small groups. For early literacy, this means some children focus on intensive phonological awareness games and phonics instruction, while others engage in guided reading sessions using leveled books that match their proficiency. Every child receives a personalized 'Literacy Passport' which tracks their progress and ensures activities are challenging yet achievable, fostering confidence rather than frustration. Our educators meet weekly to adjust these individual plans. Does this approach address your concerns regarding your child's specific needs in literacy development?",
