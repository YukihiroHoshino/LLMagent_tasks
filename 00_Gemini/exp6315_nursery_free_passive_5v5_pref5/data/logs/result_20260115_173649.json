Therefore, securing Nursery_A is a priority.\n\nCrucially, Nursery_A ranks Parent_D as its 2nd highest priority (P['Parent_E', 'Parent_D', ...]). This gives Parent_D an excellent chance of acceptance, provided Parent_E does not apply or is matched elsewhere. Given the uncertainty and the high ranking D holds at A, I must apply immediately to secure this spot before Parent_E or another highly ranked parent applies and is accepted. I will use the [APPLY] tag."
