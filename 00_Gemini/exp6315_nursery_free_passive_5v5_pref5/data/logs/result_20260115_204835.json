This means that if I don't secure this spot, I risk remaining unmatched, or having to settle for Nursery_A, E, or D if they somehow become available (unlikely, as they are likely matched). My priority is to secure a match with C. I have already applied and repeatedly confirmed my commitment ([TALK] x5). Given that Nursery_C still hasn't matched, they are likely holding out for Parent_B or Parent_C (who rank higher on their list) or perhaps Parent_C is the unmatched parent. Regardless, I am Nursery_C's 3rd choice. I must use this final dialogue to emphasize that my commitment is immediate, unconditional, and that I represent a guaranteed successful allocation for them, especially since the market is concluding. I will use the [TALK] action to reaffirm the standing application and commitment."
