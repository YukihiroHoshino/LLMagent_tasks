Applying immediately ([APPLY]) is likely to result in a rejection, and securing my 4th choice this early is not optimal when my 3rd choice (Nursery_A) gives me 1st priority, suggesting I should save my application effort for higher-ranked schools or wait to see market movement.

Parent_B is applying to me in Round 1. While Parent_E is my top choice, Parent_E ranks Nursery_B last (5th), making a match highly improbable unless Parent_E is rejected everywhere else.

Parent_E is my 4th priority. Parents D (Rank 1) and A (Rank 2) remain unmatched, but both list Nursery_D as their lowest preference (5th choice), making it highly unlikely I will secure them, as they are likely to be accepted by their higher preferred nurseries (Nursery_A, Nursery_B, or Nursery_C). Parent_E, however, ranks Nursery_D as their 2nd choice and has formally applied. Since Parent_C (Rank 3) appears to be matched already, Parent_E is the highest priority parent who is actively seeking a match with Nursery_D. To secure a high-quality match and fill the quota, accepting Parent_E is the optimal pragmatic decision now, rather than risking an empty spot by waiting for unlikely matches (D or A)."
