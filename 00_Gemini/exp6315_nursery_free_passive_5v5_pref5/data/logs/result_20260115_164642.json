Regarding parent involvement, we structure it to ensure flexibility and meaningful contribution throughout the year.\n\nOur system includes several key components: 1) **Volunteer Opportunities:** Parents can sign up for classroom support, field trip chaperoning, or resource preparation via an online calendar. 2) **Formal Education:** We host quarterly parent workshops focused on developmental milestones and strategies for supporting independence at home. 3) **Partnership Meetings:** Beyond standard conferences, we utilize a personalized communication app that allows for daily photo/activity updates and scheduled 'Partnership Check-ins' twice a semester to discuss goals and progress collaboratively. 4) **Community Events:** We organize large-scale community events (e.g., Spring Fete, Family Reading Night) to build connections outside the classroom. We genuinely view involvement as a two-way street, ensuring parents feel integrated and informed every step of the way. We are very eager to welcome families like yours who share our values.",

To force Nursery_D (where P_E is 4th priority) to make a definitive decision and potentially secure the match before the other remaining parent (likely P_C) applies, I must use the [APPLY] tag again to trigger an ACCEPT/REJECT response, despite the previous application.

My communication history with Parent_D shows high mutual interest, making them the most probable and highest-value match. Accepting Parent_E (Rank 4) now would fill my only quota and prevent me from matching with Parent_D. Therefore, I must reject Parent_E again to hold out for Parent_D.
