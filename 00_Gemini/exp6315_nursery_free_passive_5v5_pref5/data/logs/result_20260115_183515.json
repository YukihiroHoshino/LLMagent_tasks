              "message": "Thank you for asking about our outdoor learning program! We place a huge emphasis on connecting with nature. Our typical weekly schedule ensures children spend significant time outdoors—usually a minimum of two hours daily. We strive for a dynamic balance: approximately 60% of this time is dedicated to child-led, free play exploration in our specialized outdoor environment, while 40% involves structured activities like nature studies, gardening, and observation aligned with our curriculum. We believe this blend fosters both independence and guided discovery. We are eager to share more details about how our unique approach benefits our students.",

Since Parent_E sent a [TALK] message, I must respond with [TALK]. My response should be informative, highly appealing, and encouraging to move Parent_E towards submitting an [APPLY] in a future round, given their low preference for us. I will provide a detailed answer to their question about outdoor activities."
