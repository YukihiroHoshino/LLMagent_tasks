Since Parent_B is available, I must reject Parent_D to hold the spot for Parent_B, who is significantly higher on my list.

If Parent_E is matched elsewhere, I secure the spot. If Parent_E applies, I will be rejected but still have options (like Nursery_D, where I previously applied).

Therefore, Parent_B is currently the highest available parent on my priority list. I have a remaining quota of 1. Rejecting Parent_B carries the risk of only being left with Parent_D (P4) or potentially no match at all if Parent_D matches elsewhere.
