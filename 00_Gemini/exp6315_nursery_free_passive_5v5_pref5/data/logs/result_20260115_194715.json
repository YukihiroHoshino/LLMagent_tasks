Since securing a high-ranked spot early is vital, and my chances here are unexpectedly strong, I will formally apply to secure my 3rd choice immediately rather than risking losing it while pursuing my top two choices (B and C) where competition might be higher from agents who rank high on those schools' priority lists and also prefer them. This is a good opportunity to lock in a desirable outcome."

In a previous round, I rejected Parent_C, likely hoping for Parent_D or Parent_A. Parent_C is reapplying, showing strong commitment, and they rank Nursery_D 3rd on their list, which is higher than my top two choices rank me (5th). Given that securing Parent_D or Parent_A is highly unstable due to their preferences for other schools (Nursery_B, Nursery_C, Nursery_A), securing Parent_C now represents a good, stable match at the 3rd position on my list. It is prudent to accept this reliable match now rather than risk losing Parent_C and failing to secure my top two choices later."
