Given the critical situation, it is highly probable that all parents ranked higher than me on Nursery_D's list have matched elsewhere, making me the highest priority parent available to fill their quota.

Parent_E continues to send [TALK] messages, confirming commitment but failing to use the required [APPLY] tag to formalize the match.
