This transition process is highly intentional and central to fostering self-regulation skills in our children.\n\nWe manage this with a predictable, multi-step routine: Approximately 10 minutes before coming inside, staff introduce a specific auditory cue (like a transition song). This signals the end of free play. Children then participate in a group cool-down activity, such as a focused observation game or deep breathing exercises, while gathering their belongings. Upon entering the building, the routine involves hand-washing, a quiet water break, and immediate transition to their mats or designated quiet areas. The initial indoor period is dedicated to individual, low-stimulus activities (like reading or puzzles) to allow their energy levels to settle naturally before moving into structured indoor lessons or rest time. This structure minimizes overstimulation and ensures a calm, focused learning environment both before and after outdoor exploration.\n\nYour focus on these nuanced aspects of child development confirms our belief that you would be an excellent fit for our community. We hope you consider applying soon.",
