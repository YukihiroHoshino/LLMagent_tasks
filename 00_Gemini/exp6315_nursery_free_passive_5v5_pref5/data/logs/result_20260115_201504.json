Since Parent_C is not my top remaining choice, I cannot accept them yet (if they applied), and since they sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK].

I have previously applied and then used [TALK] to confirm my 'unwavering commitment' and immediate acceptance. Since all other nurseries (A, B, C, E) are matched, the competition for D is limited to the remaining unmatched parents. As P_C is ranked 3rd by Nursery_D, if the top two priorities (P_D, P_A) are matched elsewhere, I become their highest remaining priority. Given the urgency and the previous strong commitment expressed via [TALK], the most effective action now is a definitive re-application ([APPLY]) to force a match or rejection, as there are no other options available for me."
