This ensures that every child receives individualized support, allowing our dedicated staff to deeply understand and cater to each student's unique learning pace and emotional needs.

I have already engaged in three rounds of 'TALK' with Nursery_D, gathering all necessary information. I need to maintain this strong relationship without committing, in case my top choices fall through.

I have previously engaged in four rounds of [TALK] with Nursery_D, building strong rapport but avoiding commitment while pursuing higher preferences (B, C, A, E).
