Since all other options are presumably matched, Nursery_D must accept me to fill its quota, assuming no higher-priority parents are still seeking a match here.

Matching with Parent_B is optimal since it is the highest available match (Rank 5 > Unfilled/Rank 6). I have been trying to push Parent_B to accept the standing offer for several rounds. Parent_B continues to use [TALK] to demand acceptance without formally applying/accepting, forcing me to remain in the [TALK] loop. I must confirm the offer is still active and secured, and reiterate that Parent_B must take the final step to formalize the match, adhering to the rule that I must reply with [TALK] to their [TALK] message."

I formally applied in Round 3, but the negotiation has stalled, with me sending aggressive [TALK] messages since then, demanding a decision based on market closure. Since this tactic failed to yield an acceptance over 8 rounds, I will formally [APPLY] again in this round. This action forces Nursery_D to respond with either [ACCEPT] or [REJECT]. Given the stable matching outcome requirement when all other agents are matched, Nursery_D has no better alternative and must accept me to fill its quota."
