Although Parent_E is ranked 4th out of 5 by Nursery_C (priority list: B, C, D, E, A), Nursery_C is still unmatched in Round 4. Given the high stakes and the fact that I previously expressed strong interest, it is critical to apply now before a higher-priority parent (B, C, or D) secures the spot. I must use the [APPLY] tag to maximize my chance of securing my P1 choice."

The current list of parents not yet matched is ['Parent_A', 'Parent_E']. This implies that the higher priority parents (B, C, D) are already matched elsewhere and are unavailable. Therefore, Parent_E is the highest available priority applicant remaining. Given that Parent_E has formally applied and previously stated Nursery_C is their top choice, and Nursery_C has an immediate quota of 1 to fill, accepting Parent_E is the optimal move to secure the highest remaining preference."

Since Nursery_C (my 2nd choice) is still unmatched, I must avoid getting locked into a match with Nursery_D prematurely, even though I rank 2nd on D's priority list. I have already initiated [TALK] with D. The safest strategic move is to maintain passive contact ([TALK]) without applying or withdrawing, keeping D as a backup while focusing my efforts (in subsequent rounds, if possible) on higher-ranked available schools like Nursery_C."

Given the strong interest and our limited capacity of just one spot, we anticipate finalizing our decision very shortly.

Parent_A has submitted a formal application ([APPLY]) and stated that Nursery_D is their definitive choice and they are ready to commit immediately. While Parent_D (P1) is technically preferred, Parent_D also ranks Nursery_D last, making a successful match highly unlikely without significant market movement. Accepting Parent_A secures a high-priority match (P2) and fulfills the quota reliably early in the process. This is a strong and justifiable decision."
