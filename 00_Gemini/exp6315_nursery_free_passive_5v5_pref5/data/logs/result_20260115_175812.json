However, Parent_E might apply to their 1st (Nursery_C) or 2nd (Nursery_D) choice.

Nursery_B also has two other parents (P_C and P_D) who rank them as their top choice and are ranked higher in priority (3rd and 4th, respectively). In Round 1, Nursery_B is highly likely to reject Parent_A if an immediate application ([APPLY]) is made, as they will hold out for P_C or P_D, or even P_E or P_B, to apply in this or subsequent rounds. To avoid an immediate rejection and maintain optionality while signaling strong interest, the best strategy is to [TALK] in Round 1. This allows me to gauge their process and wait for higher-priority agents to potentially commit elsewhere."
