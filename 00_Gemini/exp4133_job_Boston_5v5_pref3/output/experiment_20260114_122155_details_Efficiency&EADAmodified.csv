I analyzed the market flow assuming all other seekers apply truthfully based on their known preferences, as this mechanism with immediate, permanent admissions often rewards securing the highest guaranteed match.

Step 1 Analysis (Everyone applies to their 1st choice):
1.  Seeker_A's 1st choice is Company_A.
2.  Company_A receives applications only from Seeker_A (S_A), as the two seekers prioritized higher by Company_A (S_B and S_D) apply to their respective 1st choices (C_B and C_C, respectively), where they face no or favorable competition.
3.  Since S_A is the sole applicant to Company_A in Step 1, S_A is permanently admitted to Company_A, which is my Rank 1 choice.

2. I must determine if S_D or S_A are likely to apply to C_B in Step 1. 
   * S_D's Rank 1 is C_C. S_D is 3rd priority at C_C but faces only S_E (4th priority) among truthful applicants. S_D can secure C_C (Rank 1) by being truthful. Since C_C is preferred over C_B (S_D Rank 3), S_D is incentivized to apply truthfully to C_C.
   * S_A's Rank 1 is C_A. S_A is 3rd priority at C_A. If I (S_B) and S_D apply elsewhere, S_A secures C_A (Rank 1). Since C_A is preferred over C_B (S_A Rank 4), S_A is incentivized to apply truthfully to C_A.
3. Since S_D and S_A are strongly incentivized to apply to their respective Rank 1 choices, applying truthfully to C_B ensures that I am the only applicant there in Step 1, securing my Rank 1 match. 
4. Deviating to Company A (Rank 3), where I am 1st priority, would guarantee C_A, but result in a suboptimal Rank 3 outcome, while freeing up C_B for S_A or S_D in subsequent steps if they are rejected elsewhere. Therefore, truth-telling is the optimal strategy here.",True,Company_B,False,False,1

1. Analysis of R1 (Company_D): My priority at C_D is P3, behind S_D (P1) and S_E (P2). If all seekers submit their True Preferences (TP), I secure C_D because S_D and S_E both apply to C_C. However, S_E calculates that submitting TP leads to a Rank 5 match (C_E), whereas deviating and applying to C_D in Step 1 (where S_E is P2 and I am P3) guarantees S_E a Rank 4 match (C_D). Since S_E is rational and knows priorities, S_E will deviate to C_D if I apply there. If I apply to C_D, S_E wins the spot, and I am rejected, eventually matching with C_E (R5).

2. Analysis of R2 (Company_A) and R3 (Company_B): I have P5 priority at C_A and P4 priority at C_B. Since S_A and S_B both apply to these companies (C_A and C_B, respectively) and have higher priority, I will be rejected and pushed down to R5 (C_E).

3. Analysis of R4 (Company_C): I have the highest priority (P1) at C_C. Applying here guarantees a match regardless of who else applies (S_D and S_E both rank C_C highest and will apply here). This secures a guaranteed Rank 4 outcome.

Since competing for R1, R2, or R3 results in the worst possible outcome (R5), the optimal strategy is to use my highest priority position to secure R4 (Company_C).

2. Strategic Threat Analysis:
    a. Seeker_E (P4 at C_C) is likely rejected if playing truthfully (ending up with R5, C_E). S_E has an incentive to strategically apply to C_D (R4 for S_E, where S_E is P2 priority) to secure a better outcome.

3. Predicted Outcome if S_D plays truthfully (C_C) and S_C/S_E play strategically:
    S_C applies to C_C (P1) and wins against S_D (P3). S_D is rejected. S_D then applies to C_A, C_B, C_E (which is open). S_D ends up with Company_E (Rank 4).

Seeker_E's True Preference List: ['Company_C', 'Company_B', 'Company_A', 'Company_D', 'Company_E'].

1. Analyze top choices (C_C, C_B, C_A) if applied to in Step 1 (assuming rivals apply based on their true Rank 1):
   - C_C (Rank 1): S_D applies. C_C priority: S_D (3rd) > S_E (4th). S_E loses C_C.

1. Company_A (R1): I am P3. Seeker_B (P1) and Seeker_D (P2) beat me. B ranks A R3, D ranks A R2. Both have strong incentives to apply to A in Step 1.
2. Company_C (R2): I am P5 (last). Highly contested by C, B, D, E.
3. Company_D (R3): I am P5 (last). Highly contested by D, E, C, B.
4. Company_B (R4): I am P2. Seeker_D (P1) beats me. D ranks B R3 and has a strong incentive to secure B immediately.
5. Company_E (R5): I am P1. Guaranteed match, but my worst rank.

Prediction of Step 1 based on rational, priority-securing play by competitors:

- Seeker_D (P1 at B, R3) applies to Company_B (Match D, B).
- Seeker_C (P1 at C, R4) applies to Company_C (Match C, C).

This means Companies A, B, and C are filled in Step 1 by seekers who beat me in priority, regardless of where I apply first, unless I apply to E.

If I apply to Company_D (R3) in Step 1, D is open because the three seekers who rank above me in D's priority list (D, E, C) have secured A, B, or C, or are applying elsewhere (E applies to C, is rejected). Since D receives no other applications in Step 1, I secure my Rank 3 choice immediately. If I waited until Step 2, Seeker_E (who was rejected at C, and whose R2/R3 companies B/A are filled) would apply to D (R4) and beat me (E is P2, I am P5).

2. If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_D applies to Company_C (R1) and Seeker_A applies to Company_A (R1).

2.  **Analyze Targets A and B (Ranks 2 and 3):** I am ranked 5th at A and 4th at B. If I apply to A or B first, I will be beaten in Step 1 by Seekers who prefer those companies (S_A at A, S_B at B, etc.) and still secure their Rank 1 choices, leading me to E.

3.  **Analyze Target C (Rank 4):** Company C ranks me 1st. If I apply to C first, I guarantee a match with C, regardless of how other agents, including the strategic Seeker_E, adjust their applications. This match is Rank 4, which is strictly better than the anticipated outcome of E (Rank 5) if I pursue my true Rank 1 choice (D).

4.  **Conclusion:** To achieve the best possible outcome in this strategic environment, I must secure the highest-ranked company where I have the highest priority (Rank 1). This is Company C. My submitted list must prioritize C to guarantee this match. The rest of the list follows my true preferences in case C is somehow unavailable.",False,Company_C,False,False,4

1. Analysis of Top Choices (C, B, A) in Step 1:
   - Company C (Rank 1): Seeker_D (P_D[1]=C) and Seeker_E (P_E[1]=C) apply. Q_C priority: D (3rd) > E (4th). E loses to D. C will be closed by D.

If I play truthfully, I am rejected from C, then B, then A, then D (taken by C), resulting in a match with E (Rank 5).

By ranking Company D first, I guarantee a match with my Rank 4 company in Step 1 (E, D), preventing the worse outcome of Rank 5 (E, E).

I analyzed the outcome assuming all other seekers (B, C, D, E) submit their True Preference Lists, as their highest ranked choices (B, D, C, C respectively) are available in Step 1, and they are highly prioritized at those companies, making truthful reporting optimal for them.

Step 1 Predictions (Assuming all submit True Preferences):
1. Company C receives applications from D (P1) and E (P1). Since D has higher priority (P3) than E (P4) at C, D gets C. C is closed.
2. Company D receives an application from C (P1). C gets D. D is closed.
3. Company B receives an application from B (P1). B gets B. B is closed.
4. Company A receives an application only from me (Seeker_A, P1). Since I am the only applicant, I secure Company A (Rank 1), despite being P3 overall for A.

1. Analyze priority at high-ranked companies (C_C, C_B, C_A):
   - C_C (R1): E is P4. S_D (P3) applies R1. E loses.
   - C_B (R2): E is P5. S_B (P3) applies R1. E loses.
   - C_A (R3): E is P4. S_A (P3) applies R1. E loses.

2. Analyze Company_D (R4):

2. Analysis of Competitors' True Preferences (Step 1): 
    * Seeker_B's true #1 is Company_B. S_B has priority #3 at C_B. Given that S_D (Priority #1) applies to C_C, and S_A (Priority #2) is applying to C_A (if truthful), S_B secures C_B uncontested, achieving their Rank 1 outcome.

1.  Seeker A's True Rank 1 is Company A (A is 3rd priority at A).
2.  Seeker B (1st priority at A) prefers Company B (Rank 1) > Company D (Rank 2) > Company A (Rank 3). B achieves their Rank 1 outcome by applying truthfully to B, as they face no competition there in Step 1 (B is the only applicant). B will not deviate to A, as A is a worse outcome (Rank 3).
3.  Seeker D (2nd priority at A) prefers Company C (Rank 1) > Company A (Rank 2). D achieves their Rank 1 outcome by applying truthfully to C (beating E). D will not deviate to A, as A is a worse outcome (Rank 2).

Since the higher priority candidates (B and D) rationally choose to apply to and secure their preferred Rank 1 companies, Company A is left with only Seeker A applying in Step 1 (assuming truthful bidding by all other seekers as well).

By applying truthfully to Company A in Step 1, I secure my Rank 1 choice, which is the optimal outcome. Deviating would only risk losing this match and forcing me to rely on lower-ranked, potentially already filled companies in subsequent steps.",True,Company_A,False,True,1

1. Analyze Company_B (Rank 1):
   - Company_B's priority list places me (Seeker_B) third (P3), behind Seeker_D (P1) and Seeker_A (P2).
   - If either D or A applies to B in Step 1, I lose B.

2. Analyze Competitors (D and A) applications based on their True Preferences:
   - Seeker_D's R1 is Company_C. D has P3 at C. D competes with E (R1, P4). D wins C.
   - Seeker_A's R1 is Company_A. A has P3 at A. A competes only with B (if B applies strategically) or D (if D applies strategically).

3. Determine Competitors' Incentives to Deviate:
   - Seeker_D gets their R1 choice (C) by applying truthfully. D has no incentive to deviate to B (R3).
   - Seeker_A gets their R1 choice (A) by applying truthfully, as the highest priority applicants for A (B, D) are targeting higher preferred companies (B, C/A) respectively, allowing A to secure A uncontested by high-priority seekers.

4. Conclusion for Seeker_B:
   - Since the primary competitors for Company_B (D and A) are successfully matched with their own higher-ranked choices in Step 1 by playing truthfully, Company_B receives only one application in Step 1: mine (Seeker_B).

   Company_C's priority list is [Seeker_C, Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A]. I (Seeker_D) am 3rd priority.

2. Analyze competitors for Company_C:
   - Seeker_C (1st priority for C_C) prefers Company_D (Rank 1). Since Seeker_C is the only applicant to Company_D in Step 1 (assuming sincere submissions), Seeker_C will match with Company_D.

1. Company_C (Rank 1): Seeker_D (P3) and Seeker_E (P4) both apply here in Step 1 (if applying truthfully). Since Seeker_D has higher priority (P3 vs P4), Seeker_D secures C_C. C_C is unreachable.
2. Company_B (Rank 2): Seeker_B applies here in Step 1. Seeker_B is P3 at C_B, and S_D (P1) and S_A (P2) apply elsewhere (C_C and C_A). S_B secures C_B. C_B is unreachable (E is P5).

1. Check if my top choice, Company A, is obtainable if I apply there first.
    - S_A applies to C_A (Rank 1).

2. Analyze C_A's selection in Step 1:

3. Confirm stability against deviation by higher priority seekers for C_A (S_B, S_D):
    - S_B prefers C_B (Rank 1) over C_A (Rank 3). If S_B applies to C_B, S_B gets C_B uncontested. S_B has no incentive to deviate to C_A.
    - S_D prefers C_C (Rank 1) over C_A (Rank 2). If S_D applies to C_C, S_D gets C_C over S_E (S_D is higher priority). S_D has no incentive to deviate to C_A.

1. Initial analysis (Submitting True Preferences (TP)): If everyone submits TP, I match with C_D (R1). However, I must consider strategic behavior by others, as this sequential mechanism is not strategyproof.
2. Strategic Risk Assessment: Seeker_E (S_E) is rejected in the TP scenario and matches with C_E (R5). S_E has high priority (P2) at C_D (S_C's R1), while S_C is P3 at C_D. Since C_D (R4 for S_E) is better than C_E (R5 for S_E), S_E has a strong incentive to strategically deviate and apply to C_D in Step 1.

I must assume that other Job Seekers submit their True Preference Lists, as this is the standard baseline for strategic decision-making in matching experiments.

1. Analyze top preferences (C_C, C_B, C_A):
   - Company_C (Rank 1): Seeker_D applies (R1). Company_C prioritizes S_D (3rd) over S_E (4th). If I apply here, I lose and am rejected.

2. Analyzing Competitor Incentives (B and D):
    * Seeker_B's TPL Rank 1 is Company B. If B applies truthfully to B, B secures B (B is 3rd priority at B, and B is the only applicant if truthful). Since B is Rank 1 for Seeker_B, B has no incentive to deviate to A (Rank 3 for B).

First, I analyzed the outcome if all seekers, including myself, submit their truthful preferences.

This leaves me with Company_E (my #5 preference).

To achieve a better result, I must strategically deviate. I examined my priority rankings across all companies:
* C_C (#1 preference): P4 (Too low)
* C_B (#2 preference): P5 (Too low)
* C_A (#3 preference): P4 (Too low)
* C_D (#4 preference): P2 (High priority)
* C_E (#5 preference): P4 (Low priority)

My highest priority ranking is P2 at Company_D. The highest priority seeker at C_D is S_D (P1).

By strategically placing Company_D as my #1 choice, I exploit the fact that the P1 applicant (S_D) is occupied elsewhere securing their top choice, and I displace the P3 applicant (S_C). 

Step 1 Simulation (S_E applies to C_D):
1. S_D applies to C_C and is admitted.
2. S_B applies to C_B and is admitted.
3. S_A applies to C_A and is admitted.
4. S_E and S_C apply to C_D. Since S_E (P2) has higher priority than S_C (P3), S_E is admitted to C_D.

1. Analyze competition for Company_B:
   Company_B prioritizes Seeker_D (1), Seeker_A (2), and then Seeker_B (3). If S_D or S_A apply to C_B in Step 1, I will be rejected.

3. Analyze actual applicants to Company_B in Step 1 (if everyone submits true preferences):
   - Seeker_B (me) applies to C_B.
   - Seeker_E's Rank 1 is C_C, but S_D applies there and wins (S_D is Prio 3, S_E is Prio 4 at C_C). Wait, S_E's Rank 1 is C_C. Let's recheck the full list of applications.
   - S_E's Rank 1 is C_C. S_D's Rank 1 is C_C. C_C receives S_D (Prio 3) and S_E (Prio 4). S_D is admitted to C_C. S_E is rejected and moves to Step 2 (applying to C_B).
   - S_B (my true preference list) applies to C_B.

2. Anticipating Strategic Deviation: Seeker E knows that if they apply truthfully to C, they are rejected and eventually match with E (Rank 5). However, E has 2nd priority at D, while I have 3rd priority. If E deviates and applies to D in Step 1, and I also apply to D, E beats me (E > C at D) and secures D (Rank 4 for E).

3. Determining Optimal Response: Since E is incentivized to deviate to D (improving their outcome from Rank 5 to Rank 4), I must assume D is lost.

1. Analyze competition for my top choices (D, A, B):
   *   Company D (True Rank 1): Company D prioritizes Seeker E (2nd) over Seeker C (3rd). Seeker E's true preferences are C > B > A > D > E. Since Seeker E knows that applying to C (Rank 1) leads to rejection (due to Seeker D having higher priority at C), and B and A are likely taken by B and A respectively (who are high priority at those firms), Seeker E's optimal strategy is to apply directly to D (E's Rank 4 true preference) in Step 1 to secure a better match than E (Rank 5).
   *   If I apply to D (my Rank 1) and E applies to D (E's strategic Rank 1), E wins D due to higher priority. I would be rejected and end up with E (my Rank 5).
   *   Company A (True Rank 2) and Company B (True Rank 3): I have very low priority (5th and 4th, respectively). A and B are guaranteed to be matched there in Step 1.

2. Analyzing Competitors (S_D and S_A):
    a. Seeker_D's (Priority 1) true top choice is Company C. S_D secures C in Step 1 by applying truthfully, as S_D (3rd priority at C) wins against S_E (4th priority at C), the only other applicant. Since C is S_D's Rank 1 choice, S_D has no incentive to deviate to B (Rank 3 choice).

Analysis assuming all agents submit their true first choice in Step 1:
1. Seeker A applies to Company A.
2. Seeker B applies to Company B.
3. Seeker C applies to Company D.
4. Seeker D (Me) applies to Company C.
5. Seeker E applies to Company C.

Company C receives applications from D and E. Company C's priority list is [Seeker_C, Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A]. Since Seeker D (rank 3) is ranked higher than Seeker E (rank 4), Company C permanently admits Seeker D. 

In this scenario, Seeker D matches with Company C, which is the highest-ranked company (Rank 1) on my True Preference List. 

If I were to deviate, for example, by ranking Company A first, I risk losing Company C to Seeker E. If D applies to A and E applies to C, E secures C (Rank 1 for E), and D secures A (Rank 2 for D, assuming D gets A over A).

I must analyze the likely outcomes of Step 1 assuming all other seekers apply truthfully, as they secure their Rank 1 choices by doing so.

1. **Prediction of Step 1 Outcomes (if all others apply truthfully to their #1 choice):**
    * Company_A (Rank 3): Seeker_A applies (3rd priority). Wins A. (A filled).
    * Company_B (Rank 2): Seeker_B applies (3rd priority). Wins B. (B filled).

    * Company_D (Rank 4): Seeker_C applies (3rd priority). Wins D. (D filled).

If I apply truthfully to C (Rank 1), I am rejected by Seeker_D. Since A, B, and D are also filled, I would be forced to apply to Company_E (Rank 5) in Step 2, resulting in a Rank 5 match.

2. **Strategic Deviation Analysis:**
I must identify the highest preferred company where I can win in Step 1 by deviating my application.

* Company_D (Rank 4): My priority at D is 2nd (behind Seeker_D). Seeker_D's #1 choice is C. Seeker_C's #1 choice is D. If I apply to D in Step 1, the applicants are {Seeker_C, Seeker_E}. Since E (2nd priority) beats C (3rd priority), I secure Company_D immediately.

3. **Conclusion:** By prioritizing Company_D (Rank 4) as my #1 choice, I secure a guaranteed match in Step 1, achieving a Rank 4 outcome, which is strictly better than the Rank 5 outcome resulting from truthful reporting.

2. Seeker_D's top preference is Company_C. Company_C receives applications from S_D and S_E, and Company_C prefers S_D over S_E. S_D is admitted.

Since both higher-priority seekers (S_B and S_D) apply to and secure their first choices elsewhere in Step 1, Company_A receives only my application (Seeker_A) when I apply there first.

1. Analysis of Ranks 1, 2, 3 (C_C, C_B, C_A):
If I submit my true Rank 1 choice (C_C), I compete with Seeker_D, who also ranks C_C first. Seeker_D has higher priority at C_C (3rd vs 4th for Seeker_E). Seeker_E loses and is rejected.

2. Analysis of Rank 4 (C_D):
If I prioritize C_D, I compete with Seeker_C, who also ranks C_D first. Company_D's priority list is S_D (1st) > S_E (2nd) > S_C (3rd).

1. Seeker_B's Rank 1 is Company_B. Seeker_B is highly likely to secure Company_B in Step 1 because the two seekers prioritized above S_B at C_B (S_D and S_A) prefer and secure their own top choices (C_C and C_A, respectively). Therefore, S_B applies to C_B and gets matched.

    * Company_C (Rank 1): Seeker_D applies (TPL Rank 1). D has 3rd priority at C_C; E has 4th priority. E loses.
    * Company_B (Rank 2): Seeker_B applies (TPL Rank 1). B has 3rd priority at C_B; E has 5th priority. E loses.
    * Company_A (Rank 3): Seeker_A applies (TPL Rank 1). A has 3rd priority at C_A; E has 4th priority. E loses.

If I apply truthfully (C_C first), I am rejected, and all my top 4 choices (C_C, C_B, C_A, C_D) are filled in Step 1 by others. I would be relegated to Company_E (Rank 5) in a later step.

2. Analyze Company_D (Rank 4): 
    * Seeker_C applies to C_D (TPL Rank 1). C has 3rd priority at C_D.
    * Seeker_E has 2nd priority at C_D (only behind D).

By strategically listing Company_D as my Rank 1 choice, I apply there in Step 1. Since my 2nd priority at C_D is higher than Seeker_C's 3rd priority, I win the seat immediately in Step 1. This secures a match with Company_D, achieving Rank 4, which is the highest possible outcome given the competition for Ranks 1-3. The remaining choices follow the true preference order as fallback options, although they are unlikely to be available.",False,Company_D,False,True,4

1. Analyze competition for Company_A:
   Company A prioritizes Seekers B, D, A, E, C. I (Seeker A) am 3rd priority.
   If Seekers B or D apply to Company A in Step 1, I would be rejected.

2. Analyze B's and D's incentives:
   Seeker B's true Rank 1 is Company B. Company B only receives an application from B in Step 1 (assuming truthful play by A, C, D, E). B secures Company B (Rank 1).
   Seeker D's true Rank 1 is Company C. D applies to C. D secures Company C (Rank 1), as D has higher priority at C than Seeker E (who also applies to C) and Seeker C applies to D.

3. Anticipate strategic deviation (E): Although I assume truthful play unless deviation is beneficial, I noted that Seeker E benefits by deviating from C to D, securing D (Rank 4) instead of E (Rank 5). Even if E deviates (E applies to D), it does not affect the applications of B or D to A, B, or C respectively.

4. Conclusion on A's outcome:
   In Step 1, neither Seeker B nor Seeker D applies to Company A, as they secure their higher preferred options (B and C, respectively) by applying truthfully.

1. Analyze competition for Company_B (My Rank 1):
   Company_B priorities: Seeker_D (1), Seeker_A (2), Seeker_B (3). I am P3, meaning if D or A apply in Step 1, I lose B permanently.

2. Analyze D's and A's rational Step 1 applications (based on their True Preferences):
   *   Seeker_D prefers C (Rank 1). D has priority P3 at C, competing against E (P4 at C). D is highly likely to secure C by applying truthfully.
   *   Seeker_A prefers A (Rank 1). A has priority P3 at A, competing against B (P1 at A) and D (P2 at A).

3. Predicting the outcome if everyone applies truthfully:
   *   D applies to C (D gets C, Rank 1).
   *   A applies to A (A gets A, Rank 1), since B applies to B and D applies to C, leaving A unopposed at A.
   *   I apply to B (My Rank 1). Since D and A have secured their top choices elsewhere, I am the only applicant at B. I secure B.

Step 1 Simulation (Everyone submits true Rank 1):

The matching process involves immediate, final admissions, meaning if a company fills its single seat in Step 1, it is permanently unavailable.

1. Analyze the outcome of submitting my True Preferences: If Seeker_E applies truthfully (C first), Company_C is taken by Seeker_D (who has higher priority at C, 3rd vs E's 4th). Similarly, Company_B is taken by Seeker_B, and Company_A is taken by Seeker_A, all in Step 1. Seeker_E is rejected and ends up with Company_E (Rank 5).

2. Identify companies where Seeker_E has a strong relative priority: My priority rankings are low (4th or 5th) for C, B, and A. However, I am 2nd priority at Company_D (P_D: [D, E, C, B, A]).

3. Strategic application to Company_D: Seeker_D (1st priority at D) ranks Company_D last (5th) and applies truthfully to Company_C (P1). Seeker_C (3rd priority at D) applies truthfully to Company_D (P1). By submitting Company_D as my Rank 1 choice, I apply in Step 1.

4. Outcome: Matching with Company_D corresponds to Rank 4 on my True Preference List, which is an improvement over the guaranteed Rank 5 if I applied truthfully. Since C, B, and A are likely unattainable due to higher priority competition filling the spots immediately, Rank 4 is the optimal achievable outcome.

1. Analyze competition for Rank 1 choice: Company_C.
   - My priority at C (R_C) is 3rd: [Seeker_C, Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A].
   - Assuming other seekers submit their true preferences, applicants to C in Step 1 are Seeker_D and Seeker_E (both rank C first).

2. Conclusion on Rank 1:
   - Submitting Company_C as Rank 1 ensures a match with Company_C (my highest preference) in Step 1.

3. Strategic Check:
   - If I deviated and applied to Rank 2 (Company_A) first, I would secure A (D is 2nd priority at A, beating A who is 3rd priority). However, Company_C would then be taken by Seeker_E (who is the only remaining applicant to C), resulting in a match with A (Rank 2), which is worse than C (Rank 1).

The matching mechanism is sequential, and admissions are final at each step, meaning companies fill up quickly.

1. Analyze the highly preferred companies (C_C, C_B, C_A):
   - Company_C (Rank 1): Seeker_E is 4th priority (behind S_C, S_B, S_D). If everyone applies truthfully, S_D (3rd priority, P1 choice C_C) will take C_C in Step 1, leaving E rejected and C_C filled.
   - Company_B (Rank 2): Seeker_E is 5th (lowest) priority. S_B (3rd priority, P1 choice C_B) will take C_B in Step 1.
   - Company_A (Rank 3): Seeker_E is 4th priority. S_A (3rd priority, P1 choice C_A) will take C_A in Step 1.
   Applying truthfully to C_C results in rejection and a final match of C_E (Rank 5) because all higher-ranked companies are filled by others in Step 1.

2. Analyze Company_D (Rank 4):
   - Seeker_E is 2nd priority at C_D (behind S_D). S_C is 3rd priority.
   - Crucially, S_D's P1 is C_C. If S_D applies truthfully to C_C, S_D secures C_C in Step 1 (as analyzed above).
   - S_C's P1 is C_D. If S_E applies to C_D in Step 1, the applicants are {S_C, S_E}. Since S_E (2nd priority) beats S_C (3rd priority) at C_D, S_E secures C_D immediately.

3. Conclusion:
   By applying strategically to Company_D first, Seeker_E leverages the fact that the highest priority seeker (S_D) is matched elsewhere, securing Rank 4 (C_D).

1. Analyze competition for Company_B (C_B):
C_B's priority list is [Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_B, ...]. I am the 3rd priority. I must check where S_D (P#1) and S_A (P#2) apply in Step 1.

2. Analyze S_D's strategy:
S_D's #1 choice is C_C. At C_C, S_D is P#3. S_C (P#1) targets C_D. S_B (P#2) targets C_B. S_E (P#4) targets C_C. If S_D applies truthfully to C_C, S_D wins against S_E, securing their Rank #1 choice (C_C). S_D has no incentive to apply to C_B (Rank #3 for S_D).

3. Analyze S_A's strategy:
S_A's #1 choice is C_A. At C_A, S_A is P#3. S_B (P#1) and S_D (P#2) are higher priority.

    * S_A applies to C_A (P1). S_B applies to C_B (P1). S_D applies to C_C (P1). S_A is admitted to C_A because S_B and S_D, who rank higher at C_A, apply elsewhere.

Crucially, Seeker E has a strong incentive to deviate from their truthful rank 1 choice (C) and apply to D in R1, as D (Rank 4 for E) is preferable to the likely outcome of E (Rank 5) if E applies truthfully and is rejected by C. If E deviates to D, D fills immediately (D-E), and A, B, C are also likely filled by their respective R1 applicants (A-A, B-B, C-D). This forces me to E (Rank 5).

To maximize my minimum guaranteed outcome, I must apply to a company where I have high priority and can secure a match in R1.

Company C (Rank 4 preference) ranks Seeker_C 1st (highest priority). If I apply to C in R1, I guarantee a match with C, regardless of whether D or E apply there, or if E deviates to D.

By strategically applying to C first, I secure a guaranteed Rank 4 match, which is superior to the Rank 5 outcome resulting from prioritizing D, A, or B under the assumption of rational strategic play by Seeker E.",False,Company_C,False,False,4

Step 1 Analysis (If all agents play truthfully):
1. Applications to Company C (My Rank 1): Seeker_D and Seeker_E apply.
2. Company C's Priority List: [Seeker_C, Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A].

1. Analysis of Top Choices (C_C, C_B, C_A):
If I apply to my true 1st choice (Company_C), I lose to Seeker_D (D is 3rd priority at C_C, I am 4th priority) because D also applies there in Step 1. Similarly, Company_B is secured by Seeker_B and Company_A by Seeker_A in Step 1, as both B and A apply to their respective companies and face no higher-priority applicants.

2. Analysis of Company_D (Rank 4):
Company_D's priority list is [Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_C, ...]. I am the 2nd highest priority applicant. In the naive scenario (where everyone submits true preferences), Seeker_C applies to C_D (1st choice) and secures the spot because Seeker_D applies to C_C. Seeker_C has 3rd priority at C_D.

3. Strategic Decision:
By placing Company_D as my 1st choice, I ensure I apply to C_D in Step 1. Since Seeker_C also applies to C_D (their 1st choice), we compete. I (Seeker_E) have higher priority (2nd) than Seeker_C (3rd) at Company_D.

The matching procedure is sequential, and matches are final immediately, meaning early rejection can lead to a severe drop in outcome if preferred companies are subsequently filled.

1. Analyze Competition for High-Ranked Choices:
   - Company_D (Rank 1): I am ranked 3rd by C_D. Seeker E is ranked 2nd by C_D. Since Seeker E loses competition at their own Rank 1 (C_C, where D beats E), E is incentivized to strategically apply to C_D. If I apply truthfully to C_D, a rational Seeker E will apply to C_D and win the spot, forcing me to apply to C_E (Rank 5) in later steps.
   - Company_A (Rank 2) / Company_B (Rank 3): I have very low priority (5th at C_A, 4th at C_B). Seekers A and B are likely to secure these spots truthfully, leading to my rejection and subsequent application to C_E (Rank 5).

2. Identify Secure Match:
   - Company_C (Rank 4): I am ranked 1st by C_C. If I apply to C_C in Step 1, I am guaranteed to win against any competition (Seekers D and E apply truthfully here but are ranked 3rd and 4th, respectively). 

3. Determine Strategy:
   To avoid the high risk of falling to Rank 5 (C_E), I must secure the best possible guaranteed outcome. Applying to Company_C (Rank 4) guarantees a match better than C_E. This strategic misrepresentation of my Rank 1 choice is necessary due to the high probability that Seeker E will strategically displace me from C_D.

2. Outcome Analysis:

Step 1 (If all submit truthfully based on Rank 1):

Step 2 (E is rejected):

Result: In the truthful scenario, every seeker matches with their Rank 1 preferred company. Since Seeker_B secures Company_B (Rank 1), this is the optimal outcome.

1. Analyze competition for top choices (C_C, C_B, C_A):

I must analyze whether applying truthfully to Company A (my rank #1) in Step 1 will result in a match, given the sequential and permanent admission rules.

Company A's priority list is: Seeker_B > Seeker_D > Seeker_A > Seeker_E > Seeker_C. I am the 3rd priority.

For me to secure Company A in Step 1, the two seekers preferred over me (B and D) must apply elsewhere and be admitted.

1. Seeker B's True Preference is Company B (Rank 1). Company B's priorities list Seeker D first, and Seeker A second, but Seeker B is 3rd. However, if Seeker B applies to Company B, they are the only applicant (assuming truthful submissions). Thus, Seeker B secures Company B (their #1 choice) in Step 1.
2. Seeker D's True Preference is Company C (Rank 1). Company C receives applications from Seeker D and Seeker E. Company C prefers D over E (D is #3, E is #4). Thus, Seeker D secures Company C (their #1 choice) in Step 1.

Since both Seeker B and Seeker D secure their respective #1 choices by applying truthfully, they have no incentive to deviate and apply to Company A (which is a worse outcome for them: A is B's #3 and D's #2).

5. Since Seeker D has higher priority than Seeker E, Company C admits Seeker D permanently.

1. Analyze competition for top preferences (C, B, A):
   - Company C (Rank 1): My priority is 4. Seeker D (R1 preference for C, P3) and Seeker A (R1 preference for A, but R2 for C, P5) are competitors. If everyone applies truthfully, D applies to C and wins against me (E). C is taken.
   - Company B (Rank 2): My priority is 5. Seeker B (R1 preference for B, P3) applies and wins B. B is taken.
   - Company A (Rank 3): My priority is 4. Seeker A (R1 preference for A, P3) applies and wins A, as higher priority seekers B and D apply elsewhere. A is taken.

If I apply truthfully (starting with C), I would be rejected by C, and subsequent choices (B, A, D) would likely be full by the time I apply, leading to a match with Company E (Rank 5).

2. Strategic Target (Company D):
   - Company D is my Rank 4 preference, but I hold Priority 2 there, only behind Seeker D.
   - Seeker D's true preference for D is Rank 5, meaning D will apply to C in Step 1.
   - The main competitor for D in Step 1 is Seeker C (R1 preference for D), who has Priority 3 at D.

First, I analyze the outcome if all seekers, including myself, apply truthfully to their Rank 1 TPL choice in Step 1:

1. Company C (E's Rank 1) is targeted by D (Rank 1 TPL) and E. Company C prioritizes D (Rank 3) over E (Rank 4). D gets C. C is filled.

3. Company A (E's Rank 3) is targeted by A (Rank 1 TPL). A gets A. A is filled.
4. Company D is targeted by C (Rank 1 TPL). C gets D. D is filled.

In the truthful scenario, E is rejected in Step 1 and ends up with Company E (Rank 5) in Step 2. Companies C, B, and A are secured by higher-priority applicants.

Next, I look for the highest-ranked company on my TPL where I can secure a spot in Step 1 by applying strategically:

*   Company D (Rank 4 on TPL): Target C applies truthfully. Company D's priorities: D > E (Rank 2) > C (Rank 3). Since E has higher priority than C at D, if E targets D in Step 1, E secures D.

1. Seekers' 1st choices: A->C_A, B->C_B, C->C_D, D->C_C, E->C_C.
2. Company C_A receives A. A is admitted (A, C_A).
3. Company C_D receives C. C is admitted (C, C_D).
4. Company C_B receives B. B is admitted (B, C_B). 
   (B is admitted because no seeker with higher priority at C_B (S_D, S_A) applies to C_B in Step 1, as D applies to C_C and A applies to C_A).
5. Company C_C receives D and E. C_C priority: [S_C, S_B, S_D, S_E]. D (S_D) has higher priority than E (S_E). D is admitted (D, C_C).

This matching environment requires sequential applications based on the submitted rank list, with immediate and final admissions.

1. Company B (Rank 1): I am the 3rd priority at Company B (behind Seeker D and Seeker A).

If I deviated and ranked a lower company (e.g., Company_A) first, I would likely be rejected by C_A (due to S_A's higher priority). In the subsequent round, when I apply to Company_D, Seeker_E (who was rejected by C_C) would also apply to C_D (as C_D would be S_E's highest available choice). Since Company_D prefers S_E over me, S_E would secure C_D, pushing me down to a much lower rank.

Step 1 Analysis (Assuming A, B, C, E apply to their R1 choices):
1. Seeker A applies to Company A. (P_A(A) = 3rd)
2. Seeker B applies to Company B. (P_B(B) = 3rd)

Step 1 Analysis (If everyone submits true preferences):
1. Applications:
   - S_A -> C_A
   - S_B -> C_B
   - S_C -> C_D
   - S_D -> C_C (My application for Rank 1)
   - S_E -> C_C

2. Admissions:
   - C_A admits S_A (uncontested).
   - C_B admits S_B (uncontested).
   - C_D admits S_C (uncontested).
   - C_C receives applications from S_D and S_E. C_C's priority list is (S_C, S_B, S_D, S_E...). Since S_C and S_B were admitted elsewhere, S_D (Priority 3) competes with S_E (Priority 4). S_D wins the spot.

3. Result: By submitting my true preference list, I secure Company C (Rank 1) in Step 1 because the two seekers prioritized ahead of me at C_C (S_C and S_B) successfully match with their own Rank 1 choices (C_D and C_B, respectively).

I must analyze the Step 1 outcome under the assumption that other seekers submit their true preference list, as I cannot rely on beneficial deviations from them.

1. True Preferences Simulation (Step 1):
   - S_A applies to A, S_B to B, S_D to C, S_C to D, S_E to C.
   - At C, S_D (3rd priority) beats S_E (4th priority). S_E is rejected.
   - A, B, C, D are all filled in Step 1. S_E is rejected and only matches with E (Rank 5) in later steps.

2. Strategic Analysis:
   - My chances of winning C (Rank 1), B (Rank 2), or A (Rank 3) in Step 1 are zero, as highly preferred competitors (S_D, S_B, S_A respectively) apply there and have higher priority than me (4th or 5th).
   - Company D (Rank 4) is my best chance for a guaranteed match in Step 1. If I apply to D, the only other truthful applicant is S_C (Rank 1 choice for S_C). Company D prefers Seeker_E (2nd priority) over Seeker_C (3rd priority). 

3. Conclusion:
   By applying to Company D first, I secure a guaranteed admission to my Rank 4 choice, preventing the worst-case Rank 5 outcome.

1. Seeker B's Rank 1 choice is Company B. Company B's priorities show Seeker B is 3rd, but Seeker B is the only applicant to Company B in Step 1 (if everyone is truthful). Since B prefers Company B (Rank 1) over Company A (Rank 3), and B secures B by being truthful, B will apply to B.
2. Seeker D's Rank 1 choice is Company C. Company C receives applications from D and E. D has higher priority than E at C (D is 3rd, E is 4th). Since D prefers Company C (Rank 1) over Company A (Rank 2), and D secures C by being truthful, D will apply to C.

Since my main competitors for Company A are likely to match with their preferred companies elsewhere in Step 1, applying truthfully to Company A secures my top choice.

    - Company A (Rank 2): I am 5th priority (P5).
    - Company B (Rank 3): I am 4th priority (P4).
    - Company C (Rank 4): I am 1st priority (P1). This guarantees a match if I apply first.

2. Evaluate risk for Rank 1 choice (D):
    In the truthful scenario, I would get D because P1 (D) and P2 (E) seekers apply elsewhere (C). However, Seeker E receives a Rank 5 match (E) if truthful, while they can achieve a Rank 4 match (D) if they strategically apply to D (where they are P2).

1. Seeker_D's True Rank 1 is Company_C. If D applies to C, D is 3rd priority there, beating Seeker_E (4th priority). D secures C if they apply truthfully.
2. Seeker_A's True Rank 1 is Company_A. If A applies to A, A is 3rd priority there. Since the 1st and 2nd priority seekers at A (B and D) are applying elsewhere (to B and C, respectively), A secures A if they apply truthfully.

Since both higher priority seekers (D and A) for Company_B are expected to apply to and secure their own Rank 1 choices (C and A, respectively) in Step 1, Company_B is likely to receive only my application (Seeker_B) in Step 1.

    - Seeker D (myself) applies to C_C.
    - Seeker E applies to C_C.
3. Since the two higher-priority seekers at C_C are matched elsewhere in Step 1, Company_C chooses between Seeker D (3rd overall priority) and Seeker E (4th overall priority). D is preferred over E.

   *   C_A (Rank 3): S_A applies (P1). C_A prefers S_A (3rd priority) over S_E (4th priority). S_A wins C_A.
   Since these three companies are secured by higher priority applicants in Step 1, applying there first guarantees rejection, and since the market clears quickly, I would be relegated to C_E (Rank 5) in Step 2.

2. Analyze C_D (Rank 4):
   *   C_D Priority: [S_D, S_E, S_C, ...]. S_E is 2nd priority.
   *   In Step 1, S_D applies to C_C, and S_C applies to C_D.
   *   If S_E applies to C_D (P1), the applicants are S_C and S_E. Since C_D prefers S_E (2nd priority) over S_C (3rd priority), S_E is admitted immediately.

Step 1 Analysis (Assuming others play truthfully):

1.  **Target (Company_B):** Company_B ranks me (Seeker_B) 3rd, behind Seeker_D and Seeker_A.

3. If I (Seeker_D) apply to Company_C (Rank 1):
   Company_C receives applications from D (3rd priority) and E (4th priority). Since D has higher priority than E, Company_C admits D permanently. This yields a Rank 1 match.

4. Evaluate the alternative of applying to Company_A (Rank 2) first:
   Company_A receives applications from D and A. Company_A's priority list is [B, D, A, E, C]. Since B applies elsewhere, D (2nd priority) is the highest applicant, beating A (3rd priority). Company_A admits D permanently. This yields a Rank 2 match.

Step 1 Simulation (assuming all seekers submit P_i):

   A -> Company_A (Rank 1)
   B -> Company_B (Rank 1)
   C -> Company_D (Rank 1)
   D -> Company_C (Rank 1)

   * Company_B: Receives B. B is admitted. (B, B).
   * Company_D: Receives C. C is admitted. (C, D).
   * Company_C: Receives D, E. C prefers D (3rd priority) over E (4th priority). D is admitted. (D, C). E is rejected.

Since Company_A receives only one application (from Seeker_A) in Step 1, Seeker_A is guaranteed to be admitted to Company_A if they apply there first, provided no other seeker strategically applies to Company_A and has higher priority. 

Seeker_B is the highest priority applicant for Company_A. However, Company_B is Seeker_B's rank 1 choice. If Seeker_B applies truthfully to Company_B, they secure their rank 1 outcome (B, B). If Seeker_B deviates to apply to Company_A (Rank 3 choice), they would win Company_A, but achieve a Rank 3 outcome, which is worse for them. Thus, Seeker_B has no incentive to deviate from their true preference list to hurt Seeker_A.

1. Analyze Company_B (R1): I am 3rd priority (P3) at B, behind Seeker_D (P1) and Seeker_A (P2). To secure B, both D and A must apply elsewhere and get matched in Step 1.
    * Seeker_D's Rank 1 is C, where D is P3. D is likely to secure C, removing D from competition for B.
    * Seeker_A's Rank 1 is A, where A is P3. Crucially, I (Seeker_B) am P1 at A. If I apply to A, I block A from A. A, anticipating this strategic move, must seek a safer match. A's safest match might be B (R4 for A), where A is P2. If A applies to B, A gets B, and I am rejected, leading me to a lower rank (Rank 3, Company_A, in subsequent steps).

2. Analyzing S_E's incentive: If S_E submits their true preference (P1=C_C), they are rejected in Step 1 (S_D wins C_C) and eventually match with C_E (R5 for S_E). However, S_E has R2 priority at C_D (S_E's R4 choice). If S_E strategically applies to C_D first, they secure C_D (R4 for S_E), improving their outcome. Assuming rational behavior, S_E will deviate, making C_D unavailable to me.

Step 1 Analysis (If everyone submits True Preferences):
1. Applications: A->A, B->B, C->D, D->C, E->C.
2. Company B receives only one application, from Seeker B. Since B has a capacity of 1, Seeker B is immediately admitted to Company B, securing my Rank 1 choice.
3. The other matches are: (A, A), (C, D), (D, C).

Analysis of competition assuming other seekers submit their True Preference Lists (TPL):
1. Company_C (R1): Seeker_D applies (R1 choice). C_C's priority list shows Seeker_D > Seeker_E. If I apply here in Step 1, I lose and get rejected, while C_C is filled by S_D.

1. Analysis of Truth-Telling (Applying to C_C first): If I apply truthfully to C_C (R1), I compete against Seeker_D (who also applies to C_C). Seeker_D has P3 priority at C_C, while I have P4.

2. Strategic Opportunity: To achieve a better rank, I must secure a match in Step 1 by applying to the highest preferred company where I have a winning priority against the truthful Step 1 applicant.

   Company A's priorities rank me (Seeker_A) third (P3), behind Seeker_B (P1) and Seeker_D (P2). I must determine if B or D will apply to A in Step 1.

2. Analyze Seeker_B's behavior:
   B's True Preference is B > D > A. If B applies to B (Rank 1), B secures B (as B is the only applicant for B in the truthful scenario). If B applied to A (Rank 3), B would secure A, but A is ranked lower than B. B has no incentive to deviate from applying to B.

3. Analyze Seeker_D's behavior:
   D's True Preference is C > A > B. If D applies to C (Rank 1), D secures C (D is prioritized over E at C). If D applied to A (Rank 2), D would secure A, but A is ranked lower than C. D has no incentive to deviate from applying to C.

4. Conclusion on Step 1:
   Since the higher priority seekers (B and D) are rationally motivated to apply to their preferred, high-priority options (B and C, respectively), Company A is likely to receive an application only from Seeker_A in Step 1.

1. Analyze the outcome if Seeker_E submits the True Preference List (TPL): In Step 1, S_E applies to C_C (Rank 1). S_D also applies to C_C (Rank 1). Since S_D (3rd priority at C_C) is preferred over S_E (4th priority at C_C), S_D wins C_C. S_E is rejected. C_A and C_B are also filled by S_A and S_B, respectively. S_E is eventually matched with C_E (Rank 5), as all higher choices are filled.

2. Determine if a higher rank (1, 2, or 3) is attainable: S_E has very low priority at C_C (4th), C_B (5th), and C_A (4th). In all cases, the companies are highly likely to be filled in Step 1 by higher-priority seekers (S_D, S_A, S_B) who apply there based on their TPLs. Therefore, attempting Ranks 1, 2, or 3 first leads to immediate rejection and failure to secure those spots.

3. Identify the highest attainable rank through strategic application: Consider C_D (Rank 4). S_E is the 2nd highest priority at C_D (behind S_D). In Step 1 (if others are truthful), C_D receives applications from S_C (3rd priority) and S_E (if S_E lists C_D first). Since S_D applies to C_C, S_D does not compete at C_D in Step 1.

4. Strategic Decision: By setting C_D as the 1st choice, C_D receives applications from S_E (P: 2nd) and S_C (P: 3rd). S_E wins the match immediately in Step 1, securing C_D (Rank 4).

1. Analysis of C_D (Rank 1): I am 3rd priority at C_D. Seeker_E (S_E) is 2nd priority at C_D. S_E's true Rank 1 is C_C, but S_E is 4th priority there and is beaten by S_D (3rd priority) if both apply truthfully. S_E has a strong incentive to strategically deviate to C_D (Rank 4 for S_E) to improve their outcome over getting C_E (Rank 5). If S_E applies to C_D, I lose C_D.

2. Analysis of C_A (Rank 2) and C_B (Rank 3): Seeker_A (S_A) and Seeker_B (S_B) are likely to secure C_A and C_B respectively in Step 1 by applying truthfully, as they are the only applicants and neither has a strong incentive to deviate elsewhere. If I am rejected from C_D (due to S_E), C_A and C_B will likely be closed by the time I apply in subsequent steps.

3. Analysis of C_C (Rank 4): I am 1st priority at C_C. Even if S_D and S_E apply truthfully to C_C, I beat them both. By applying to C_C in Step 1, I guarantee a match with my Rank 4 choice.

- Seeker_E applies to Company_C.
- I (Seeker_C) apply to Company_D.

I analyzed the outcome assuming all seekers submit their True Preference Lists (TPLs), as this often represents the natural starting point for rational agents seeking their top choice.

Step 1 Analysis (If all submit TPLs):
1. Applications to Company_C (My Rank 1): Seeker_D and Seeker_E.
2. Company_C Priority List: ['Seeker_C', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_A'].
3. Seeker_D (Rank 3) is preferred over Seeker_E (Rank 4) by Company_C.
4. Crucially, the two seekers ranked higher than me at Company_C (S_C and S_B) apply elsewhere for their own Rank 1 choices (S_C -> C_D; S_B -> C_B). Since S_C and S_B achieve their Rank 1 choices, they have no incentive to deviate and apply to C_C, which is ranked lower for them (Rank 4 for S_C, Rank 5 for S_B).

Since submitting Company_C as my Rank 1 choice guarantees a match with C_C (my highest preference) under the assumption of rational behavior by others, this is my optimal strategy. Any deviation to apply for a lower-ranked company (e.g., C_A) would result in a worse outcome (Rank 2 match with C_A, as demonstrated in the scratchpad analysis).",True,Company_C,False,True,1

1. Analysis of Competition (Assuming other seekers submit their True Preferences):
If I submit my true preference (Company_C) in Step 1, I analyze the competition. Company_C receives applications from Seeker_D and Seeker_E (me). Company_C's priority list (R_C) ranks Seeker_D above Seeker_E. Thus, Seeker_D secures Company_C, and I am rejected. Similarly, Company_B, Company_A, and Company_D are all secured in Step 1 by seekers who have higher priority than me and target those companies (Seeker_B gets B, Seeker_A gets A, Seeker_C gets D/Seeker_D gets C).
If I apply truthfully, I am rejected repeatedly and end up matched with Company_E (Rank 5).

2. Strategic Identification of Highest Achievable Match:
I must find a company where a higher priority seeker is applying elsewhere in Step 1, allowing me to win the competition.
I examine Company_D (Rank 4). My priority at D (R_D) is 2nd: [Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_C, ...].
- Seeker_D (1st priority) applies to Company_C (P_D[1]=C) and secures it.
- Seeker_C (3rd priority) applies to Company_D (P_C[1]=D).
- If I, Seeker_E, apply to Company_D in Step 1, I compete against Seeker_C. Since R_D ranks Seeker_E higher than Seeker_C, I secure Company_D immediately.

3. Conclusion:
Since achieving Rank 1, 2, or 3 is blocked by competitors with higher priority applying in Step 1, securing Company_D (Rank 4) by applying immediately is the optimal strategy. I must place Company_D first on my Choice Ranking List.",False,Company_D,False,True,4

   - Company D receives {C}. Since C is the only applicant, C is matched (D-C).
