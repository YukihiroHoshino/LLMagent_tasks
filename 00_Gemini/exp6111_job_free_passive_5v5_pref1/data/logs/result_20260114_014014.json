I have already applied three times without success, indicating Company_C (which ranks me 4th) was holding out for higher-ranked seekers (A, B, or C). Since Company_C is still available, it suggests that those preferred seekers have likely matched elsewhere, making me the most preferred available candidate for C (assuming S_E is the only other available seeker, ranked 5th by C).

I have applied repeatedly (4 times) to Company_C without success, indicating they were holding out for higher priority candidates (Seeker_A, B, or C). Since we are in Round 6 and Company_C is the last remaining company (implying 4 seekers are matched), it is highly likely that Company_C's preferred candidates are now unavailable. Therefore, Seeker_D is likely the highest remaining available candidate for Company_C (or close to it).
