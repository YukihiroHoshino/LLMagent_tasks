This means applying immediately carries a high risk of rejection if higher-priority seekers (A, B, C, D) are still available and interested. Given that my top choice (Company_E) is still unmatched, it is strategically beneficial to hold off on a formal application to B, especially since the optimal stable match scenario might see me paired with E if Seeker_A and Seeker_C take B and C respectively. I will use [TALK] to signal strong interest to Company_B, keeping my option open while gathering information and allowing the market dynamics to unfold regarding the highest-priority seekers."
