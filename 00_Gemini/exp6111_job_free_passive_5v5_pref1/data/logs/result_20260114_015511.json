However, Seeker_D has applied immediately in Round 1 and stated that Company_D is their top preference. While I ideally prefer A, B, or C, the competition for those top candidates is extremely high (all other companies share the same priority list). Accepting Seeker_D guarantees a stable, immediate match with a highly motivated applicant, securing my quota in Round 1. Rejecting them risks losing the quota entirely if A, B, and C match elsewhere, or if I don't receive applications from them.

Given the high competition for Company_A (it is Seeker_B's top choice, and they rank 2nd for A), applying immediately when I am the lowest priority is likely to result in rejection or a provisional acceptance that is overridden later.
