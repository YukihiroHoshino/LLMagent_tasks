It is Round 1, and all preferred companies (D, A, C) are still available. Applying to Company_E now is premature as it prevents me from pursuing higher-ranked options if they become available in later pairings. Company_E ranks me 4th, meaning I am unlikely to be accepted if higher-ranked seekers (A, B, C) apply. Therefore, I will use the [TALK] tag to maintain contact without committing to an application, reserving my application power for top choices."

Seeker_B, in particular, ranks me as their second choice (P2), making them a very desirable and attainable target. To maximize my utility, I must hold out for a higher-ranked candidate (P1 or P2).
