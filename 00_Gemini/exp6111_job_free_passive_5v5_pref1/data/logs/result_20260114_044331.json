Our core mission at Company_D is focused on engineering innovative, scalable solutions for rapid market deployment, particularly within the intersection of AI and sustainable infrastructure. Our current projects are challenging, high-impact, and require significant collaboration. Regarding new hires, while specific technical proficiency in data architecture and cloud native development is crucial, we place immense value on adaptability, intellectual curiosity, and a demonstrated ability to thrive in ambiguous, fast-paced environments. What aspects of our mission or what specific technological challenge excites you most about potentially joining us?",

However, I must keep Seeker_E engaged, as they are part of the pool of available candidates. I will answer their inquiry about our mission and skill priorities positively to maintain interest, using the [TALK] tag."
