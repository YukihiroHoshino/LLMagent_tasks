Analysis shows that my priority at my top choices (N_B: R5, N_C: R5) is too low to secure them, as other parents (P_B, P_C, P_D) have higher priority and prefer them highly. My priority at N_A is R3, but parents P_E (R1) and P_D (R2) also prefer N_A and will eventually propose there and displace me, regardless of whether I propose N_A first or third, resulting in my rejection from N_A.

Simulations show that under truthful reporting ([B, C, A, E, D]), the Parent-Proposing DA mechanism, followed by the 'Blocking Parent' removal (Part 2), leads inevitably to a final stable match at N_E (Rank 4). For example, the truthful submission triggers a blocking parent intervention that results in a Rerun, yielding N_E.

Since N_E (where I have Rank 1 priority) is the highest achievable rank that can be secured against competitors, the optimal strategy is to submit a list that prioritizes N_E to achieve this outcome immediately and stably, thereby avoiding the complexity and instability associated with triggering the Part 2 intervention.

Although the Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm is generally robust to manipulation, strategic deviation can sometimes lead to a stable matching that is better for the proposer than the stable matching achieved by truthful reporting. 

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission: If Parent_B submits ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'], they apply to N_A first. Parent_B has low priority (Rank 4) at N_A. P_B is ultimately rejected from N_A by P_E (Rank 1) in Round 3 and ends up matched with N_D (4th choice).

2. Priority Analysis: Parent_B has high priority at N_B (Rank 2) and N_C (Rank 1). N_B is Parent_B's 2nd true choice.

3. Strategic Deviation: By applying to N_B first, Parent_B leverages their high priority. In Round 1, N_B receives applications from P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D. Since Parent_B (Rank 2) has the highest priority among these applicants (P_A: 5, P_C: 3, P_D: 4), P_B is admitted to N_B immediately. The only parent N_B prefers more, P_E (Rank 1), applied to N_C in Round 1.

4. Outcome: This deviation secures N_B, Parent_B's 2nd true choice, which is superior to the 4th choice obtained by truthful reporting. Subsequent analysis confirms this resulting matching is stable (M'), and since no 'blocking parents' are identified in Part 2, this outcome is final.

I first simulated the outcome where all agents (including Parent_C) submit their true preferences. 

1. Initial DA Run (True Preferences):
   Parent_C initially proposes to Nursery_B (Rank 1). N_B holds P_C over P_A and P_D based on priority. The process stabilizes after several rounds, resulting in an allocation where P_C is matched with N_B.

2. Stability Check (Part 2):
   The initial run identified blocking parents (P_E at N_C, P_A at N_A). Their lists were modified, and the DA algorithm was rerun.

3. Final DA Rerun:
   In the final stable matching achieved after the rerun, Parent_C remains matched with Nursery_B (Rank 1).

I simulated the entire process assuming Parent_D submits their true preferences: ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D']. 

1. Initial DA (Part 1) resulted in Parent_D matching with N_A (Rank 3).
2. Blocking parents (P_A at N_A, P_D at N_C) were identified, leading to waivers and a rerun.

4. Rerun 2 resulted in Parent_D matching with N_B (Rank 1).
5. This final assignment (M2) was stable under the Part 2 criteria.

However, the Part 2 mechanism introduces complexity by modifying the submitted lists of parents who temporarily blocked others but did not secure that position in the final Part 1 outcome.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Bidding): If Parent_E submits their True Preference List ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'], the Part 1 DA results in an allocation where Parent_E matches with Nursery_A (3rd choice).

2. Part 2 Correction: This initial allocation is unstable due to blocking parents (Parent_B at Nursery_A and Parent_D at Nursery_C). The system removes Nursery_A from Parent_B's list and Nursery_C from Parent_D's list, and reruns Part 1.

3. Rerun Outcome: The resulting stable matching after this correction yields Parent_E matching with Nursery_D (2nd choice).

4. Strategic Consideration: Since the truthful submission leads to Parent_E's 2nd choice after the full mechanism resolves instabilities caused by other parents, this is the highest preference achievable for Parent_E, as they lack the priority (4th at C) to secure their 1st choice (Nursery_C).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_B): Parent_C also prefers N_B first. N_B prioritizes Parent_C (Rank 3) over Parent_D (Rank 4). Therefore, N_B is unattainable if Parent_C applies.

2. Target Rank 2 (Nursery_C): This is the highest achievable rank.

3. Standard DA Simulation (Submitting True Preferences: [N_B, N_C, ...]): This simulation yields a stable match M** where Parent_D is assigned N_C (Rank 2). However, this outcome involves Parent_C being temporarily admitted to N_B (R1) and later rejected by Parent_B (R4), causing Parent_C to become a 'blocking Parent' at N_B.

4. Part 2 Execution: Because P_C is a blocking parent, N_B is removed from P_C's list, and the DA procedure reruns. This rerun (M***) results in Parent_D being matched to N_A (Rank 3), a worse outcome than N_C.

5. Strategic Misrepresentation: To secure N_C (Rank 2) and avoid triggering the detrimental Part 2 procedure, I must ensure that the initial stable allocation does not contain blocking parents. By submitting N_C as my first choice ([N_C, N_B, ...]), I apply directly to N_C in Round 1. In this scenario (M2):
    - P_D secures N_C immediately in R1 (displacing P_E).
    - P_C secures N_B in R1.
    - Since P_C holds N_B throughout the process (P_B applies to N_A first), P_C is never rejected by N_B. Thus, P_C does not become a blocking parent.

1. Standard Deferred Acceptance (DA) analysis using true preferences shows that Parent_A is matched with Nursery_A (Rank 3). This is the Parent-optimal stable matching (M_DA).
2. However, the matching environment includes Part 2, which eliminates 'blocking Parents' by removing the blocking nursery from the parent's list and rerunning DA. In M_DA, Parent_A becomes a blocking Parent at Nursery_B (R1) and Nursery_C (R2) because A's temporary admissions caused rejections but A ultimately moved to A.

4. Attempts to manipulate (e.g., promoting Nursery_A or Nursery_E) either resulted in the same Rank 4 outcome or a worse Rank 5 outcome, suggesting that Rank 4 is likely the best achievable rank given the priorities and the stability mechanism.
5. Since submitting the true preference list maximizes the chances of reaching the P-optimal outcome (Rank 3) before instability is resolved, and yields the highest observed outcome (Rank 4) in the complex environment, Parent_A should submit their true preferences.",True,Nursery_E,False,True,4

4. P_B is finally matched with N_B (2nd choice).

Since P_B's temporary admission at N_A in R1 caused no rejections, P_B is not a blocking parent at N_A.

1.  **True Preference Outcome (Part 1):** Tracing the DA algorithm with Parent E's true list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'] resulted in Parent E matching with Nursery A (Rank 3).

1. Analyzing Nursery_A (Rank 1):
My priority at N_A is Rank 4 (behind P_E, P_D, P_A). Parent_E (Rank 1 priority) lists N_A as their 3rd choice. In any scenario where I apply to N_A early, P_E will eventually apply (by R3 unless matched earlier to N_C or N_D) and displace me due to higher priority. N_A is likely unattainable.

My priority at N_B is Rank 2 (behind P_E). P_C (Rank 3 priority) lists N_B as their 1st choice. If I submit my true preference (N_A first), N_B is applied to by P_A, P_C, P_D in R1. P_C secures N_B (Rank 3 priority), and I end up at N_D (Rank 4).

1. **Execute Part 1 (P-DA) with truthful submissions:**

2. **Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check):**
   - A Parent is blocking if TA caused rejection AND TA != FA. Since P_C's temporary admission (TA=B) equals their final admission (FA=B), P_C cannot be a blocking parent. Therefore, Part 2 does not modify P_C's list or change their outcome.

3. **Conclusion:** Since P_C achieves their highest ranked school (Rank 1, Nursery_B) through truthful submission, this is the optimal strategy. No manipulation can yield a better result.",True,Nursery_C,True,False,2

In standard DA, submitting true preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing agents (Parents) to achieve the Parent-optimal stable matching. I first analyze the outcome if Parent_D submits their True Preference List (TPL). 

1. Check feasibility of Rank 1 (Nursery_B):
   In Round 1, P_D applies to N_B along with P_A and P_C. N_B prioritizes P_C (3rd) over P_D (4th). P_C is admitted to N_B and remains matched there throughout Part 1. Thus, N_B is unattainable for P_D.

2. Check feasibility of Rank 2 (Nursery_C):
   P_D applies to N_C in Round 2 (after rejection from N_B). At this point, P_C (the high-priority competitor for N_C) is secured at N_B. P_D wins the spot at N_C, bumping P_E. P_D remains matched with N_C until the end of Part 1. 

3. Outcome Stability (Part 2):
   The resulting match M = {(P_A, N_A), (P_C, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_D), (P_B, N_E)} is the stable matching. I verified that no parent meets both criteria for being a 'blocking parent' (temporary admission causing rejection AND mismatch with final allocation). Therefore, the process concludes with M, and P_D gets N_C (Rank 2).

4. Strategic Deviation Analysis:
   If P_D strategically submits N_C first, P_D secures N_C initially. However, this allows P_B to eventually bump P_C from N_B. P_C then applies to N_C and, having higher priority than P_D at N_C, bumps P_D, forcing P_D down to N_A (Rank 3).

1. DAA Simulation (Truthful Preferences):
   - Parent E proposes N_C (Rank 1) in R1, is temporarily accepted.
   - In R2, Parent D proposes N_C. Since N_C prioritizes P_D (Rank 3) over P_E (Rank 4), P_D takes the seat, and P_E is rejected.
   - In R3, P_E proposes N_D (Rank 2). N_D is available, and P_E is accepted.
   - The final stable assignment for P_E is N_D (Rank 2).

2. Strategic Analysis:
   - P_E cannot obtain N_C because P_D has higher priority at N_C and claims it before P_E can secure a better match elsewhere.
   - Since the truthful submission yields N_D (Rank 2), and this is the highest preferred school available to P_E in the stable matching, manipulation is unlikely to improve the outcome. Attempting to prioritize N_A (Rank 3) instead of N_C/N_D resulted in P_E matching with N_A (Rank 3), which is worse.

3. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2):
   - The mechanism includes a complex check for 'blocking parents,' but the instructions explicitly state that this process 'will never change your final admission.' This reinforces the finding that the stable outcome achieved by truthful submission is the best achievable result for Parent E.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_B: [A, B, C, D, E]): The initial run of DA yields a stable matching $S^*$, where Parent_B matches with Nursery_B (2nd choice). However, Parent_C is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_B (N_B) because P_C temporarily held N_B but ultimately moved to N_D. 
2. Rerun Effect: When N_B is removed from P_C's list and DA is rerun, the resulting final allocation $S^{**}$ places Parent_B at Nursery_E (5th choice), a significantly worse outcome.
3. Manipulation Strategy: To maximize the outcome, Parent_B must secure the highest possible preference early and prevent the blocking parent scenario that triggers the detrimental rerun. Nursery_A (1st choice) is unreachable because Parent_E has higher priority at N_A. Nursery_B (2nd choice) is highly reachable (Parent_B is 2nd priority at N_B, ahead of P_C, P_D, P_A).
4. Optimal Submission: By ranking Nursery_B first (P'_B: [B, A, C, D, E]), Parent_B applies directly to N_B in Round 1.

1. Analyze the outcome if P_E submits P_T (Truthful Submission):
   Running the DAA (Part 1) with P_T results in P_E being matched to Nursery_A (3rd choice). This happens because P_E applies to N_C (1st choice) in R1, is temporarily admitted, but is displaced by Parent_D in R2 (P_D has higher priority at N_C and applies after being rejected from N_B).
   Since the resulting matching (M_T) has no blocking parents, N_A is the final outcome if P_T is submitted.

2. Attempt to achieve N_C (1st choice):
   N_C is highly competitive, especially against P_D (3rd priority) and P_C (2nd priority). P_E is 4th priority. If P_E applies to N_C first, P_D will always displace P_E in R2, forcing P_E down the list.

3. Attempt to achieve N_D (2nd choice) via misrepresentation:
   If P_E submits P_S = ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'] (swapping 1st and 2nd choices):
   R1: P_E applies to N_D. N_D admits P_E (N_D priorities: P_E is 4th, but is the only applicant).
   P_E secures N_D immediately. P_D still applies to N_B and then N_C, securing N_C (P_D's 2nd true choice).

1.  **Determine the Stable Matching (M*) based on True Preferences:** A step-by-step P-DA calculation using all agents' true preferences shows the unique stable matching M* results in Parent_A matching with Nursery_E (Rank 4).

2.  **Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents) on M*:** In M*, Parent_A temporarily held N_A (Rank 3) in Round 3, rejecting Parent_B, before being rejected by Parent_D in Round 6. Since M*(P_A) = N_E, Parent_A is identified as a blocking parent at N_A. The rules dictate that N_A must be removed from Parent_A's choice list, and the process is rerun.

3.  **Determine the Final Outcome:** The rerun (Rerun 1) with Parent_A's list restricted to [B, C, E, D] yields a new stable matching (M2) where Parent_A still matches with N_E (Rank 4). M2 is stable and contains no blocking parents, making N_E the final assignment for Parent_A.

4.  **Strategic Conclusion:** Any attempt by Parent_A to strategically prioritize N_A (Rank 3) or N_B/N_C (Rank 1/2) fails because higher priority parents (P_D, P_E, P_B, P_C) prevent P_A from securing those spots.

1. Initial DA Run (True Preferences): Parent_B initially secures Nursery_A but is later rejected by Parent_A (R3) due to priority differences. Parent_B eventually matches with Nursery_B (Rank 2). The final matching (M) is: {(P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_A)}.

2. Blocking Check (Part 2): The procedure identifies Parent_A as a blocking Parent at Nursery_A in Round 3, because P_A's temporary admission caused P_B's rejection, but P_A ultimately moved to N_E. 

3. Waiver and Rerun: The system forces P_A to waive N_A. When the DA algorithm is rerun with this reduced list for P_A, Parent_B proposes to N_A (1st choice) and secures the position permanently, as the high-priority Parent_E now proposes elsewhere earlier, and P_A is prevented from proposing to N_A.

1. Initial DA run (M1) assuming all parents submit true preferences:
   Parent_C is temporarily admitted to N_B in Round 1 but is rejected in Round 4 by Parent_B (who has higher priority at N_B). Parent_C ends up matched with N_C (Rank 2).

2. Analysis of Part 2:
   The key to Parent_C being rejected from N_B was Parent_B being rejected from their preferred choice, N_A, by Parent_A. Parent_A was identified as a 'blocking Parent' at N_A because P_A secured N_A temporarily but ultimately matched N_E. 

3. Rerun DA (M2) after P_A's list modification:
   When N_A is removed from P_A's list, P_A proposes to N_B and N_C earlier, but skips N_A entirely. This allows Parent_B (who proposed to N_A first) to remain matched with N_A throughout the process, as no parent with higher priority (P_D or P_A) successfully proposes to N_A afterward in M2.

4. Final Outcome (M2):
   P_B matches N_A (1st choice). P_C remains matched with N_B (1st choice). 

Since submitting the true preference list leads to the optimal outcome (N_B, Rank 1) after the system applies the corrective Part 2 mechanism, and attempts to manipulate (e.g., prioritizing N_C) lead to a worse outcome (N_C, Rank 2), submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.",True,Nursery_C,False,True,2

First, I determine the outcome of the standard DA algorithm (Part 1) assuming all parents submit their true preferences (including Parent_D's true list: B, C, A, E, D).
1. Parent_D's most preferred choice, Nursery_B, is unattainable because Parent_C (P_C) has higher priority (P_C > P_D) at N_B and P_C also prefers N_B most and secures it in Round 1.
2. The DA process results in Parent_D being matched to Nursery_C (Rank 2).

Since N_C is the highest ranked attainable nursery for Parent_D in the stable matching, this is the best possible outcome for Parent_D.

Second, I consider Part 2 (Blocking Parents check). The mechanism states that the automatic waiver triggered by a blocking parent 'will never change your final admission.'

Verification (assuming all parents submit truthfully):
1. Initial DA (Part 1) results in P_E matching with N_A (Rank 3).

3. Rerunning DA (M') with P_C's truncated list leads to P_E matching with N_D (Rank 2).

Since N_D (Rank 2) is the best attainable outcome (as Rank 1, N_C, is unattainable due to P_C's higher priority at N_C), and a test deviation (placing N_D first) resulted in a worse outcome (N_A, Rank 3), the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,Nursery_D,False,True,2

2. Blocking Parent Analysis (Part 2): Although the initial DA output is stable, the temporary assignments leading up to it contained blocking parents (P_C at N_B in R1, P_D at N_C in R2). The system applies waivers (removing N_C from P_D's list, then N_C from P_E's list) and reruns DA.

1. Initial Truthful DA (Part 1): If all parents submit their true preferences ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A'], Parent_C initially secures N_B (R1). However, Parent_B (higher priority at N_B) is rejected from N_A by Parent_A (R3) and subsequently displaces Parent_C from N_B (R4). Parent_C eventually settles for N_C (Rank 2).

3. Rerunning DA: With Parent_A's list adjusted, the simulation stabilizes immediately. Parent_B secures N_A (its 1st choice) in R1 because Parent_A no longer applies to N_A.

The simulation shows that when submitting the true list [C, D, A, E, B], P_E is displaced by P_D at N_C in Round 2, making N_C fundamentally unattainable for P_E.

1. Calculate the outcome using True Preferences (L_A = B, C, A, E, D).

2. Analysis of Third Preference (A): Parent_A has 3rd priority at Nursery_A (E > D > A > B > C). Parent_D (2nd priority) also lists A as a high preference (3rd choice).

I checked the trace of Part 1. Any parent who caused a rejection (Prevention condition) ended up retaining that seat in $M^F$ (no Discrepancy). Thus, no blocking parents are found. The process terminates immediately, confirming the final assignment for Parent_C is N_B.

2. Targeting C (1st choice): Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_D (3rd) over Parent_E (4th). Since Parent_D prefers C (2nd choice) over D (5th choice) and is rejected early from their 1st choice (B), Parent_D will secure C in Round 2, regardless of Parent_E applying first. Thus, C is unattainable.

3. Targeting D (2nd choice): Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_E (4th) higher than Parent_B (5th), who secured D in the true preference matching ($M^*$). If Parent_E applies to D first, they might secure it.

4. Manipulation Test: Parent_E submits a Choice Ranking List $R_E' = ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B']$, prioritizing D over C.

5. Rerunning DA with $R_E'$ (Part 1): By applying to D first, Parent_E is temporarily accepted at D (T1). When Parent_B is rejected from A in R4 and applies to D (P4), Parent_E (4th priority at D) successfully holds the seat against Parent_B (5th priority). The resulting stable matching $M'$ is (A, P_A), (B, P_C), (C, P_D), (D, P_E), (E, P_B). Parent_E is matched to Nursery_D (2nd choice).

6. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2): Since Parent_E remains matched to Nursery_D, they satisfy the final admission requirement. Although Parent_E caused a rejection (P_B in R4), the Discrepancy condition (P's final match $\neq$ N) fails. Therefore, Parent_E is not a blocking parent, and the matching $M'$ is final.

Since Parent_C is guaranteed their Rank 1 choice (Nursery_B) and is never a blocking parent, submitting the true preference list maximizes their utility and ensures this outcome is retained, regardless of adjustments made to other parents' lists in Part 2.",True,Nursery_C,False,True,2

1. Analyze the attainability of Rank 1 (Nursery B): Parent D (P_D) is ranked 4th at N_B. Parent C (P_C) is ranked 3rd at N_B. Since P_C also prefers N_B first, and P_C has higher priority than P_D at N_B, P_D will be rejected by N_B in the first round if P_C submits truthfully (which is generally assumed for DA).

2. Analyze the outcome if Parent D submits the True Preference List (TPL), assuming all others do too (as DA is usually strategy-proof for proposers):
   - R1: P_A, P_C, P_D apply to N_B. P_C is accepted (highest priority), P_D rejected.
   - R2: P_D applies to N_C (Rank 2). N_C receives P_D, P_A, and P_E (current holder). N_C priority: P_D (3rd) > P_E (4th) > P_A (5th). P_D is accepted.
   - Final Outcome (M(TPL)): P_D matches with N_C (Rank 2).

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): When the TPL matching M(TPL) is executed, no parent who was temporarily admitted and caused rejections ultimately moves to a different final match. Therefore, no blocking parents are found, and the outcome P_D -> N_C is stable and final.

4. Conclusion: Since Rank 1 (N_B) is unattainable due to P_C's higher priority, and submitting the TPL yields N_C (Rank 2), which is the next best choice, truth-telling is the optimal strategy here.",True,Nursery_B,False,True,1

Although Part 2 modifies the process, the core DAA structure suggests that manipulating preferences is unlikely to yield a better outcome than the best stable match achievable by submitting true preferences.

I simulated the process based on all agents submitting their true preferences (T):
1. Initial DAA run results in $P_E \sim N_A$ (3rd choice).
2. Part 2 identifies $P_C$ and $P_A$ as blocking parents, leading to the removal of $N_B$ from $P_C$'s list and $N_A$ from $P_A$'s list.
3. Rerunning DAA with these modified lists results in the final match $P_E \sim N_D$ (2nd choice).

Since $N_D$ (2nd choice) is the best outcome achieved for $P_E$ under the truthful strategy, and attempts to manipulate (e.g., swapping $N_D$ and $N_C$) resulted in a worse outcome ($P_E \sim N_A$, 3rd choice), the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,Nursery_D,False,True,2

I first ran the DA algorithm using Parent_A's true preferences ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D']. This simulation resulted in Parent_A being matched with Nursery_E (Rank 4). 

Crucially, Parent_A has very low priority at their top three choices (N_B, N_C, N_A), making it impossible to secure those spots against higher-priority applicants who also prefer them. For instance, P_A is rank 5 at N_B and N_C, and rank 3 at N_A, but P_E (rank 1 at N_A) always displaces P_A.

Since the resulting allocation (P_A -> N_E) did not generate any 'blocking Parents' in the subsequent check (Part 2), this allocation is the final stable outcome.

1. Initial Analysis (True Preferences: ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A']): Running the full procedure with all parents submitting true preferences showed that Parent_C initially secured N_B but was subsequently rejected by Parent_B (who has higher priority at N_B) in the intermediate stages (M''). This rejection resulted in Parent_C being identified as a Blocking Parent at N_B, forcing the system to remove N_B from Parent_C's effective ranking list for the final run (M''').

3. Strategic Manipulation Check: Testing strategic submissions (e.g., listing N_C first) showed that while Parent_C avoided the BP status, N_B was secured by Parent_B (who has higher priority), making N_C the best achievable outcome regardless.

In standard DA mechanisms where parents propose, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy, guaranteeing the Parent-Optimal stable match (the best stable match for the parent). 

1. Calculate the outcome if all parents submit their True Preference Lists (P^T):
   - Parent_D's top choice is N_B. However, Parent_C also prefers N_B (Rank 1) and has higher priority at N_B (P_C is 3rd priority, P_D is 4th). If P_C submits P^T, P_C will secure N_B, blocking P_D.
   - P_D is rejected by N_B and moves to the second choice, N_C. P_D has high priority at N_C (3rd overall, and higher than P_E who applies first).
   - The resulting P-optimal stable match yields P_D matched with N_C (Rank 2).

2. Analyze the impact of Part 2:
   - In the initial DA run (using P^T), P_C and P_A were identified as blocking parents, leading to P_A's list being modified first. This resulted in a revised stable matching (M1) where P_D still matched N_C, and no further blocking parents were found.

3. Analyze manipulation possibilities:
   - Since N_B is unattainable due to P_C's superior priority and preference, P_D cannot achieve Rank 1.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (Standard DA):
If Parent_E submits their true preferences, the stable matching results in Parent_E being matched with Nursery_A (Rank 3). Nursery_C (Rank 1) is unattainable because Parent_D has higher priority at Nursery_C and proposes to it in Round 2, displacing Parent_E.

2. Strategic Manipulation:
Since Parent_E cannot secure N_C, the next best option is N_D (Rank 2). N_D ranks Parent_E fourth out of five, but Parent_D has the highest priority.
If Parent_E proposes to N_D first (by placing N_D at rank 1), Parent_E secures N_D temporarily in Round 1, as Parent_D proposes to N_B. Parent_D is rejected from N_B and proposes to N_C in Round 2, securing N_C (Rank 2 for P_D).

4. Blocking Parent Check:
The resulting matching is stable (S'). We check if any parent is a 'blocking parent'.

Since Parent_A has the lowest priority at their top two choices (B and C) and only medium priority at A, attempting to manipulate the list by prioritizing A, C, or B first resulted in immediate rejection or being forced to waive the nursery later, ultimately leading back to Nursery_E (the 4th choice).

2. Analyze opportunities for strategic misrepresentation: Since the matching mechanism is a variation of S-DA, and crucially, Parent_B is unlikely to be affected by Part 2 (Blocking Parent rule) if they secure a stable match early, misrepresentation can be beneficial.

3. Targeting Rank 1 (Nursery_A): Parent_B has low priority (4th) at N_A. Parent_E (1st priority) eventually claims N_A in the stable outcome, making N_A virtually impossible to secure.

4. Targeting Rank 2 (Nursery_B): Parent_B has 2nd priority at N_B, only behind Parent_E. If Parent_E applies elsewhere initially, Parent_B can claim N_B immediately.

5. Strategy [B, A, C, D, E]: By listing N_B first, Parent_B applies to N_B in Round 1. Parent_E applies to N_C first (True preference).

I analyzed the stable matching outcome assuming all agents submit their true preferences. This process (including two iterations of blocking parent removal) results in Parent_C being matched with Nursery_B (Rank 1 choice).

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission: If Parent_D submits the true preference list [B, C, A, E, D], the initial DA outcome M(P_D) is N_C (2nd choice). However, after applying the blocking check and subsequent reruns (due to P_C and P_A blocking), the final stable matching M_final results in P_D matching with N_A (3rd choice).

By submitting the manipulated list [C, B, A, E, D], Parent_D achieves the following sequence:

a. Initial DA Run (M*): P_D applies to N_C and secures it temporarily. P_C secures N_B temporarily. P_C eventually matches N_D, making P_C a blocking parent at N_B.

b. Rerun 1 (M**): P_C waives N_B. In the Rerun, P_C applies to N_C and successfully claims the spot, rejecting P_D (P_C has higher priority at N_C than P_D). P_D is then rejected and applies to their second submitted choice, N_B. Since N_B is now vacant (P_C waived it) and P_A (the only other applicant in R1**) is rejected in R2**, P_D successfully secures N_B.

Since the standard DA mechanism is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side only when finding the parent-optimal stable matching, and given that D is a highly preferred choice, I analyzed if manipulation could lead to a better outcome than revealing true preferences.

1. True Preferences Baseline: If Parent_E submits true preferences ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'], the DA outcome yields a match with Nursery_A (3rd choice). This happens because Parent_D (who has higher priority at C) displaces E from C in Round 2, and Parent_B eventually matches with D, leaving E to settle for A.

2. Targeting Higher Choices: Nursery_C (1st choice) is difficult because Parent_D ranks C highly (2nd choice) and has higher priority than E at C. D secures C early in the process.

3. Targeting Nursery_D (2nd choice): D is the next best option. In the baseline run, D remained unmatched until R4, when Parent_B applied and was admitted. Since E has higher priority than B at D (E is 4th, B is 5th), E can secure D if E applies early.

4. Manipulation Test: Parent_E submits ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'].
   - Round 1: E applies to D and is temporarily admitted.
   - Round 2: Parent_D, rejected from B, applies to C and is admitted (displacing no one, as C was empty). D secures C.
   - Subsequent rounds: E holds D against later applicants (like B in R4). 

The resulting final allocation M' = {(A, A), (B, E), (C, B), (D, C), (E, D)} gives Parent_E a match with Nursery_D (2nd choice), which is better than the 3rd choice (A) achieved by submitting true preferences.

1. Initial Calculation (True Preferences Submitted):
I calculated the stable matching using the true preferences of all parents ('Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'). The result of Part 1 (Run 1) placed Parent_A at Nursery_E (Rank 4).

2. Part 2 Analysis:
This outcome generated blocking parents (P_A blocked A, P_C blocked B, P_D blocked C).

3. Strategic Decision:
Since the true preference list guarantees the Parent-Optimal Stable Match (POSM) for Parent_A, and this outcome is Rank 4 (Nursery_E), misrepresenting preferences to aim higher (B, C, or A) would fail due to the higher priority claims of Parent_E and Parent_D at Nursery_A, and Parent_B/C/D/E at Nursery_B and Nursery_C.

2. Blocking Parent Check (M):
I traced the temporary admissions for M. No parent whose temporary match caused rejection ended up moving to a different final match. Therefore, M is stable under the full mechanism, and D receives Nursery A.

5. Rerun DA:
The rerun DA process (with A removed from D's list) resulted in Parent D matching with Nursery D (5th choice), a significantly worse outcome.

In the stable matching S*, Parent_A temporarily held Nursery_A (R3) before ending up at E, causing Parent_B to be rejected. Parent_A became a blocking parent at A. This triggers Part 2, leading to multiple reruns where Parent_A's preference list is restricted (Nursery_A is removed).

3. Reruns and Final Outcome:
Even after the preference lists are restricted in subsequent reruns (P'_A = (B, C, E, D) and P''_A = (B, C, E, D)), the final stable matching remains the same: Parent_A is matched with Nursery_E. The dynamic preference changes dictated by Part 2 do not allow Parent_A to achieve a rank higher than 4th, as Parent_A has low priority (4th or 5th) at their top choices (B, C, A) compared to other parents.

In standard DA where the proposing side (Parents) seeks optimal outcomes, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy. I first calculated the stable matching outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences. 

1. Standard DA Calculation (Using True Preferences):
   The resulting match (M_Final) was: P_A -> N_E, P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_B, P_D -> N_C, P_E -> N_D.
   Parent D's outcome is N_C, which is Rank 2 on the True Preference List (TPL: B, C, A, E, D).

2. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_B):
   Parent D prefers N_B (Rank 1). However, N_B prioritizes P_E (1st), P_B (2nd), P_C (3rd), and P_D (4th). In the DA process, P_C proposes N_B first and secures the spot against P_D because P_C has higher priority and N_B is P_C's top choice. Since P_C matches N_B, P_C is not a blocking parent and N_B will not be waived from P_C's list.

3. Strategic Manipulation Check:
   Since N_B is unattainable due to priority barriers (P_C), the best achievable outcome is N_C (Rank 2). I tested submitting N_C first, which also resulted in a final match of N_C for P_D. Since no strategic misrepresentation can overcome the priority constraints and achieve Rank 1, submitting the true preference list ensures the highest possible stable outcome (Rank 2) under this mechanism. The Part 2 refinement does not enable Parent D to improve their outcome beyond what is achieved by submitting true preferences in this specific market configuration.",True,Nursery_B,False,True,1

In standard DAA, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents) to secure the Parent-Optimal Stable Matching (POSM).

1. Check if Parent_E can achieve their 1st choice, Nursery_C, by submitting true preferences (TPL).
   P_E's TPL is ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'].
   Nursery_C prioritizes P_D (3rd rank) over P_E (4th rank). Parent_D's 2nd choice is N_C. In the DAA run using TPL, P_E is temporarily admitted to N_C in R1, but rejected in R2 when P_D applies and is preferred by N_C. Since P_D cannot achieve a better school (N_B is prioritized for P_C), P_D will settle for N_C if possible. Thus, N_C cannot be achieved by P_E in any stable matching, as the pair (P_D, N_C) blocks it.

2. Determine the POSM outcome.
   The DAA simulation (Part 1) using TPL resulted in P_E matching N_D (2nd choice). The subsequent Part 2 modification (due to P_A and P_D being blocking parents) led to a final stable matching M' = {(A, E), (B, A), (C, B), (D, C), (E, D)}. P_E's final match is N_D, their 2nd choice.

3. Assess strategic manipulation.
   Since N_D is the best achievable outcome (N_C is unstable for P_E), and DAA is generally strategy-proof for the proposing side, any attempt to manipulate the list (e.g., swapping N_C and N_D, or moving N_D down) is unlikely to improve the outcome and risks leading to a worse match (as demonstrated when testing L_2, resulting in N_A, P_E's 3rd choice).

First, I determined the final stable matching M generated by the standard DA process using the true preferences of all agents, which resulted in Parent_A being matched with N_E (Rank 4).

M = {(A, N_E), (B, N_B), (C, N_C), (D, N_A), (E, N_D)}.

Next, I analyzed the impact of the Part 2 mechanism on this outcome. The Part 2 process led to iterative modifications of parents' lists (specifically P_A, P_D, P_C, P_E) because temporary admissions caused rejections but did not lead to a final match for the temporarily admitted parent. After several reruns, the final stable outcome converged to Parent_A being matched with N_E (Rank 4).

Since Parent_A cannot displace higher priority parents (P_C, P_D) from their preferred nurseries (N_B, N_C, N_A), and attempts to strategically misreport preferences (e.g., swapping R1/R2, or proposing N_A first) did not lead to a better outcome that survived the Part 2 iterative removals, the optimal strategy remains submitting the full, true preference list.

Part 2 of the mechanism automatically modifies the CRLs of these blocking parents and reruns the allocation. When the process was rerun based on Parent_B submitting the TPL, the final stable outcome resulted in Parent_B matching with Nursery_A (Rank 1).

Parent_D is rejected from its first choice (N_B) by Parent_C in Round 1, leading P_D to apply to N_C in Round 2. If P_E applies in R1, P_D replaces P_E in R2. If P_E applies later, N_C is already taken by P_D. Rank 1 appears unattainable.

3. Attempt Manipulation for Rank 2 (N_D): I tested submitting P_E' = [D, C, A, E, B] (swapping Rank 1 and 2).
   - R1: P_E -> D. P_E temporarily admitted (E, D). P_D -> B (rejected). P_C admitted at N_B.
   - R2: P_D -> C. P_D admitted at N_C.
   - Later rounds confirmed P_E remains matched to N_D because P_D and P_B (who applies later) have lower priority than P_E at N_D.
   - Final outcome of Part 1 (M0): (P_E, N_D). Rank 2 achieved.

4. Check Part 2 (Blocking Parents): The definition requires a parent P to cause rejections AND move to a different final match. In the M0 outcome derived from P_E', every parent who caused a rejection (P_C, P_D, P_A, P_E) ended up matched to the same nursery where they caused the rejection. Thus, there are no blocking parents, and M0 is the final outcome.

1. **Analyze Priority Constraints for Top Choices:**
   - Nursery B (Rank 1): Parent A (5th priority) is outranked by Parent C (3rd) and Parent D (4th), who both apply to B in Round 1. A cannot secure N_B.
   - Nursery C (Rank 2): Parent C applies to N_B first. Parent E applies to N_C first. Parent A is 5th priority at N_C. N_C accepts E or D (both higher priority than A) early in the process. A cannot secure N_C.
   - Nursery A (Rank 3): Parent B applies to N_A first. Parent A is 3rd priority, but Parent D (2nd priority) applies later and displaces A if A is temporarily admitted.

2. **Simulate True Preference Submission:** When Parent_A submits the true list ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the DA process leads to a matching M1 where A is matched with N_E (Rank 4).

1. Initial Analysis (True Preferences: [B, C, A, E, D]): Running Part 1 yields D matching C (2nd choice).

2. Analyze Strategic Misreporting (Swapping Ranks 1 and 2): Parent_E's desired Rank 2 is N_D. N_D is a highly desirable school for Parent_E, and Parent_E has moderate priority there (4th). By submitting [N_D, N_C, N_A, N_E, N_B]:

3. Part 2 Analysis (Truthful Submission): Since P_A was temporarily admitted at N_A (R3) but ended up at N_E (F1), P_A is identified as a blocking parent at N_A. This triggers a rerun (F2), but P_A's final assignment remains N_E (4th preference).
4. Strategic Consideration: Attempting to rank N_E higher (e.g., B, C, E, A, D) successfully avoids triggering Part 2 but still results in the same final outcome for P_A (N_E, 4th preference), as higher preferences (B, C, A) are unattainable due to priority constraints. Attempting other strategies resulted in worse outcomes (N_D, 5th preference).

1. **Execution of Part 1 (Truthful Submission):** If Parent_D submits their true list ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the resulting stable matching (M) is calculated as: (P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_D), (P_C, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_A). Parent_D achieves a match with N_C, which is Rank 2 on their list.

2. **Analysis for Rank 1 (N_B):** N_B is matched with P_C. Since N_B prioritizes P_C (Rank 3) over P_D (Rank 4), P_D cannot obtain N_B as long as P_C submits N_B as a top choice, regardless of P_D's submission strategy.

3. **Manipulation Check:** Attempting to rank N_C first to avoid competition at N_B in Round 1 (e.g., [N_C, N_B, N_A, ...]) leads to Parent_D eventually matching with N_A (Rank 3), which is worse than N_C (Rank 2).

4. **Part 2 Check:** In the stable outcome M derived from truthful submissions, every parent who was temporarily admitted and caused a rejection (P_C at N_B, P_D at N_C, P_E at N_A) ended up staying at that nursery. Thus, the 'Discrepancy' condition is not met, and there are no blocking parents. The matching M is final.

1. Standard DA Analysis (Submitting True Preferences T_E = [C, D, A, E, B]): Running the Deferred Acceptance algorithm with true preferences resulted in Parent_E matching with Nursery_A (Rank 3). This outcome was stable (no blocking parents found in Part 2).

2. Strategic Analysis for Improvement:
   - Rank 1 (Nursery_C): Parent_E has 4th priority at N_C, significantly lower than Parent_D (3rd priority), who secured N_C in the DA outcome. P_E cannot displace P_D, nor can P_E easily influence P_D to take N_B (P_D's 1st choice, lost to P_C).
   - Rank 2 (Nursery_D): Parent_E has 4th priority at N_D. N_D was only filled late in the standard DA run (R4 by P_B). If P_E applies to N_D first, P_E might secure it.

3. Strategic Submission S_E = [D, C, A, E, B]: By prioritizing N_D (Rank 2) over N_C (Rank 1):
   - Round 1: P_E applies to N_D and is immediately accepted (TA), as N_D receives no higher priority applicants.
   - P_D is rejected from N_B (by P_C) and applies to N_C (R2), securing it against P_A (P_D has higher priority than P_E at N_C, but P_E is not competing there).
   - P_E holds N_D throughout the process. In R4, P_B attempts to displace P_E from N_D but fails (P_E has higher priority than P_B at N_D).

4. Final Outcome & Robustness: The resulting allocation yields M'(E) = Nursery_D (Rank 2).

First, I simulated the DA process assuming all parents submit their true preferences (truthful submission).

Initial Simulation (Truthful Submission):
Round 1 results in Parent_A being rejected by N_B. Parent_A eventually applies to N_E in Round 4 and is accepted.
Final Outcome (Truthful): A -> E (Rank 4).

Crucially, this resulting matching was found to have no 'blocking parents' (Part 2 check confirmed that every parent who temporarily caused a rejection eventually finalized their match at that same nursery). Therefore, the procedure ends after Part 1, and the outcome A -> E is final.

I tested alternative strategic submissions (e.g., submitting A first, or C first) and found that Parent_A still resulted in matching with N_E (Rank 4) or worse (N_D, Rank 5), sometimes causing complex blocking parent scenarios for others but never improving A's outcome.

I must verify if the addition of Part 2 maintains or improves this outcome for Parent_B when submitting true preferences.

1. Initial Run (Submitting True Preferences: [A, B, C, D, E]): The standard DA process leads to the temporary stable match M = {(P_E, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_C, N_D), (P_A, N_E)}. Parent_B gets N_B (2nd choice).

3. Rerun (P_A waives N_A): The DA process is rerun with P_A's modified list. In this new run, P_B is able to secure N_A in Round 1 because P_A applies to N_B instead. The final stable match M' is {(P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_D), (P_A, N_E)}. Parent_B achieves N_A (1st choice).

4. Check securing N_C: If P_D is rejected by N_B, P_D proposes to N_C in Round 2. In the truthful DA simulation, P_D wins N_C against competing applicants (P_A, P_E) due to higher priority at N_C (P_D is 3rd, P_E is 4th, P_A is 5th). P_D secures N_C (Rank 2).

Analysis of Truthful Submission (P_E: [C, D, A, E, B]):
1. Part 1 (Initial DA): The temporary stable matching $M_{truth}$ results in P_E matching with N_A (3rd choice). Crucially, P_E is rejected by N_C in Round 2 because Parent_D (higher priority at N_C) applies and is accepted.

In $M_1$, Parent_E matches with Nursery_D, which is the 2nd choice on P_E's true list. Since N_C (1st choice) is unreachable because Parent_D has higher priority and claims the spot in the initial rounds of DA, N_D (2nd choice) is the optimal outcome achievable under truthful reporting.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission): If Parent_A submits the True Preference List (B, C, A, E, D), the P-DA algorithm (Run 1) results in P_A matching with N_E (Rank 4). This allocation is stable relative to the true preferences.

1. Run DA assuming truthful submission (M1):
   The stable match M1 results in Parent_B being matched with Nursery_B (2nd choice).

2. Analyze Blocking Parents in M1:
   In Round 3 of M1, Parent_A was temporarily admitted to Nursery_A (N_A prefers P_A over P_B) and rejected Parent_B. However, Parent_A eventually matched with Nursery_E (N_A != N_E). Since P_A's temporary admission caused P_B's rejection, P_A is identified as a Blocking Parent at N_A.

3. Rerun DA after list modification (M2):
   Part 2 forces Parent_A to remove N_A from their list. When the DA algorithm runs again with the modified lists, Parent_B applies to N_A in Round 1.

1. Analyze True Preferences (B, C, A, E, D):

4. Rerun DA (Part 1) with P_A's waiver:
   - This rerun leads to a new final stable matching (M_DA_2) where P_D is matched with N_C (2nd choice), P_B gets N_A, and P_C gets N_B. This outcome is highly favorable for P_D (Rank 2).

5. Test Deviation:

   - E's temporary admission at C (R1) caused no rejections as E was the only applicant. E was later rejected from C.

I first simulated the P-DA process (Part 1) using the true preferences of all agents:
1. Round 1: P_A applies to N_B, rejected by P_C. P_D also rejected.
2. Round 2: P_A applies to N_C, rejected by P_D. P_E also rejected.
3. Round 3: P_A applies to N_A. N_A holds P_B. P_A beats P_B (P_A priority 3 vs P_B priority 4 at N_A). P_A temporarily admitted to N_A. P_B rejected. P_E applies to N_D and is admitted.
4. Round 4/5: P_B is rejected and eventually matches N_E.

The resulting stable matching M_DA is: (P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_D). Parent_A is matched with N_A, which is their 3rd choice.

Since this outcome is stable, the subsequent check for blocking parents (Part 2) confirms that no parent who temporarily displaced another ultimately moves away.

My goal is to maximize the rank of the final match.

1. Analyze the outcome if Parent B submits true preferences (Scenario 1):
   The stable matching (M1) yields B matched with N_D (Rank 4). This happens because Parent E has higher priority (Rank 1) than Parent B (Rank 4) at N_A. Parent B is rejected by N_A in Round 3 and ends up proposing to N_D in Round 4, securing Rank 4.

2. Analyze the feasibility of N_A (Rank 1):
   Since N_A prioritizes Parent E over Parent B (E > B), Parent B cannot secure N_A if E proposes to it, which E inevitably does if rejected by its higher choices (N_C, N_D).

3. Analyze the feasibility of N_B (Rank 2):
   N_B prioritizes Parent B over Parent C, D, and A (E > B > C > D > A). If Parent B submits N_B as Rank 1 (Scenario 2), B proposes to N_B in Round 1 along with A, C, and D. Since B has the highest priority among these applicants, B secures N_B immediately.

4. Simulation of Scenario 2: B submits ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'].
   R1: N_B admits B, rejecting A, C, D. N_C admits E.
   R2: Rejected A, C, D propose N_C. N_C admits C (C > D > E > A), rejecting A, D, E.

   Final Matching (M2): (A, E), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, A). Parent B is matched with N_B (Rank 2).

5. Part 2 check:
   In M2, all temporary admissions that caused rejections (B at N_B, C at N_C, E at N_A, A at N_E) resulted in final admissions at the same nursery. Therefore, no blocking parents are found, and M2 is the final outcome.

While standard DA is strategy-proof, the adjustment phase means that submitting the true preference list (TPL) might lead to a suboptimal outcome if the temporary matches created by the TPL trigger a chain reaction of waivers that ultimately push Parent_C lower on their list.

Parent_C's TPL is ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A'].

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_B): Nursery_B prefers Parent_B (Rank 2) over Parent_C (Rank 3). Parent_B proposes to Nursery_A first, but is likely to be rejected by Nursery_A (due to higher priority parents P_D or P_A proposing there). Once rejected, Parent_B proposes to Nursery_B, displacing Parent_C. Therefore, Parent_C cannot stably achieve N_B.

2. Submitting TPL ['B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'A']: Initial run yields P_C -> N_B. However, P_D becomes a blocking parent (at N_C), forcing a rerun. This rerun results in P_B displacing P_C at N_B, and P_C becomes a blocking parent (at N_B), forcing a second rerun. The final outcome after all adjustments is P_C -> N_D (Rank 3).

3. Strategic Submission ['C', 'B', 'D', 'E', 'A']: By prioritizing Nursery_C (Rank 2 TPL), Parent_C avoids the initial R1 temporary match at N_B that caused the blocking sequence. Running the process with this list:
    a. Initial R1: P_C secures N_C (P_C has higher priority than P_E, the only other candidate). 
    b. Later rounds see P_B proposing to N_C and displacing P_C (since N_C prefers P_B). P_C then proposes to N_B and secures it against P_D. The initial stable matching (M0) is P_C -> N_B (Rank 1 TPL).
    c. Crucially, the Part 2 check identifies P_A as the latest blocking parent (at N_A). P_A waives N_A. 
    d. Rerun 1 (with P_A's waiver): P_B remains matched at N_A throughout, as P_A does not propose N_A. P_C remains matched at N_C throughout.

1. Analyze the feasibility of Rank 1 (Nursery_B): Parent_D (Priority 4 at N_B) proposes N_B in Round 1. However, Parent_C (Priority 3) also proposes N_B and has higher priority, securing the seat. Thus, Rank 1 is unreachable.

2. Analyze Truthtelling (Submitting True Preferences): When Parent_D submits ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the initial stable matching (M_S) yields N_A (Rank 3). Subsequent application of Part 2, which modifies P_A's list and then P_B's list based on blocking behavior, ultimately leads to a final stable matching (M_F) where Parent_D is matched to N_C (Rank 2). This is the best achievable rank.

3. Analyze Manipulation: Testing a manipulation (e.g., submitting N_C first) resulted in a final stable matching where Parent_D was matched to N_A (Rank 3), which is worse than the Rank 2 achieved by truthtelling.

Since the complexity introduced by Part 2 does not seem to break the strategy-proof nature of the DA mechanism for Parent_D in this specific case, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy to secure the Rank 2 outcome (Nursery_C).",True,Nursery_A,True,False,3

P_E was rejected from N_C (Rank 1) by Parent_D and later rejected from N_D (Rank 2) by Parent_C.

3. Parent_D was matched to N_C, which P_E could not prevent due to N_C's preference for P_D.

Parent_A has 3rd priority at A, losing only to P_E (1st) and P_D (2nd). In the standard Deferred Acceptance (DA) outcome using sincere preferences, P_D ultimately secures A, leaving P_A unable to secure Rank 3.
2. Sincere DA Outcome: Running DA with sincere preferences results in the stable match M_Sincere, where Parent_A is matched with Nursery_E (Rank 4).
3. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2): Although M_Sincere is stable, the initial DA run (Part 1) shows Parent_A is a 'blocking parent' at Nursery_A (temporarily admitted in R3, causing P_B's rejection, but eventually moving to E). This forces the mechanism to waive A from Parent_A's list in a Rerun, leading to the same final match P_A $	o$ E.
4. Strategy: Since Parent_A cannot achieve a rank higher than E (Rank 4), and the DA mechanism is designed to find the P-optimal stable match, submitting the true preference list ensures the highest attainable outcome.

Parent_B's True Preference List (T) is ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'].

1. Analysis of True Preferences: If Parent_B submits T, the P-DA simulation yields a final match M where Parent_B is matched to N_D (Rank 4).

2. Strategic Submission ([B, A, C, D, E]): Simulation of Part 1 yields a temporary match N_A (in R2), but a final match N_C (3rd choice). N_C is preferred over N_D. P_B is still identified as a blocking parent at N_A, leading to the removal of N_A.

Since the strategic list [B, A, C, D, E] results in a better match (N_C) in the initial DA run compared to the honest list (N_D), and the subsequent automatic list modification (removal of N_A) is identical in both scenarios, leading to the same final stable assignment (N_C), the strategic submission is optimal. Submitting N_B first allows Parent_B to bypass the highly competitive N_A initially, securing the better outcome N_C, which is the highest achievable stable match for Parent_B in this market.",False,Nursery_B,True,False,2

1. Initial DA run resulted in Parent_C matching with N_B (Rank 1).
2. This outcome (P_C -> N_B) was maintained throughout the subsequent blocking checks and reruns, as P_C never became a blocking parent (P_C's temporary admission at N_B was also their final admission).

I analyzed the outcome when Parent D submits the TPL: ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'].

1. Initial DA (M0): D matches to Nursery A (Rank 3). D is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery C (Rank 2), and Parent A is blocking at Nursery A.

1. True Preference Simulation: If Parent_E submits the true list, the outcome is N_A (3rd choice). Parent_E fails to get N_C (1st choice) because Parent_D has higher priority at N_C and applies there in Round 2.

2. Attempting N_C (1st choice): Parent_E cannot secure N_C as Parent_D's priority at N_C (Rank 3) is higher than Parent_E's (Rank 4). Parent_E cannot manipulate other parents' applications to divert Parent_D away from N_C.

3. Attempting N_D (2nd choice): Parent_E can achieve N_D by submitting it as the first choice. Since no other parent applies to N_D in Round 1 (based on their true preferences), Parent_E secures the spot immediately. When Parent_B applies to N_D later (Round 4), Parent_E maintains the seat because Parent_E (Rank 4) has higher priority at N_D than Parent_B (Rank 5). This manipulation yields a match at N_D (2nd choice), which is better than the N_A outcome (3rd choice) achieved with true preferences.

4. Blocking Parent Check: The resulting match (P_E matched with N_D) must be checked for blocking parents. The DA simulation using the manipulated list shows that no parent satisfies both the 'Prevention' (causing rejection) and 'Discrepancy' (moving elsewhere) criteria simultaneously. Thus, the outcome M' is final.

Simulating the full process (Part 1 + Part 2 iterations) using Parent_A's true preferences reveals the following:
1. Initial P-DA (Part 1) outcome: P_A matches with N_E (Rank 4).

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission): If Parent_E submits their true preference list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'], the Parent-Proposing DA algorithm yields the stable matching M = {(P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_C), (P_E, N_A)}. Parent_E is matched with N_A (3rd choice). This matching M is stable and contains no blocking parents, so it is the final outcome under truthful submission.

2. Strategic Analysis: Parent_E seeks to achieve N_C (1st) or N_D (2nd). If P_E applies to N_C first (truthfully), P_E is rejected in Round 2 when Parent_D (higher priority at N_C) applies. If P_E swaps their top two choices and applies to N_D first: P_E submits ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'].

3. Strategic DA Run: In this scenario, P_E applies to N_D in R1 and is temporarily admitted. Crucially, Parent_D (who has the highest priority at N_D) applies to N_B and N_C first, and secures N_C in R2. Since P_D never applies to N_D (their 5th choice), P_E remains matched with N_D.

If Parent D submits their true list, the stable matching (M) results in D being assigned to Nursery A (Rank 3). This occurs because D is rejected by N_B in R1 (due to lower priority than P_C) and eventually displaced from N_C (by P_C) before securing N_A.

2. Analysis of Strategic Misreporting (Swapping N_B and N_C):
If Parent D submits ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', ...], they propose to N_C in R1. 
- In R1, N_C receives proposals from P_D and P_E. N_C prefers P_D (Rank 3) over P_E (Rank 4). P_D is admitted to N_C.
- By avoiding N_B in R1, P_D allows P_C to temporarily secure N_B. Later, P_B displaces P_C from N_B. P_C eventually moves to N_D. P_B secures N_A and then N_B.

1. Standard DAA Outcome (True Preferences submitted):
When all parents submit their true preferences, the stable matching results in Parent_E being matched with Nursery_A (Rank 3). Parent_E initially applies to N_C, is temporarily accepted, but is displaced in Round 2 by Parent_D (who has higher priority at N_C).

2. Targeting Rank 1 (Nursery_C):
Parent_E is 4th priority at N_C. Since Parent_D (3rd priority) and Parent_C (2nd priority) both prefer N_C highly and apply early, it is highly unlikely P_E can secure N_C without manipulating the entire market structure, which is not feasible given the constraints.

3. Targeting Rank 2 (Nursery_D):
I tested a manipulation strategy (S_D) where Parent_E submits N_D as their first choice, followed by the rest of the true preference order: [N_D, N_C, N_A, N_E, N_B].

Simulation of S_D (Part 1):
- R1: P_E applies to N_D and is provisionally accepted (TA N_D). P_B applies to N_A and is accepted (TA N_A). P_C applies to N_B and is accepted (TA N_B), rejecting P_A and P_D.
- R2: P_D applies to N_C and is accepted (TA N_C). P_A is rejected from N_C.
- R3/R4: Remaining parents (P_A, P_B) are matched to N_E and N_A respectively.

Final Matching (S_D): P_E -> N_D (Rank 2). This is an improvement over the Rank 3 outcome from submitting true preferences.

Specifically, Parent_C (P_C) has higher priority than Parent_D (P_D) at N_C (P_C is 2nd, P_D is 3rd). If P_C applies to N_C, P_D will be rejected. P_C only applies to N_C if rejected from N_B. This rejection chain is initiated by P_E applying to N_A, displacing P_B, who then displaces P_C at N_B.

To secure N_C (Rank 2), P_D needs to prevent P_C from applying there, or ensure P_C is matched to N_B. Since P_D cannot displace P_C at N_C, P_D must ensure P_C is matched elsewhere.

1. Part 1 (DA run with true preferences): Parent_A attempts N_B, N_C, N_A, and is rejected due to higher priority parents (P_C, P_D, P_B, P_E). Parent_A eventually matches with N_E (4th choice) in Round 6, where Parent_A holds the highest priority.

   Based on the strict definition provided, a parent P is blocking at N if P was temporarily admitted at N, AND this temporary admission CAUSED other rejections, AND P eventually moved away from N. In M1, Parent C secured N_B in R1 and did not move, so C is not blocking.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission $T_D$ = ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D']): The process leads to a sequence of reruns where Parent D's list is reduced (first losing C, then A) and D's final stable match stabilizes at Nursery D (D's 5th choice).

However, this match configuration was highly unstable under Part 2 rules, triggering list reductions for D and others, which ultimately led to the same poor outcome $D \rightarrow D$.

This confirms that Parent_E's optimal strategy remains submitting their true preferences, as any manipulation would not improve the outcome, and could potentially worsen it if the resulting match were not stable or less preferred than the outcome achieved with truth-telling.

The introduction of Part 2 complicates this, as strategic deviation might change the history of temporary matches, thereby altering the waivers applied to other parents, which could potentially improve or worsen P_A's final outcome.

1. **Analyze Truthful Submission:** Submitting the true list ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'] results in the stable matching M_1, where Parent_A is matched to Nursery_E (Rank 4).

2. **Analyze Part 2 for Truthful Submission:** M_1 generates blocking parents (P_A at N_A, P_D at N_C). The system forces P_A to waive N_A and reruns DA (M_2). M_2 also results in P_A matched to N_E (Rank 4), and M_2 is stable with no blocking parents. Thus, the final outcome for truthful submission is N_E (Rank 4).

4. Final Outcome: Parent_C achieved a match with N_B, which is their 1st choice. Since Parent_C obtained their absolute top preference, no strategic misrepresentation could yield a better result. Furthermore, this final allocation contained no blocking parents, confirming stability.

1. Initial Simulation (True Preferences): I first simulated the process assuming all parents submit their true preferences. In the standard stable matching (M*), Parent_D matched with N_A (3rd choice).

2. Blocking Parent Check: I analyzed the temporary admissions and rejections in M. In all instances where a parent P's temporary admission caused a rejection, P remained matched to that nursery in the final outcome M (e.g., C at B, D at C, E at A). Therefore, the 'Discrepancy' condition (P moves away from N) is never met. No blocking parents are identified. 
3. Conclusion: The outcome M is the final outcome when all parents submit true preferences. Since M is the Parent-optimal stable matching, Parent_A cannot achieve a better outcome (N_B, N_C, or N_A) through standard DA manipulation.

Since Parent_A has low priority at their top choices (Prio 5 at B/C, Prio 3 at A), any attempt to manipulate preferences to trigger the blocking parent mechanism (Part 2) risks worsening A's outcome while likely benefiting higher-priority rivals by freeing up their desired seats (as demonstrated in test runs).

2. Part 2 check identifies P_D as blocking at N_C (along with others). P_A's list is modified.
3. Rerun DA (Part 1, Rerun 1): Parent D matches with N_C (Rank 2).
4. Part 2 check finds no further blocking parents. The process ends.

1. Identify the optimal stable match for Parent_E using true preferences: Simulation (Rerun 3, after all necessary waivers were applied) showed Parent_E matched with Nursery_D (Rank 2 on the true list: ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', ...]).
2. Check if Rank 1 (Nursery_C) is possible: P_E is ranked 4th at N_C, behind P_B, P_C, and P_D. Since P_C is highly ranked (2nd) and ultimately matched with N_C in the stable outcome, N_C is unavailable to P_E.

1. Initial Run (True List: [B, C, A, E, D]): The DA process resulted in (P_A, N_A), Rank 3. However, P_C was identified as a blocking parent at N_B, triggering a list modification for P_C (Part 2).
2. Rerun 1: P_A ended up with (P_A, N_E), Rank 4. P_A was identified as a blocking parent at N_A (temporarily admitted, then rejected by P_D, moving to N_E), triggering a list modification for P_A (removal of N_A).
3. Rerun 2 (P_A's effective list: [B, C, E, D]): The final outcome was (P_A, N_E), Rank 4, with no blocking parents found.

Analysis shows that P_A cannot achieve a match higher than N_E (Rank 4) because higher ranked options (N_B, N_C, N_A) are consistently secured by parents (P_D, P_B, P_C) who hold higher priority at those nurseries.

1. Baseline Simulation (True Preferences: A, B, C, D, E): If I submit my true preferences, the Deferred Acceptance (DA) process results in a match with N_D (Rank 4). This happens because Parent E (Rank 1 priority at N_A) and Parent D (Rank 2 priority at N_A) eventually apply to N_A, displacing me.
2. Goal Analysis: N_A (Rank 1) is difficult to secure because Parent E has the highest priority there and prefers N_A over N_D/N_E. N_B (Rank 2) is highly feasible, as I hold the 2nd highest priority at N_B (after Parent E). Since Parent E prefers N_C and N_D over N_B, they will propose elsewhere first.
3. Strategic Manipulation: By proposing N_B first: L'B = (B, A, C, D, E).
   - Round 1: I apply to N_B, along with P_A, P_C, P_D. Since I have 2nd priority (B > C > D > A) at N_B, I secure the temporary admission.
   - This early acceptance to N_B redirects P_C (who would have secured N_B in the true preference scenario) to N_C, displacing P_E. P_E is then diverted to N_D, and P_D is diverted to N_A.
4. Final Outcome: This strategic submission leads to the stable allocation where Parent B is matched to N_B (Rank 2). This is the best achievable outcome, as N_A remains blocked by higher priority parents (P_D in this scenario, or P_E in the true preference scenario).

A key property of DA is that submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing agents (the Parents), guaranteeing the best possible stable match for them. 

I first simulated the DA process assuming all parents submit their true preferences. Parent_C's outcome in Part 1 is a match with Nursery_B (Rank 1).

Part 2 involves checking for 'blocking Parents,' defined as those who were temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but whose final admission differed from that temporary assignment. In the stable matching resulting from DA (Part 1), I verified that every parent who was temporarily admitted and caused a rejection (i.e., won a competition in that round) maintained that assignment until the end of Part 1 (F=T). For instance, Parent_C was temporarily admitted at Nursery_B in Round 1, causing P_A and P_D to be rejected, and Parent_C's final assignment was N_B. Similarly, Parent_D at N_C (R2) and Parent_E at N_A (R3) maintained their spots. Parents who were displaced (like P_B at N_A or P_E at N_C in R1) did not cause rejections upon their initial temporary admission, thus failing Condition 1 for being a blocking parent.

The standard DA mechanism is strategy-proof for the proposing agents (Parents). Therefore, submitting the true preference list is generally the optimal strategy to secure the best stable outcome.

1. Identify the best attainable nursery: Parent_D's rank 1 choice is Nursery_B. However, Parent_C also prefers Nursery_B (Rank 1) and has higher priority (P_C is 3rd priority at N_B; P_D is 4th). Since P_C is matched with N_B in the final outcome when all submit true preferences (M1), N_B is unattainable for Parent_D.

2. Simulate DA with True Preferences: Submitting the true list ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'] initially results in a stable matching M where Parent_D is matched with N_A (Rank 3).

3. Apply Part 2 Cleanup: The cleanup phase forces Parent_A to waive N_A due to being a 'blocking Parent.' Rerunning the DA with this waiver (Rerun 1) results in a new stable matching M1 where Parent_D is matched with N_C (Rank 2). 

4. Conclusion: N_C (Rank 2) is the highest-ranked attainable nursery. Since submitting the true preference list yields this optimal outcome after the mechanism fully runs (Part 1 + Part 2), it is the optimal strategy.

1. Analyze the True Preference outcome: If all parents submit their true preferences, the initial Deferred Acceptance (DA) process (Part 1) results in Parent_E being matched with Nursery_D (Rank 2). Although this matching requires subsequent stabilization steps (Part 2) due to blocking parents (specifically P_E being a blocking parent in Rerun 1), the final outcome remains Nursery_D.

2. Analyze the attainability of Rank 1 (Nursery_C): Parent_E has lower priority (4th) at Nursery_C compared to Parent_D (3rd). Parent_D prefers Nursery_C (Rank 2) and is rejected from their Rank 1 choice (Nursery_B) by Parent_C. Therefore, Parent_D will always apply to Nursery_C and displace Parent_E if Parent_E applies first, making Nursery_C unattainable for Parent_E.

3. Optimal Strategy: Since Nursery_C is unattainable, the best outcome is Rank 2 (Nursery_D). If Parent_E reports their true preferences, they waste a round applying to Nursery_C only to be rejected, and this rejection structure leads to volatility requiring Part 2 reruns.

4. Strategic Misreporting: By swapping Rank 1 (Nursery_C) and Rank 2 (Nursery_D) in the submitted list, Parent_E submits ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B']. This strategy allows Parent_E to apply directly to Nursery_D in Round 1. Since Parent_E has sufficiently high priority at Nursery_D (4th, and only P_E applies initially), P_E secures N_D immediately.

1. Initial P-DA Simulation (All submit true preferences):
   The initial stable matching resulted in Parent_B matching with Nursery_B (Rank 2). Crucially, during the process (Round 3), Parent_A temporarily held Nursery_A, rejecting Parent_B, but Parent_A eventually matched elsewhere (Nursery_E).

2. Blocking Parent Analysis (Part 2):
   Parent_A is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_A because Parent_A's temporary admission prevented Parent_B (a lower priority applicant) from matching there, and Parent_A ultimately did not utilize the seat (Nursery_A) they blocked for others.

Since Parent C's goal is to match with the highest possible ranked nursery on their true preference list, we should submit the true preferences.

We simulate the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences:
1. Round 1: P_C applies to N_B. N_B receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D. N_B admits P_C (highest priority among applicants).

Parent C achieves a match with N_B, which is their 1st choice. Since this is the best possible outcome, misrepresenting preferences cannot improve the result.

1. Initial DA Simulation (using True Preferences): Parent_D applied to N_B (R1) but was rejected in favor of Parent_C (P_C has higher priority at N_B). The resulting stable matching (M*) was P_D -> N_C (True Rank 2).

2. Part 2 Analysis: In M*, Parent_C was identified as a blocking parent at N_B because P_C temporarily held N_B but ultimately moved to N_D. This caused N_B to be removed from P_C's list.

1. Analyze the True Preference List (TPL) Submission: If Parent_E submits their TPL ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'], the Part 1 stable matching (S) results in Parent_E matching with Nursery_A (3rd choice). 
2. Analyze Part 2 Correction (TPL submission): The run S generates blocking parents (P_A @ N_A and P_C @ N_B). After correcting the lists by removing N_A from P_A's list and rerunning DA, the new stable matching (S') results in Parent_E matching with Nursery_D (2nd choice). This matching S' has no blocking parents, so N_D is the final outcome.
3. Explore Strategic Misrepresentation: Nursery_C (1st choice) is highly unlikely to be achieved because Nursery_C ranks Parent_D (3rd priority) higher than Parent_E (4th priority). Since Parent_D is always rejected by their 1st choice (N_B takes P_C), P_D applies to N_C in Round 2 and displaces Parent_E, regardless of whether P_E applies to N_C or N_D first.
4. Test alternative list L1=['D', 'C', 'A', 'E', 'B']: If Parent_E submits L1, the Part 1 stable matching (S2) also results in Parent_E matching with N_A (3rd choice).
