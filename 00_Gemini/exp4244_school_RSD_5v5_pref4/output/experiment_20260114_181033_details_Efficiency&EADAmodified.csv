Student B's True Preference List (TPL) is ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'].

Strategic misrepresentation (e.g., ranking School A above School E) is beneficial only if School E is highly likely to be taken by someone called earlier, AND ranking A first secures A, which would otherwise be taken before B gets to it. 

Analysis shows that School D is the top choice for 4 out of 5 students (A, C, D, E) and will almost certainly be taken first. After D is taken, the remaining students pursue their #2 choices: Student E targets School E (B's #1), and Student A targets School A (B's #2).

If B is called early, reporting TPL (E > A) is strictly better, as B secures E. If B is called late, the competition for E and A is high. If B reports A > E, B secures A, but risks missing E even if E was available (because E might be taken later by E). If B reports E > A, and E is taken by Student E, B falls back to A.
