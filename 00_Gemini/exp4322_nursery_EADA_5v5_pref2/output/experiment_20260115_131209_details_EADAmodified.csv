1. **DA Simulation (True Preferences):** Parent A's top choice is Nursery E. However, Parent B also prefers Nursery E and has higher priority than Parent A at E (E prefers B > A). When both A and B propose E in Round 1, E accepts B, and A is rejected. In Round 2, A proposes to their second choice, Nursery B. Since Parent A has the highest priority at B, A is accepted by B. The resulting stable match for Parent A is Nursery B (Rank 2).
2. **Strategic Check:** Since Parent B's priority at E is insurmountable, Parent A cannot achieve their Rank 1 choice (E). The outcome (Nursery B) is the best stable outcome achievable for Parent A. Any attempt to manipulate the list risks missing out on Nursery B without securing E (as shown in simulations, manipulation leads to Rank 3 or worse).
3. **Part 2 Check:** The resulting stable matching (A->B, B->E, C->D, D->A, E->C) does not contain any 'blocking parents' because the temporary admissions leading to this final outcome are the final admissions themselves (or the parent who was temporarily admitted did not cause a rejection that benefited them only to move away later).

In standard DAA, submitting true preferences is the dominant strategy for parents, guaranteeing the best possible stable match for them. Since the goal is to maximize the rank of the resulting match, I will first test submitting the true preferences.

1. Execution of Part 1 (DAA) using True Preferences:
   - Round 1 proposals: A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C.
   - Decisions: N_E admits B (highest priority among A, B, D). N_C admits E. N_D admits C. Rejections: A, D.

   - Temporary Match (M_T): (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C).

2. Parent_B's outcome in M_T is N_E, which is Rank 1 on Parent_B's True Preference List.

   - Since no blocking parents are found, the match M_T is final.

1. Analysis of Top Choice (Nursery_E): N_E is highly contested. Parent_B lists N_E first and has a higher priority (R2) than Parent_D (R4) at N_E. Since Parent_B secures N_E immediately, N_E is unattainable for Parent_D.
2. Analysis of Second Choice (Nursery_A): N_A is the next best option. Parent_D has high priority at N_A (R2). Parent_B (R1) is occupied with N_E. Therefore, if Parent_D proposes to N_A, they will be accepted.

Since the standard DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents) with respect to the Parent-optimal stable matching, the first step is to determine the outcome assuming truthful reporting.

1. Standard DA (Part 1) Calculation using True Preferences:
   The resulting stable matching M is M = { (Parent_A, Nursery_B), (Parent_B, Nursery_E), (Parent_C, Nursery_D), (Parent_D, Nursery_A), (Parent_E, Nursery_C) }.
   Parent_A is matched with Nursery_B, which is Rank 2 on their True Preference List ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C'].

2. Stability and Uniqueness Check:
   A thorough check confirms that M is the unique stable matching for the given preferences and priorities. When the stable matching is unique, misreporting preferences cannot benefit any agent.

3. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2):
   In the execution of Part 1, no Parent was ever rejected after being temporarily admitted (since the process stabilized quickly and capacities are 1). Therefore, every temporary admission matched the final admission (M). Condition 2 for a blocking Parent ('temporary admission differs from the Parent's final admission') is never met. Thus, Part 2 does not trigger a rerun, and M is the final outcome.

Conclusion: Since the outcome is the unique stable matching, Parent_A cannot strategically manipulate their list to achieve a better match (i.e., Nursery_E). The best strategy is to submit the true preference list to guarantee the highest possible stable match for themselves, which is Nursery_B (Rank 2).",True,Nursery_B,True,True,2

1. Analyze the Stable Match (Part 1) based on True Preferences:
   - Parent A's top choice is Nursery E. However, Nursery E prioritizes Parent E (1st) and Parent B (2nd) over Parent A (3rd).
   - In Round 1, Parents A, B, and D propose to E. Since Parent E proposes to C, Parent B (Prio 2 at E) secures E. Parent A is rejected.
   - In Round 2, Parent A proposes to Nursery B (A's 2nd choice). Parent A has the highest priority (Prio 1) at B. A secures B.
   - The resulting stable match M(A) = B (Rank 2).

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents Check):
   - The match M is M(A)=B, M(B)=E, M(C)=D, M(D)=A, M(E)=C. 
   - We check if any parent was temporarily admitted (Prevention) but moved away (Discrepancy). 
   - Parent B was temporarily admitted at E in Step 1, causing A and D to be rejected, but B remained at E (No Discrepancy). 
   - No other temporary admissions caused rejections by parents who later moved away.

3. Strategic Consideration:
   - Since Parent B is guaranteed to secure E (being high priority and proposing E first), Parent A cannot achieve Rank 1 (Nursery E). 
   - Parent A's best possible outcome is Rank 2 (Nursery B). 
   - Submitting the truthful list ensures that A attempts E first, and upon rejection, secures B (where A is Prio 1).

Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger any list modifications or reruns.

3. Optimality:
   Nursery E (Parent A's Rank 1) prefers Parent B over Parent A (Priority: B > A). Since Parent B is matched to E and prefers E over any other achievable stable match, the pair (A, E) is blocked by B. Therefore, Nursery E is not achievable for Parent A in any stable matching.

1. Identify the POSM for Parent_D assuming all agents are truthful. Parent_D's priority at their top choice, Nursery_E, is 4th (behind P_E, P_B, P_A).

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents). In the truthful outcome, every temporary admission either caused no rejection or became the final match. Thus, no blocking parents are found, and the stable matching (P_D -> N_A) is the final outcome.

1. Calculate the outcome based on all agents submitting their True Preferences (TP):

2. Analysis of N_A (Rank 2): After rejection from N_E, Parent_D applies to N_A in Round 2. N_A receives P_D and accepts P_D (N_A priority for P_D is 2nd). This match is secured.

3. Part 2 Check: Since the resulting matching M = {(P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_A), (P_E, N_C)} is reached without any parent moving after their initial temporary acceptance in Part 1, no 'blocking parents' are identified. Part 2 does not trigger any list modifications.

4. Conclusion: Parent_D achieves a match with N_A, which is their second choice.

Round 1: A, B, D apply to E. E accepts B (Priority: B > A, D). A and D rejected. C applies to D (Accepted). E applies to C (Accepted).
Round 2: A applies to B (Accepted). D applies to A (Accepted).

Parent_A receives Nursery B (Rank 2).

Second, I considered Part 2, which eliminates 'blocking parents.' A parent P is blocking at N if they were temporarily admitted at N (causing others to be rejected) but their final match M(P) is different from N. In the standard DAA (Part 1), if the process converges, all temporary admissions held at the end become final admissions. No parent is ever rejected after receiving a temporary admission, as the process only stops when no parent is rejected.

1. Initial DAA Run (Part 1) using true preferences for all parents:

1. Simulation of Truthful Reporting (Part 1):

   - Parent_D is rejected from N_E in Round 1 and applies to N_A (Rank 2) in Round 2, where they are accepted (N_A ranks P_D second overall).
   - The resulting matching M1 is stable: M(P_D) = N_A (Rank 2).

2. Analysis of Part 2:
   - In M1, every parent who was temporarily admitted in Round 1 (P_B @ E, P_C @ D, P_E @ C) remained matched to that nursery in the final outcome of Part 1. Therefore, no parent meets the criteria of a 'blocking parent' (a temporary admission causing rejection, followed by a discrepancy in final admission).
   - Part 2 does not change the outcome M1.

3. Strategic Consideration:
   - Since P_D cannot overcome P_B's priority at N_E, and the truthful outcome M1 is stable and Parent-Optimal, any strategic misreporting (e.g., swapping N_E and N_A) risks delaying the application to N_A, potentially allowing another parent (like P_E) to secure N_A if they had applied there first, or simply resulting in the same outcome after more rounds.

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2):
   - In M, only Parent B caused rejections (A, D) when temporarily admitted at E in R1. Since B's final match is also E (M(B)=E), there is no discrepancy. B is not a blocking parent. No other temporary admission caused rejections or differed from the final match.

3. Conclusion: Since N_A is the outcome of the Parent-optimal stable matching, and Parent D cannot overcome the higher priority of P_B and P_A at their preferred choice N_E, N_A (Rank 2) is the best achievable outcome.

Since Parent_E's true preference list is ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], I will first calculate the stable matching assuming all parents submit their true preferences.

Part 1: Standard DA Calculation (Using True Preferences):
1. Round 1: P_E applies to N_C. N_C admits P_E. P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. N_E admits P_B (highest priority). P_A and P_D are rejected.

1. Initial Analysis (Part 1, assuming PPL submission by all):
   Parent A's true preferences are E(1), B(2), D(3), A(4), C(5).
   In Round 1, A applies to E but is rejected by Parent B (Prio 2 at E) who secures E. A is rejected. Parent C secures D, and Parent E secures C.

   The stable matching is M = {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}. Parent A receives Nursery B (2nd choice). Nurseries E, D, and A are blocked by higher priority parents (B, C, D respectively).

2. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2):
   In this outcome, the parents securing seats in R1 (B, C, E) secured their top choices and did not move (they were not rejected later). Since no parent moved away from a temporary admission after causing a rejection, no blocking parents are created. Part 2 does not change the outcome.

3. Strategic Consideration:
   Since the achieved outcome (B) is the P-OSM, standard manipulation cannot improve upon it. Furthermore, it is impossible to strategically induce movement (a parent leaving a temporary match for a preferred nursery) that benefits A, because Parent B, who blocks A from E, secures their top choice E and will not move voluntarily.

N_E's priority list dictates that P_B (Rank 2) is admitted over P_A (Rank 3) and P_D (Rank 4). P_D is rejected. In Round 2, P_D proposes to their second choice, N_A, and is admitted. The resulting matching M is: (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_A), (P_E, N_C). Parent_D is matched with N_A (Rank 2).
2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2): In this resulting matching M, no parent was temporarily admitted to a nursery only to move away later (due to the capacity of 1 and the specific priority ordering). Therefore, no blocking parents are found, and the procedure ends with M as the final outcome.
3. Optimality: Since N_E is secured by the higher-priority Parent_B, N_E is unreachable for Parent_D in any stable matching. N_A (Rank 2) is the best attainable outcome. Given the strategy-proof nature of PPDA and the confirmation that Part 2 does not alter the outcome when true lists are submitted, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

Part 2 removes a nursery N from Parent P's list if P used N as a 'stepping stone' (temporarily admitted, causing rejections) but ultimately matched elsewhere. Since this removal only affects nurseries that Parent E did not match with in the initial run (Part 1), it cannot improve Parent E's allocation beyond what the truthful submission achieves in Part 1.

Therefore, submitting the true preference list remains the optimal strategy for Parent E.

Round 1 Projections:
N_E receives P_A, P_B, P_D. N_E prefers P_B over P_A and P_D. P_B is admitted. P_A and P_D are rejected.
N_D admits P_C.

Parent_A is matched with N_B, which is their second choice.

Next, I considered Part 2 (Blocking Parents). A parent is a blocking parent only if their temporary admission caused a rejection, but their final admission differed (Discrepancy).

1. Calculate the DA outcome (Part 1) using Parent_A's True Preference List: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C'].
   - Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. N_E prefers P_B (2nd) > P_A (3rd) > P_D (4th). P_B is admitted. P_A and P_D are rejected.
   - Round 2: P_A applies to N_B (Rank 2). P_D applies to N_A (Rank 2). Both are admitted.
   - Final Match M: (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_A), (P_E, N_C). Parent_A achieves N_B (Rank 2).

2. Evaluate if a better outcome (N_E, Rank 1) is possible: N_E prioritizes P_B over P_A. P_A cannot secure N_E regardless of strategy.

3. Evaluate the refinement step (Part 2): This step only removes a nursery from a parent's list if that parent temporarily blocked someone but ultimately moved elsewhere. The calculated stable matching M does not contain any such 'blocking parents' because the parents who were temporarily admitted (P_B, P_C, P_E in R1, P_A, P_D in R2) all ended up matched to that same school (or subsequently improved their match, but none moved away from a school where they caused a rejection). Therefore, the final outcome remains M.

1. Execution of Part 1 (DA) with true preferences:

1. Analyze competition for Parent_D's top choice, Nursery_E (P_D's 1st choice): Competitors P_A and P_B also rank N_E first. At N_E, the priority order is P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D. Since P_B has higher priority than P_D and also ranks N_E first, P_B will secure N_E in Round 1 (assuming P_B submits truthfully), leaving N_E unreachable for P_D.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_D: E > A > B > D > C):
   - **Nursery E (Rank 1):** P_D has low priority (Rank 4) at N_E. P_B (Rank 2) and P_A (Rank 3) both prefer E and have higher priority. P_B will secure N_E in Round 1.
   - **Nursery A (Rank 2):** P_D has high priority (Rank 2) at N_A, second only to P_B. P_A is Rank 3. 
   - **Nursery B (Rank 3):** P_D has the lowest priority (Rank 5) at N_B. P_A (Rank 1) is highly likely to secure N_B.

2. Simulating Truthful Submission (E, A, B, D, C):
   - **R1:** P_A, P_B, P_D apply to E. P_B is accepted (highest priority). P_A and P_D are rejected. P_C->D, P_E->C are accepted.

   - N_B accepts P_A (P_A is Rank 1). 
   - N_A accepts P_D (P_B, Rank 1, is matched to E). P_D is the highest priority available applicant at A.

3. Outcome:** Parent_D is matched with Nursery A (Rank 2).

Since N_E is blocked by P_B's higher priority, and N_B is blocked by P_A's much higher priority, N_A (Rank 2) is the best attainable outcome for Parent_D.

Part 2 introduces a check for 'blocking parents' related to temporary admissions.

Parent_C applies to Nursery_D (Rank 1). Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_A, then Parent_C. Since Parent_A applies to N_E, N_D receives only P_C. P_C is tentatively admitted to N_D.

Other matches establish:
N_E receives P_A, P_B, P_D. P_B is highest priority and admitted. P_A and P_D are rejected.
N_C receives P_E. P_E is admitted.

Round 2:
P_A applies to N_B (Rank 2). P_D applies to N_A (Rank 2).
N_B admits P_A. N_A admits P_D.

Final Admissions after Part 1: (P_C, N_D). Parent_C achieves their Rank 1 choice.

1. Calculate the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (Truthful DA):

2. Analyze the impact of Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): A parent is a blocking parent if they were temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but then moved away.

2. Parent_B is matched to Nursery_E, which is their 1st choice. Since this is the highest possible outcome, deviation cannot improve the result.
3. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2): Parent_B was temporarily admitted to N_E and their final admission M(P_B) is also N_E. Since the temporary and final admissions are the same, Parent_B is not a blocking parent. The matching M is finalized.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E is the top choice for P_A, P_B, and P_D. P_E (highest priority at N_E) applies to N_C (Rank 1). This leaves P_A, P_B, P_D competing for N_E in Round 1. N_E's priorities are [P_E, P_B, P_A, P_D, P_C]. Since P_B (Priority 2) and P_A (Priority 3) both rank N_E highest, P_B will always secure N_E over P_D (Priority 4) in Round 1, assuming truthful reporting from competitors.
2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): After rejection from N_E, P_D moves to N_A. P_D has the 2nd highest priority at N_A (behind P_B). Since P_B is matched to N_E, P_D will secure N_A in Round 2 (in the truthful scenario).
3. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Parents): The standard DAA outcome achieved in Part 1 is the Parent-optimal stable matching. In this stable outcome, every parent's final admission (F) is equal to their last temporary admission (T). Therefore, the condition for a blocking parent (F(P) != T(P)) is not met, and Part 2 is inert. The mechanism reduces to standard DAA.
4. Conclusion: Since DAA is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents) when the stable matching is reached without triggering the complex Part 2 mechanisms, reporting the true preferences maximizes Parent_D's outcome (N_A, Rank 2). Any attempt to manipulate the list by placing N_A first only achieves N_A earlier but does not improve the rank, and risks missing N_A if P_D is rejected from N_A by P_B (though P_B applies to N_E). Therefore, truthful reporting is optimal.

1. Calculate the Stable Matching (Truthful Reporting):
If Parent A reports truthfully (E, B, D, A, C), the DAA process results in the stable matching M = {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}. Parent A is matched to Nursery B, which is Rank 2 on A's true preference list.

2. Check for Improvement:
Parent A prefers Nursery E (Rank 1). However, Nursery E prefers Parent B (2nd priority) over Parent A (3rd priority). Since Parent B ranks E first, B will always apply to E and be admitted over A in the truthful scenario, making E unattainable for A.

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
In the truthful stable matching M, every parent who received a temporary admission (TA) that rejected others remained at that nursery in the final match. Therefore, there is no discrepancy between TA and final admission, and no blocking parents are found. Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

4. Analyze Strategic Manipulation:
Any attempt by Parent A to manipulate the list (e.g., swapping B and D, or applying to a low-ranked school C first) either leads back to the same stable matching M after waivers are forced by Part 2, or leads to a worse, potentially unstable outcome where A is matched to D (Rank 3) or A (Rank 4), without triggering beneficial waivers from competitors (like B or E). Since A cannot break the stable pair (B, E) or overcome B's priority at E, the best attainable outcome remains Nursery B (Rank 2).

    * Round 1: Parent_D applies to N_E (1st choice). N_E receives applications from P_A, P_B, and P_D. P_B has higher priority than P_D at N_E (P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D). P_B is accepted, and P_D is rejected.
    * Round 2: Parent_D applies to N_A (2nd choice). N_A accepts P_D.
    * Final Match (Part 1): Parent_D matches with N_A (2nd choice).

2. Attainability Check: N_E is blocked by P_B, who applies for N_E (1st choice) and has higher priority than P_D. P_D cannot achieve N_E.

3. Part 2 Analysis: Since Parent_D was rejected from N_E and subsequently accepted by N_A without moving again, Parent_D is not a 'blocking parent' under the specified definition. Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger a list modification for Parent_D, and the outcome remains N_A.

Since N_A is the highest ranked attainable nursery for Parent_D, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy to guarantee the best possible outcome.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

Since I am Parent_E and my goal is to maximize my outcome based on my true preference list, I should first assume truthful reporting is optimal. 

1. **Part 1 Simulation (Truthful Reporting):** When all parents report truthfully, Parent_E proposes to N_C in Round 1. N_C admits P_E (since P_E is the only proposer, despite low priority). The resulting stable matching is M1 = { (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_A), (P_E, N_C) }. Parent_E is matched with N_C, which is Rank 1 on their list.
2. **Part 2 Analysis:** Since Parent_E achieved their rank 1 choice, no better outcome is possible. Furthermore, in the resulting matching M1, all temporary admissions in Part 1 were final admissions, meaning no 'blocking parents' are identified. Thus, Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

1. Standard DAA (Part 1): The DAA is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (parents). Submitting true preferences guarantees the parent-optimal stable matching relative to the submitted list. 

2. Stability Check (Part 2): The rules state that the waiver (removal of a nursery from the list due to being a blocking parent) 'will never change your final admission.' This means Parent_A's final outcome is determined solely by the stable matching achieved in Part 1 based on the list Parent_A submits, irrespective of subsequent reruns intended to improve other parents' outcomes. 

3. Optimal Strategy: Since the outcome is fixed by the DAA run on the submitted list, Parent_A must submit their true preferences to guarantee the best possible stable match according to their true ranking. 

If Parent_A submits their true preferences ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C'], the resulting stable matching (M) is (Parent_A, Nursery_B), which is Parent_A's 2nd choice.

First, I analyzed the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (truthful equilibrium):
Round 1: N_E receives applications from P_A, P_B, P_D. P_B is kept (highest priority). P_A, P_D rejected. P_C->N_D, P_E->N_C accepted.
Round 2: P_A->N_B accepted. P_D->N_A accepted.
Final Outcome (Part 1): P_B is matched with N_E (Rank 1).

Since this outcome is stable, no Parent satisfies the 'Discrepancy' condition of Part 2 (temporary admission differing from final admission). Therefore, Part 2 does not alter the assignment or introduce incentives to deviate from truth-telling. Submitting the true preference list, ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A'], guarantees the highest possible outcome, N_E (Rank 1).",True,Nursery_E,True,True,1

1. Initial Simulation (using True Preferences):
   If Parent_C submits the true list ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'], the resulting standard DA allocation is:
   P_A -> N_B, P_B -> N_E, P_C -> N_D, P_D -> N_A, P_E -> N_C.
   Parent_C secures N_D, which is Rank 1 on the true list.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   In the resulting stable matching, temporary admissions equaled final admissions for all parents (as the process concluded in two rounds with no rejections ongoing), meaning no blocking parents were found. The final outcome is the stable matching achieved in Part 1.

3. Conclusion:

1. **Analyze DAA (Part 1) using True Preferences (TPL):** We first determine the stable matching outcome when all parents submit their TPLs. Parent_D's TPL is ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'].
    * In Round 1, Parent_D applies to N_E. N_E also receives applications from Parent_A and Parent_B. N_E's priority list is P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D. Parent_B is the highest priority applicant and is admitted. Parent_D is rejected.
    * In Round 2, Parent_D applies to N_A (2nd choice). N_A admits Parent_D.
    * The final assignment is P_A->N_B, P_B->N_E, P_C->N_D, P_D->N_A, P_E->N_C. Parent_D achieves their 2nd preference, N_A.

2. **Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents):** A blocking parent is one who was temporarily admitted at a nursery but ultimately moved away (or remained unmatched). In the stable matching found above, every parent who was temporarily admitted stayed at that nursery until the end of Part 1 (e.g., P_B was admitted at N_E in R1 and stayed there; P_D was admitted at N_A in R2 and stayed there). Since the temporary admissions equaled the final admissions, no blocking parents are created. Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger any waivers or reruns.

3. **Conclusion on Strategy:** Since the mechanism resolves to the stable matching outcome of the standard DAA, and DAA is strategy-proof for the proposing side, Parent_D cannot achieve a better outcome than N_A (their 2nd choice) by misrepresenting their preferences.

Therefore, Parent_E's optimal strategy is simply to submit their True Preference List.

1. Simulation using True Preferences:

1. Analysis of N_E (Rank 1):
Parent_D prefers N_E first. However, N_E's priority list places Parent_E (1st), Parent_B (2nd), and Parent_A (3rd) ahead of Parent_D (4th). Since Parent_B and Parent_A also rank N_E first, N_E will receive proposals from P_A, P_B, and P_D in Round 1. N_E will provisionally match with P_B (highest priority applicant), rejecting P_A and P_D. Thus, N_E is unattainable for Parent_D.

2. Analysis of N_A (Rank 2):
If Parent_D submits the true list, they are rejected from N_E in R1 and propose to N_A in R2. In the truthful simulation, N_A is free in R1, and in R2, only P_D proposes to N_A (P_E is matched to N_C, P_A proposes to N_B). Parent_D successfully secures N_A in R2.

3. Stability and Part 2:
Since the DAA process (Part 1) results in a stable matching where Parent_D gets N_A (Rank 2), and P_B gets N_E, there is no opportunity for Parent_D to move to N_E, and the matching is final. No 'blocking parents' are created as the provisional matches are the final matches. Therefore, Part 2 does not lead to list modification or a change in outcome.

4. Optimal Strategy:
Since N_E is unobtainable, and N_A is the highest achievable rank, the best strategy is to submit the True Preference List: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'].

By simulating the truthful submission (Part 1):
1. Parent_E applies to N_C (Rank 1).
2. P_B (highest priority at N_C) applies to N_E. P_C (2nd highest applying competitor at N_C) applies to N_D.
3. N_C receives only P_E's application and admits P_E.
4. This match (P_E, N_C) is retained throughout Part 1, resulting in Parent_E matching with their 1st choice.

Since Parent_E achieves the highest possible rank (Rank 1), no strategic deviation can improve the outcome.

1. Run DA (Part 1) with True Preferences:
   P_A: E > B > D > A > C
   Round 1: A applies to E. N_E admits B (higher priority); A is rejected.

   Since DA is strategy-proof, Parent A cannot achieve a better stable match (Rank 1, Nursery E) by misrepresenting their preferences.

This match M is stable. Because the outcome is stable, no Parent was temporarily admitted at a nursery and then moved away, meaning the conditions for a 'blocking Parent' (Part 2) are not met. The procedure ends, and the match is final.

Since the truthful outcome (N_A, Rank 2) is the stable, Parent-optimal result under standard DA, and the complex rules of Part 2 do not modify the outcome when the truthful match is already stable, deviating from the true preferences is unlikely to improve the outcome and risks receiving a worse match (e.g., N_C, Rank 5, if N_C was listed first).

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents): A Parent P is a blocking parent at N if they were temporarily admitted at N (causing rejections) but later moved to a different final match (M_final(P) != N).

1. Simulation using True Preferences:
   Running the DAA with all agents submitting their true preferences results in the following stable matching: (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_E), (P_C, N_D), (P_D, N_A), (P_E, N_C).

   Since the DAA result yields a stable matching, and the temporary admissions (End of Part 1) are identical to the final admissions, the condition for a 'blocking Parent' (Discrepancy: temporary admission differs from final admission) is not met for any parent.

Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D propose to N_E. N_E prioritizes P_B (2nd) over P_A (3rd) and P_D (4th). P_B is T-admitted to N_E. P_C to N_D (T-admitted). P_E to N_C (T-admitted).
Round 2: P_A proposes to N_B (T-admitted). P_D proposes to N_A (T-admitted).

The final matching M1 is: (P_A, B), (P_B, E), (P_C, D), (P_D, A), (P_E, C). 

In this outcome, Parent_B is matched with Nursery_E, which is Parent_B's 1st choice. Since this is the optimal possible outcome, and the stability properties of DA ensure that lying cannot improve this result, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy. Furthermore, since M1 is stable and no parent moved away from their temporary match, no 'blocking parents' are identified in Part 2, making M1 the final result.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,1

The prompt explicitly states that the subsequent blocking parent correction (Part 2) 'will never change your final admission' but only potentially improve other parents' admissions. This confirms that the optimal strategy for Parent_D remains truthful reporting, as misrepresenting preferences cannot lead to a better outcome than the outcome achieved by the DA algorithm using the true preferences.

Calculating the outcome under truthful submission:

2. Parent_D proposes to 2nd choice, Nursery_A. Nursery_A accepts P_D, as P_D is the highest priority applicant among those available for N_A at that stage (P_D is 2nd overall priority at N_A, only behind P_B, who is matched to N_E).

Therefore, Part 2 does not modify any preference lists, and the match is final.

3. Analysis of Part 2: In the stable outcome found using true preferences, the parent who caused rejections (P_B at N_E) did not move away (S(P_B) = N_E). Therefore, no blocking parents are found, and Part 2 does not trigger a rerun or change the final stable allocation (P_A gets N_B).

   - In the resulting stable matching (P_A->N_B, P_B->N_E, P_C->N_D, P_D->N_A, P_E->N_C), the only parent who caused rejections while temporarily admitted was P_B (at N_E in R1). Since P_B's final admission is N_E, TA=FA. No blocking parents are found.

Since the stable outcome achieved by submitting the true list (N_B, Rank 2) cannot be improved upon by misrepresenting preferences in a strategy-proof mechanism like DAA, the optimal strategy for Parent_A is to submit their true preference list.",True,Nursery_B,True,True,2

For the proposing side (Parents), submitting true preferences is generally a dominant strategy in the standard DA algorithm, guaranteeing the best possible stable match (the Parent-optimal stable match).

1. Initial Analysis (Part 1, using True Preferences):
If Parent_B submits their true preferences ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A'], the Parent-Proposing DA algorithm stabilizes quickly.
Round 1 results in Parent_B being temporarily admitted to Nursery_E (their Rank 1 choice), rejecting Parent_A and Parent_D.
After subsequent rounds, the stable matching found is M1 = { (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C) }.
Parent_B is matched to Nursery_E, which is their Rank 1 preference.

2. Stability and Optimality:
Since Parent_B achieved their most preferred outcome (Rank 1), no strategy can yield a better result. 

3. Impact of Part 2 Modification:
We checked the temporary admissions in M1. Parent_B was temporarily admitted to E and finally admitted to E. Since the temporary and final admissions are the same, Parent_B is not a 'blocking Parent.' Since the standard DA yielded a stable match where Parent_B received their top choice, and the rules state that the automatic waiver (Part 2) will 'never change your final admission,' submitting the true preferences remains the optimal strategy.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,1

Since the goal is to achieve the highest possible rank on the True Preference List, submitting the true preferences is the baseline optimal strategy.

First, I simulate the P-P DA (Part 1) using Parent_C's true preferences: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].

Round 1: P_C applies to N_D. N_D admits P_C. P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E; N_E admits P_B (highest priority). P_E applies to N_C; N_C admits P_E. P_A and P_D are rejected.
Round 2: P_A applies to N_B. N_B admits P_A. P_D applies to N_A. N_A admits P_D.

End of Part 1 match: P_C is matched to N_D. This is Rank 1 on Parent_C's True Preference List.

Since Parent_C achieves their Rank 1 choice, no better outcome exists. Furthermore, Parent_C cannot be a 'blocking parent' at any nursery they were temporarily admitted to, because N_D is their top choice, meaning they would never move away from N_D to a preferred alternative (Condition 2 for blocking parent fails for the final match).

Standard DAA theory states that submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents) to secure the best possible stable match for themselves, assuming the mechanism ends after Part 1.

1. **Analyze True Preferences (Part 1 DAA):** Using the true preference lists for all agents, the resulting stable matching (M*) is calculated. Parent_D applies to N_E (1st choice) but is rejected by Parent_B (who has higher priority at N_E). Parent_D then applies to N_A (2nd choice) and is accepted. The stable outcome is (Parent_D, Nursery_A).

2. **Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents):** In the stable matching M*, every parent's temporary admission spot either caused no rejection or was their final assignment. Thus, no blocking parents are found, and the process terminates with M*. Parent_D secures their 2nd choice, N_A.

3. **Analyze Manipulation Potential:** Parent_D cannot achieve their 1st choice (N_E) because Parent_B has higher priority at N_E and also prefers N_E first. Any attempt to manipulate the list might cause the matching to shift to a worse outcome (e.g., N_B or N_C) or trigger Part 2, potentially leading to a rerun where Parent_D's effective choices are curtailed, resulting in a worse final match (as demonstrated in the simulation where manipulation led to N_B, Parent_D's 3rd choice).

We verify this by running the DA algorithm assuming all parents submit their true preferences. Parent_E's true preference list is ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'].

Final outcome: (E, C). Parent_E is matched with their 1st choice, Nursery_C. This is the optimal result.

1. Run DA using true preferences (assuming all other parents submit their true lists):
    *   Round 1: Parents A, B, D propose to Nursery E (Rank 1). Nursery E prioritizes Parent B > Parent A > Parent D. Parent B is temporarily admitted. Parents A and D are rejected. Parent C is admitted to Nursery D. Parent E is admitted to Nursery C.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): A blocking parent is one who caused a rejection (Prevention) but moved away from that nursery in the final match (Discrepancy). In M1, the only parent who caused rejections was Parent B (at N_E), but Parent B remained matched with N_E.

We analyzed the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences: Parent_E ultimately matches with Nursery_E (their 5th choice). 

We must consider if strategic misrepresentation could yield a better result, especially due to Part 2. Part 2 identifies a 'blocking parent' P who was temporarily admitted at N but later moved elsewhere. If P is identified, N is removed from P's list for a rerun. Since the rules explicitly state this waiver 'will never change your final admission but may improve other Parents' final admissions,' Parent_E should avoid being identified as a blocking parent, as this would eliminate preferred options from their list without improving their own outcome. 

Furthermore, attempts to manipulate the application order (e.g., proposing Nursery_E first) failed to secure a better match for Parent_E because higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) quickly claimed Parent_E's more preferred nurseries (C, A, D, B) in the subsequent rounds, regardless of Parent_E's initial proposal.

1. Baseline DAA Calculation (using true preferences for all agents):
   - Round 1: Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_D all apply to Nursery_E (their top choice). Nursery_E prioritizes Parent_B (2nd), then Parent_A (3rd), then Parent_D (4th). Parent_B is temporarily admitted. Parent_A and Parent_D are rejected.

1. Analyze the competition for my top choice, Nursery_E (N_E). N_E priorities: P_E (1), P_B (2), P_A (3), P_D (4). I am 4th priority.
2. Assuming all other parents submit truthfully:
    - P_E applies to N_C (Rank 1). P_E is secured at N_C, removing the highest priority competitor for N_E.
    - P_B applies to N_E (Rank 1). P_B has higher priority (2nd) than me (4th) at N_E. P_B will secure N_E.

First, I simulate Part 1 using the true preferences of all agents:
Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E; P_C applies to N_D; P_E applies to N_C. Tentative matches: N_E admits P_B (rejecting P_A, P_D); N_D admits P_C; N_C admits P_E.

1. Identify the best possible outcome for Parent_A: Parent_A prefers N_E (Rank 1). However, N_E highly prioritizes Parent_B (Rank 2) over Parent_A (Rank 3). Since Parent_B also ranks N_E first, Parent_B will secure N_E in Round 1, regardless of Parent_A's actions, provided Parent_B submits N_E first (which they do based on true preferences).

2. Determine the second best outcome: Parent_A prefers N_B (Rank 2). Parent_A has the highest priority at N_B (Rank 1). When Parent_A submits their true list [E, B, D, A, C], they are rejected from N_E in R1, but apply to N_B in R2, securing the spot since N_B is still empty and P_A has highest priority.

   - The final stable matching outcome (M_S) results in Parent_B being matched with N_E (Rank 1).

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents).
   - Parent_B was temporarily admitted at N_E and caused rejections (P_A, P_D). 
   - However, Parent_B's final admission (N_E) is the same as the temporary admission. Therefore, Parent_B does not meet the 'Discrepancy' condition and is not a blocking Parent. Part 2 does not modify P_B's match.

3. Strategic Consideration:

1. Analyze the highest preference, Nursery_E (Rank 1):
In Round 1, Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_D all propose to Nursery_E. Nursery_E's priority list is E > B > A > D > C. Parent_B (Rank 2) wins over Parent_A (Rank 3) and Parent_D (Rank 4). Since Parent_B secures N_E (their Rank 1) and is stable there, N_E is unreachable for Parent_D.

2. Analyze the next preference, Nursery_A (Rank 2):
If Parent_D submits truthfully, they are rejected by N_E in R1 and propose to N_A in R2. N_A has a vacant seat and admits Parent_D (N_A priority: B > D > A > C > E; P_D is Rank 2). This results in a match (D, A).

3. Stability and Optimality:
The resulting assignment (D, A) is stable, meaning Parent_D has achieved their highest possible stable match (since N_E is unreachable). In the DAA setting, submitting the true preference list is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing agents (Parents) to secure their best stable outcome.

4. Impact of Part 2 ('Blocking Parents'):
Since Parent_D is only admitted once (in R2 to N_A) and remains matched there, Parent_D does not become a 'blocking parent' (they did not hold a temporary spot and then move away, causing others' rejections). Therefore, Part 2 does not modify the input lists or trigger a rerun.

First, I analyzed the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (truthful submission is strategy-proof in standard DA).

Part 1 (Truthful Submission):
Round 1 results in N_E admitting Parent_B (rejecting P_A, P_D), N_C admitting P_E, and N_D admitting P_C.
Round 2 results in N_B admitting P_A and N_A admitting P_D.

Only Parent_B caused rejections (at N_E in R1). Parent_B's temporary admission (N_E) equals their final admission (N_E).

Crucially, the rules state that this automatic waiver 'will never change your final admission but may improve other Parents' final admissions.'

1. Simulation of Part 1 (DAA) using True Preferences:
   - Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D propose N_E. N_E prioritizes P_B (Rank 2) > P_A (Rank 3) > P_D (Rank 4). P_B is admitted to N_E. P_A and P_D are rejected.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   A parent P is 'blocking' at nursery N if P was temporarily admitted at N, caused rejections, AND ultimately matched elsewhere (M_DA(P) != N).
   - Only P_B caused rejections (at N_E in Round 1). Since M_DA(P_B) = N_E, P_B is not a blocking parent.
   - No other temporary admission caused rejections by displacing another parent.

1. Simulation using True Preferences (Part 1):

2. In Round 2, P_D applies to their 2nd choice, N_A. N_A admits P_D. The final stable match for P_D is N_A (2nd choice).
3. Part 2 Check: Since the resulting match is stable, no parent who caused a rejection (like P_B at N_E) subsequently moved or was rejected. Thus, no blocking parents are found, and the allocation remains final.

Since Parent_D cannot achieve N_E (as P_B has higher priority there), N_A (the 2nd choice) is the best achievable outcome. This is secured by submitting the true preferences.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

1. Check R1 applications based on TPL:

1. Initial DAA Simulation (Truthful Reporting): Parent_A (P_A) submits ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C']. In Round 1, P_A proposes to N_E but is rejected because Parent_B (P_B) has higher priority at N_E. P_B is admitted to N_E. In Round 2, P_A proposes to N_B and is admitted (P_A has the highest priority at N_B). The resulting stable matching (S) assigns P_A to N_B (Rank 2).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Parents Check): Part 2 modifies the outcome only if a parent temporarily admitted at a nursery (causing others to be rejected) ultimately moves elsewhere. In the stable matching S, only P_B caused rejections (at N_E), but P_B remains matched at N_E. Since no parent admitted in R1 was subsequently rejected, there are no 'blocking parents' in S. Therefore, the procedure ends after Part 1, and the final assignment is N_B.

3. Strategic Consideration: Since P_A cannot displace P_B at N_E due to lower priority, Rank 2 (N_B) is the maximum achievable rank. Any deviation from the truthful list (E, B, D, A, C) that might trigger a blocking parent scenario (as demonstrated in testing a D > B > E > A > C submission) results in a final stable matching where P_A is worse off (N_D, Rank 3).

2.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_A: E > B > D > A > C):
   - Nursery_E (1st choice) is unattainable because Parent_B also prefers N_E first, and N_E ranks P_B higher than P_A (P_B > P_A at N_E). P_A will be rejected by N_E in Round 1.

First, I analyzed the outcome assuming all parents, including Parent_D, report truthfully:
1. R1 Proposals: P_A(E), P_B(E), P_C(D), P_D(E), P_E(C).
2. R1 Outcomes: N_E admits P_B (highest priority among applicants P_A, P_B, P_D). N_C admits P_E. N_D admits P_C. P_A and P_D are rejected.

4. R2 Outcomes: N_B admits P_A. N_A admits P_D.

The final outcome under truthful reporting is M(P_D) = N_A, which is Parent_D's 2nd preference. Since Parent_D cannot achieve their 1st choice (N_E) because Parent_B has higher priority at N_E and also proposes N_E first, N_A represents the best stable outcome achievable for P_D.

Second, I checked if manipulating the list could yield a better result or if the Part 2 rule could be leveraged. Because Parent_D is generally low priority at their highly preferred schools (N_E 4th, N_B 5th), any attempt to propose lower ranked schools first resulted in either immediate rejection or eventual rejection by a higher priority parent, leading back to N_A (P_D's highest ranked available choice).

Furthermore, in the truthful outcome, no parent was temporarily admitted at one nursery and later moved elsewhere; hence, there are no 'blocking parents' (Part 2 condition 2 is not met). The mechanism terminates after Part 1, yielding the standard P-optimal stable match.

The allocation mechanism is a variation of the Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm. In the standard DA mechanism, truth-telling is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents). I will first simulate the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences.

Part 1 Simulation (DA):
1. Round 1: Parent E proposes to N_C (Rank 1). N_C receives only one application (from E). Since N_C's priority for E (Rank 4) is sufficient, E is temporarily admitted to N_C.
2. Other major events in R1: N_E receives applications from A, B, D. N_E admits B (highest priority). A and D are rejected.
3. Round 2: A proposes to N_B, D proposes to N_A. Both are admitted, filling all remaining seats.

Final Match (End of Part 1): A->N_B, B->N_E, C->N_D, D->N_A, E->N_C.

Parent E achieves a match with N_C, which is Rank 1 on the True Preference List.

A key property of the DA algorithm is that it is strategy-proof for the proposing agents (Parents); submitting the true preference list guarantees the Parent-Optimal Stable Matching (POSM), which is the best stable outcome achievable for the parent. First, I determined the POSM based on Parent_A's sincere preferences: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C'].

Execution of Part 1 (Sincere Strategy):
1. P_A proposes N_E. N_E prefers P_B over P_A (P_B gets N_E). P_A is rejected.
2. P_A proposes N_B. N_B prefers P_A over all others proposing N_B (P_A gets N_B).

The final stable matching (M1) is (P_A, N_B). Since N_E is unattainable (P_B has higher priority and prefers N_E), N_B (Rank 2) is the best possible outcome for Parent_A.

Part 2 of the mechanism deals with 'blocking parents' (those who caused temporary rejection but ultimately moved). In the resulting stable matching M1, no parent was rejected after being temporarily admitted; thus, the final admission equals the last temporary admission for all parents. Therefore, no blocking parents exist, and Part 2 does not alter M1.

1. Standard DAA Execution (Part 1):
If all parents submit their true preferences (including Parent_B):
Round 1 results in P_B being temporarily admitted to N_E (P_B's rank 1 choice), as P_B has the second highest priority at N_E (after P_E, who proposes N_C) among applicants P_A, P_B, P_D.
Round 2 concludes the matching process.
The final stable match M is: (P_B, N_E), (P_E, N_C), (P_C, N_D), (P_A, N_B), (P_D, N_A).

2. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2):
Since P_B achieves their Rank 1 choice (N_E), they cannot improve their outcome. Furthermore, in the resulting stable matching, no parent was admitted temporarily only to be rejected later in Part 1. Therefore, there is no discrepancy between temporary and final admissions for any parent, and no 'blocking parents' are identified. The process ends immediately with the stable match M.

1. Calculate the outcome (M1) if all parents submit their true preferences (Part 1):
    * Round 1: P_B secures N_E (highest priority among applicants A, B, D). P_C secures N_D. P_E secures N_C. P_A and P_D are rejected.
    * Round 2: P_A applies to N_B (2nd choice). P_D applies to N_A (2nd choice). Both are accepted.
    * Final Match M1: {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}. Parent_A is matched with N_B (2nd choice).

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2):
    * A blocking parent must have been temporarily admitted at N, caused a rejection, and then moved away from N in M1. 
    * In Round 1, P_B was temporarily admitted at N_E and stayed there (M1(P_B)=N_E). No other temporary admission caused rejections where the temporarily admitted parent subsequently moved.
    * Since M1 is stable under true preferences and no blocking parents were found, the matching M1 is the final outcome.

3. Conclusion: Since the truthful submission strategy yields Parent_A's second-best choice (N_B), and the DA algorithm is strategy-proof, any deviation is unlikely to result in a better outcome (N_E is unattainable due to P_B's higher priority at N_E).

In this outcome, Parent_B is matched with Nursery_E, which is their Rank 1 choice.

Parent_C's TPL: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].

If all parents submit their TPLs, the DA process (Part 1) yields the following stable matching:

1. Calculate the outcome based on all agents submitting their True Preferences (DAA run):
    * Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to E. P_B admitted (highest priority). P_A, P_D rejected. P_C applies to D (admitted). P_E applies to C (admitted).

2. Analyze potential manipulation: Since Parent_D cannot overcome Parent_B's higher priority at Nursery_E (P_D's 1st choice), Nursery_A (2nd choice) is the best achievable outcome in a stable match. Any attempt to manipulate the list (e.g., ranking A first, or B first) leads to the same outcome (Nursery_A) or worse, as confirmed by simulations. 

3. Address Part 2 (Blocking Parents): The rules state that the automatic waiver triggered by identifying a blocking parent will 'never change your final admission.' This confirms that the stable outcome achieved in Part 1 based on the submitted list is robust.

Part 1 (DA execution with true preferences):
Round 1:
- Applications: A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C.
- Nursery E: Applicants {A, B, D}. Priorities: B(N2) > A(N3) > D(N4). E admits B. A, D rejected.
- Nursery C: Admits E.
- Nursery D: Admits C.
Round 2:
- Rejected A applies P2: B. B admits A (A is N1 at B).
- Rejected D applies P2: A. A admits D.
Final Matching M: A->B, B->E, C->D, D->A, E->C.
Parent A is matched with Nursery B (Rank 2).

Since this standard DA outcome is stable, the temporary admissions match the final admissions (M_temp = M_final). Therefore, no parent meets the 'Discrepancy' condition of Part 2, and no reruns are triggered. The final outcome is A -> B.

Strategic Analysis: Parent A wants E (Rank 1). However, Parent B also wants E (Rank 1) and has higher priority than A at E (B is N2, A is N3). B will always displace A at E if both apply. Since B applies to E first, A cannot obtain E unless B is diverted, which is impossible without assuming other parents misrepresent their lists, or unless A can trigger Part 2 to benefit them. Attempts to manipulate A's list (e.g., swapping B and D, or leading with B/D) resulted in Rank 3 or worse, or still Rank 2.

1. Simulate Part 1 (DA) assuming all parents submit true preferences:
   - Round 1: P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. N_E priorities: P_E > P_B > P_A > P_D. N_E accepts P_B. P_A, P_D are rejected. P_C->N_D, P_E->N_C are accepted.

   - P_D's outcome is N_A (2nd choice).

   - No parent meets the criteria for being a 'blocking parent' (Prevention and Discrepancy). Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger any list modifications or reruns.

   - Parent A's most preferred school, Nursery E, is also highly preferred by Parent B and Parent D. At Nursery E, Parent B (2nd priority) has higher priority than Parent A (3rd priority). If Parent A applies to N_E, they will be rejected by Parent B.
   - Parent A's second choice, Nursery B, is secured by Parent A because they hold the highest priority at N_B (P_A is 1st).

My highest preference, Nursery E, is also the top choice for Parents B and D. However, Parent B has higher priority than Parent A at Nursery E (B is 2nd priority, A is 3rd). Therefore, Parent A cannot displace Parent B to get Nursery E, assuming B submits truthfully. 

Calculating the truthful DA outcome (where all parents submit their true preferences):
Round 1 results in B being tentatively matched to E, C to D, and E to C. A and D are rejected by E.
Round 2 results in A matching with B (A's rank 2) and D matching with A (D's rank 2).
Final Match (M_T): (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C). Parent A receives Nursery B (Rank 2).

Since M_T is a stable match, no parent was temporarily admitted and subsequently moved to a different final assignment during Part 1, meaning no 'blocking parents' exist (Condition 2 of Part 2 is not met).

**Running DAA (Truthful Submission):**
Round 1:
1. P_A, P_B, P_D apply to N_E. N_E prioritizes P_B (2nd priority) over P_A (3rd) and P_D (4th). N_E T-admits P_B. P_A and P_D are rejected.
2. P_C applies to N_D (T-admitted). P_E applies to N_C (T-admitted).

Round 2:
1. P_A applies to N_B (2nd choice). N_B T-admits P_A.
2. P_D applies to N_A (2nd choice). N_A T-admits P_D.

Matching M1: {(P_D, N_A)}. Parent_D is matched with N_A (Rank 2).

**Checking Part 2 (Blocking Parents):**
In M1, P_B, P_C, P_E were T-admitted in Round 1 and stayed matched there. P_A and P_D were rejected in R1 and secured their match in R2. No parent was temporarily admitted to a school and then moved to a different school, meaning no temporary admission caused a rejection only for the parent to ultimately leave the spot unused. Therefore, no blocking parents are found, and M1 is the final match.

Since N_E (Rank 1) is unavailable due to P_B having higher priority and also applying, N_A (Rank 2) is the best achievable outcome for Parent_D.

1. Baseline Calculation (True Preferences): I first calculated the stable matching (Part 1) assuming all parents submit their true preferences. Parent_A's true preferences are E > B > D > A > C. In Round 1, Parent_A proposes to N_E but is rejected because Parent_B has higher priority (P_B: 2nd, P_A: 3rd) and also proposes to N_E. In Round 2, Parent_A proposes to N_B and is accepted (P_A is 1st priority at N_B). The resulting match is M(P_A) = N_B (2nd choice).

2. Priority Constraint Check: Parent_A cannot achieve N_E because Parent_B strictly prefers N_E (1st choice) and has higher priority than Parent_A at N_E. Thus, N_B is the best stable outcome Parent_A can achieve.

3. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2): I verified that in the stable matching M_True, no parent meets the criteria for being a 'blocking parent' (a parent who was temporarily admitted at a nursery, causing rejection, but moved elsewhere). Since Part 2 does not activate, the final outcome remains N_B.

4. Manipulation Analysis: Since N_B is the best stable match achievable, manipulating preferences (e.g., proposing to N_B first or swapping lower preferences) would either yield the same outcome (N_B) or a worse outcome (e.g., N_D or N_C), as demonstrated in the thought process analysis.

   In Round 1, Parent_E applies to Nursery_C. No other parent applies to Nursery_C in R1 because their first choices are Nursery_E (P_A, P_B, P_D) or Nursery_D (P_C). Parent_E is temporarily admitted to Nursery_C.

1. Initial DA Simulation (using True Preferences):

2. Stability and Blocking Parents:
