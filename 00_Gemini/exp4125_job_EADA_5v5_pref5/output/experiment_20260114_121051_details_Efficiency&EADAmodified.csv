1. Initial Analysis (True Preferences: B>C>A>E>D):
If all agents submit true preferences (M_True), the stable outcome is (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E). Seeker_A gets Company_A (3rd choice).

2. Blocking Seeker Check:
The execution path of M_True reveals multiple blocking seekers (e.g., C at B, D at C). This triggers Part 2, leading to successive modifications of preference lists (C removes B, D removes C, A removes A). 
After the lists converge through multiple reruns of DA (M_Final), the final stable matching results in Seeker_A being matched with Company_D (5th choice).

3. Strategic Manipulation:

2. Analyzing my second choice, Company_B: My priority is 2nd (P_C(B) = [E, B, C, D, A]). Only Seeker_E has higher priority. However, Seeker_E ranks C_B last (5th choice) and will propose to C_C, C_D, C_A, and C_E before reaching C_B.

However, tracing the path revealed that Seeker A and Seeker C became 'blocking Job Seekers' at Company B (due to temporary admissions and subsequent movements/rejections). The rules dictate that this triggers Part 2, where Company B is removed from A's and C's lists, and the DA process is rerun. This rerun destabilized the market significantly, resulting in Seeker B becoming unmatched in the final outcome, which is unacceptable.

2. Analyze Strategic Preferences (B, A, C, D, E):
I recognize that Rank 1 (Company A) is likely unattainable because Company A prefers Seeker A (3rd priority) over me (4th priority), and Seeker A is willing to apply to A. Therefore, Rank 2 (Company B) is the highest realistic goal.
Company B prioritizes me (Seeker B) second overall. By proposing to Company B first, I secure the match in Round 1 (I beat C, D, A who also proposed B, since I have higher priority than them). The resulting matching $M'$ is (A, D), (B, B), (C, C), (D, E), (E, A).

3. Verify Stability and Part 2 Avoidance:
This matching $M'$ gives me Rank 2 (Company B). Crucially, by tracing the path of temporary admissions for $M'$, I confirmed that no Job Seeker meets the criteria for being a 'blocking Job Seeker' (i.e., every seeker who was temporarily admitted at a company and caused rejections ultimately remained matched with that company, or the temporary admission caused no rejections). Since no blocking seekers are found, the procedure terminates immediately, and $M'$ is the final outcome.

   The initial DA (Part 1) results in Seeker_B matching with Company_B (Rank #2). However, the subsequent application of the Part 2 waiver mechanism repeatedly modifies the preference lists of other seekers (specifically S_A, S_C, and S_D) due to them being identified as 'blocking seekers.' This process ultimately frees up Company_A (my Rank #1) in the final rerun of DA. The final outcome is (Seeker_B, Company_A).

2. Submission of Misrepresentation (e.g., R'_B = ['Company_B', 'Company_A', ...]):
   If I prioritize C_B, I secure C_B early in the process. However, this submission does not trigger the necessary blocking behavior in other seekers that would lead to C_A becoming available for me later. The final outcome is (Seeker_B, Company_B).

I tested several choice ranking lists for Seeker_E (True Preference: C > D > A > E > B):
1. Submitting True Preferences [C, D, A, E, B]: The initial DAA run resulted in E matching D (Rank 2). However, subsequent blocking checks forced waivers on other seekers, leading to a final stable matching where E was matched to Company A (Rank 3).

My outcome is Company B (2nd choice).

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2): Seeker_A, who displaced me at Company A in K=3, eventually matches with Company E (K=7). Since Seeker_A's temporary admission at Company A caused my rejection, and Seeker_A's final admission is different from Company A, Seeker_A is identified as a 'blocking Job Seeker' at Company A (K=3). 

3. Rerun: The procedure forces Seeker_A to waive Company A and reruns Part 1. In this rerun, when I propose to Company A (K=1), Seeker_A proposes elsewhere (Company B). Since Seeker_A is no longer competing for Company A, I secure the position at Company A (A: Seeker_B) in the final stable match of the rerun.

   The stable matching M resulted in Seeker C matched to Company D (Rank 3).
2. Blocking Seeker Analysis (Part 2):

Seeker C achieved Company C (Rank 2) by submitting their truthful preferences, as the mechanism corrected the instability caused by other seekers' applications.

The complex Part 2 of the mechanism addresses 'blocking job seekers,' which are agents whose temporary admission caused rejections but who ultimately moved elsewhere. This typically aims to prevent certain forms of strategic parking or manipulation.

1. Analysis of Target (C_B, Rank 1): My most preferred company, Company_B, ranks me 4th (behind S_E, S_B, S_C). Since S_C (ranked 3rd by C_B) also prefers C_B first, S_C will secure the spot over me if we both apply truthfully in Round 1. Therefore, C_B is realistically unattainable.
2. Analysis of Truthful Submission: If I submit my True Preference List (TPL: B > C > A > E > D), the initial DA run (Part 1) results in a temporary match of (S_D, C_A) [Rank 3]. However, the subsequent application of the Part 2 waiver rule (due to S_A being a blocking seeker) forces a rerun. The final stable outcome achieved after the Part 2 iteration is (S_D, C_C) [Rank 2].

1. Analyze the outcome using True Preferences (Standard DA):
   The simulation of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm using everyone's true preferences resulted in Seeker_A matching with Company_E (P4). This outcome was stable and did not trigger the blocking seeker mechanism (Part 2).

2. Evaluate strategic misrepresentation:
   Seeker_A has low priority at P1 (B, Q5) and P2 (C, Q5). However, Seeker_A has moderate priority at P3 (A, Q3) and high priority at P4 (E, Q1) and P5 (D, Q2).
   Targeting P3 (Company_A) is a viable strategy, as Seeker_A ranks third at Company_A, ahead of Seeker_B (Q4) who also prefers A highly (P1).

3. Test Strategic List: Prioritize Company_A (P3) as the top choice: ['Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_C', 'Company_E', 'Company_D'].
   R1: Seeker_A -> A. Seeker_B -> A. Company_A receives {A, B}. Since Q_A prioritizes A (Q3) over B (Q4), Company_A temporarily admits A and rejects B.

1. Initial Simulation (Part 1) using True Preferences:
If I submit my true preferences, the initial DAA simulation results in a temporary match M = {(S_D, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. My outcome (S_B) is C_B (Rank #2).

2. BJS Analysis (Part 2):
In this history, several seekers qualify as BJS because they caused rejections at companies they ultimately did not match with:
- S_A is BJS at C_A (rejected S_B in Round 3).
- S_C is BJS at C_B (rejected S_A/S_D in Round 1).
- S_D is BJS at C_C (rejected S_E in Round 2).

3. Rerunning DAA with Waivers:
Part 2 forces these BJS to waive the companies where they blocked others. The DAA is rerun with the updated preference lists.
- S_A waives C_A.
- S_C waives C_B.
- S_D waives C_C.

4. Final Outcome:
The rerun DAA stabilizes immediately with the final matching M' = {(S_B, C_A), (S_D, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. In this final matching, I (Seeker_B) am matched with Company_A.

Since Seeker_E prefers C and D over A, if I submit truthfully, Seeker_E eventually reaches Company_A and displaces me (as shown in the standard DA trace, resulting in S_B -> C_D).

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Company_D): After being rejected by C_C in Round 2, I apply to C_D (my 2nd choice) in Round 3. C_D has priority list: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']. C_D prefers me (E, rank 4) over Seeker B (rank 5), who eventually applies to C_D later.

1. JS-DA Simulation (Using True Preferences):

In the truthful scenario (P_B = [A, B, C, D, E]), Seeker_B ultimately matches with Company_C (3rd choice).

2. Analyze Potential Misrepresentation: My 1st choice, Company_A, prioritizes Seeker_E (1st) and Seeker_D (2nd) above me (4th). Seeker_E and Seeker_D are highly likely to apply or move towards Company_A, leading to my rejection. My 2nd choice, Company_B, prioritizes me (Seeker_B) 2nd, behind Seeker_E (1st). If I propose to B first, I have a strong chance of securing the position early, potentially preventing Seeker_E from claiming it (as E proposes C/D first).

3. Simulation of Misrepresentation (P'_B = [B, A, C, D, E]): By prioritizing Company_B first, Seeker_B successfully secures a match with Company_B in Round 1, even after accounting for the preferences of Seeker_A, Seeker_C, and Seeker_D who also apply to B. This early match prevents B from having to seek Company_C later.

4. Verification of Stability: A full simulation of the market process (Part 1 and Part 2 iterations, accounting for waivers applied to Seeker_C, Seeker_D, and Seeker_E based on earlier runs) confirms that submitting P'_B results in a final stable matching (M_9) where Seeker_B is matched to Company_B (2nd choice). Furthermore, M_9 contains no blocking seekers relative to the submitted lists, ensuring the outcome is final according to the rules.

Since achieving Company_B (2nd choice) is strictly better than Company_C (3rd choice), misrepresentation is the optimal strategy in this environment.",False,Company_B,True,False,2

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Reporting):
If all seekers report their true preferences, the DA algorithm (Part 1) results in the temporary matching M_temp: (A, E), (B, D), (C, B), (D, C), (E, A). My outcome is a match with Company_A (3rd choice).

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Truthful):
I traced the temporary admissions in M_temp. No seeker who was temporarily admitted at a company (causing rejections) ultimately moved away from that company. Therefore, no blocking seekers are identified. M_temp is the final stable matching M_final.

3. Strategic Analysis:
I tested a strategic deviation (prioritizing D: [D, C, A, E, B]) to achieve a better outcome. This attempt successfully matched me with D (2nd choice) in the first run, but it caused Seeker D to become a blocking seeker twice, leading to list truncations for D. After two reruns, the final outcome converged back to me matching with A (3rd choice), and Seeker B ended up unmatched. This demonstrates that strategic manipulation relying on temporary blocking is unstable and likely penalized by the Part 2 mechanism.

2.

I submitted the list: ['Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_C', 'Company_D', 'Company_E'].

In standard JSDA, submitting true preferences is the dominant strategy for the proposing side (Seekers) to secure the best possible stable match. I will assume this holds, as manipulation often leads to worse outcomes, especially when considering the complex interaction of other agents' preferences and the Part 2 rules.

1. Initial Simulation (Truthful Submission: B > C > A > E > D):
   The JSDA process (Part 1) results in Seeker_D matching with Company_A (3rd choice). My higher choices, C_B and C_C, are blocked by higher priority seekers (S_C at C_B, S_B at C_C).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers):
   The initial stable match M generated by Part 1 included temporary admissions that caused rejections but did not result in a final match at that company (e.g., Seeker_A temporarily held Company_A, rejecting Seeker_B, only to later move to Company_E). This triggered the blocking seeker rule.

3. Rerun Simulation (After S_A waives C_A):
   When the procedure reruns with Seeker_A skipping Company_A, the chain of rejections is broken. Seeker_B remains matched with Company_A (his 1st choice) earlier in the process, preventing him from applying to Company_C (his 3rd choice). Since Seeker_B (Priority #1 at C_C) never applies to C_C, Seeker_D (Priority #3 at C_C), who applied to C_C in R2, is able to secure the spot.

4. Final Outcome:
   The final outcome achieved by submitting my true preferences, after the system refinement in Part 2, is a match with Company_C (2nd choice).

1. Target Analysis: I prefer Company_C (C_C). C_C prioritizes seekers S_B > S_C > S_D > S_E. Since C_C prefers S_D over me (S_E), and S_D applies to C_C after being rejected by C_B (S_D's #1 choice), I will inevitably be displaced from C_C by S_D if I apply there first.

2. Simulation using True Preferences (TPL): Simulating the DA process (Part 1) using everyone's true preferences results in the stable matching M1 = { (S_A, C_E), (S_B, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_D, C_A), (S_E, C_D) }. My outcome is C_D (Rank 2).

3. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2): Although M1 is stable, the temporary admissions in Part 1 created blocking seekers (S_C at C_B, S_A at C_A). This triggers a rerun (Rerun 1) with S_A's list modified (C_A removed).

3. Rerun DA: With C_A removed from S_A's list, the DA process was rerun. In the rerun, I (Seeker_B) applied to C_A in R1 and was temporarily admitted. Since S_A could no longer apply to C_A in later rounds, and no other higher-priority seeker challenged me at C_A, I retained the admission.

4. Final Outcome: The final matching after the rerun and subsequent Part 2 check (which found no new blocking seekers) was: S_B->C_A, S_C->C_B, S_D->C_C, S_E->C_D, S_A->C_E. I achieved my 1st choice (Company_A).

However, Company_B receives applications from Seeker_A, Seeker_C, and Seeker_D. Since Company_B prioritizes Seeker_C (3rd) over Seeker_D (4th), Seeker_C secures Company_B.

2. Risk of Truthful Submission:
If I submit truthfully ('Company_B' first), I am temporarily admitted to Company_B in Round 1, causing the rejection of others. Since I am later rejected by Company_B (when Seeker_B applies in R4) and end up matching Company_C, I become a 'blocking Job Seeker' at Company_B according to Part 2 rules.

Tracing the DAA using truthful preferences results in a stable matching $M_1$ where Seeker_B matches with Company_D (Rank 4).

I explored manipulating the list to secure a higher-ranked company, particularly Company_A (Rank 1) or Company_B (Rank 2), by proposing to them earlier or later depending on market competition.

If I submit ['Company_B', 'Company_A', 'Company_C', 'Company_D', 'Company_E']:

This early acceptance allows B to secure Company_B, which is Rank 2 on my true list. Tracing the full DAA process confirms that this configuration leads to a stable matching ($M^{IV}$) where Seeker_B is matched with Company_B.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_D = [B, C, A, E, D]):
   A simulation of the standard Job Seeker Proposing Deferred Acceptance (JSDA) using truthful lists yields the stable matching M* where Seeker_D matches with Company_A (3rd choice). However, this matching M* generates multiple 'blocking job seekers' (S_C, S_D, S_A) based on the history of temporary admissions versus final matches. The iterative Part 2 procedure removes higher-ranked choices from the lists of blocking seekers (including C_C and C_A from my list, S_D). This process ultimately converges to a final stable matching M**** where Seeker_D is matched with Company_E (4th choice).

2. Strategic Manipulation:
   To prevent the Part 2 mechanism from removing my preferred companies (C_C, C_A) due to my participation in blocking chains, I must secure a highly preferred company early and ensure that this temporary admission becomes my final match. My priority at C_B (1st choice) is 4th, making it highly unlikely to secure. My priority at C_C (2nd choice) is 3rd. My priority at C_A (3rd choice) is 2nd (higher than S_B and S_A who apply there early).

3. Targeting Company_A:
   By submitting Company_A as my 1st choice (P'_D = [A, B, C, E, D]), I successfully secure a temporary match with C_A in Round 1 (C_A prefers S_D (2nd priority) over S_B (4th priority)). Subsequent rounds of JSDA, followed by the Part 2 stabilization check, show that S_D remains matched with C_A. Critically, S_D is never identified as a blocking seeker in the history generated by this manipulated list, as S_D's temporary admission at C_A (R1) becomes S_D's final assignment M''' (S_D <-> C_A). This prevents the destabilizing chain reaction that pushes me down to C_E.

1. Initial Analysis (TPL): If all agents submit their True Preference Lists (TPL), the resulting stable matching (M) is calculated. For Seeker_A, the stable outcome is Company_E (4th choice: B, C, A, E, D). 
2. Attainability Check: Due to Seeker_A's low priority at Company_B (5th), Company_C (5th), and Company_A (3rd), higher ranked companies (B, C, A) are unavailable in any stable matching, as other seekers (C, D, E) have higher priority at those companies and prefer them over their final stable matches.

2. Part 2 Iteration 1 (Rerun 1): Seeker_C is identified as blocking at Company_B (R1). Company_B is removed from S_C's list. Rerun 1 results in S_B <=> Company_B again.
3. Part 2 Iteration 2 (Rerun 2): Seeker_A is identified as blocking at Company_A (R3). Company_A is removed from S_A's list. This modification is crucial. When Rerun 2 commences, Seeker_C proposes to C_C (securing it early), diverting Seeker_E to propose to C_D instead of C_A. Since Seeker_E (C_A's top choice) is matched elsewhere, Company_A becomes available for me (Seeker_B), who proposed to C_A in R1 and held the temporary admission until the end of Part 1. The final match (M3) is S_B <=> Company_A (my 1st choice).
4. Stability Check: M3 has no blocking seekers, meaning the process terminates here, and I secure my optimal outcome (C_A).

I submit my TPL. The standard Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1) results in a stable matching M_T = {(S_E, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_D, C_C), (S_C, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. My temporary admission is C_C (Rank 2).

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2):
In the path to M_T, Seeker_C (S_C) was temporarily admitted to Company_B (C_B) in Round 1, causing S_A and S_D to be rejected. S_C was later rejected by S_B in Round 4 and ended up at C_D. Since S_C's temporary admission at C_B differs from their final admission, S_C is identified as a blocking seeker at C_B. The procedure removes C_B from S_C's list and reruns DA.

3. Rerun Outcome:
The rerun of Part 1 (with S_C waiving C_B) leads to the final stable matching M_R = {(S_D, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. My final admission is C_A (Rank 3).

I checked if strategically manipulating my list (e.g., submitting C_C first: [C, B, A, E, D] or C_A first: [A, B, C, E, D]) could prevent S_C from becoming a blocker or lead to a higher ranked final outcome.

1. Analysis of Truthful Revelation (TPL: [B, C, A, E, D]):
If I submit my TPL, the initial run of Part 1 results in me matching with Company_E (Rank 4).

2. Part 2 (Blocking Seekers): This match M contains blocking seekers because several seekers were temporarily admitted but ultimately moved elsewhere, causing rejections.

3. Part 1 Rerun (Modified Preferences): When DAA is rerun with the forced waivers (A waives A, C waives B, D waives C), the outcome changes significantly. The new stable matching M' is found: M' = {(A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D)}. Seeker B matches with Company A (1st choice).

1. Analysis of C_B (Rank 1):
Company_B's priority list is [Seeker_E, Seeker_B, Seeker_C, Seeker_D, Seeker_A]. I am ranked 4th (P4). Seeker_C (P3) ranks C_B as their 1st choice. In the standard DA simulation where all seekers submit true preferences, Seeker_C successfully matches with Company_B (Rank 1 for S_C). Since S_C achieves their top choice, they are never a 'blocking seeker' at C_B, and C_B remains unattainable for me.

2. Analysis of C_C (Rank 2):
If I submit my true preferences L_D = [B, C, A, E, D], the initial run of Part 1 results in S_D matching with C_A (Rank 3). However, this run generates 'blocking seekers' (S_A at C_A, S_D at C_C), triggering Part 2. After S_A is forced to remove C_A from their list, the procedure reruns (Rerun 1).

3. Final Outcome:
In the stable matching M, Seeker_D matches with Company_C, which is my 2nd choice. Since C_B is stably taken by a higher priority seeker (S_C), C_C is the highest possible outcome.

Submitting true preferences in DAA is usually strategy-proof, but the punitive Part 2 waivers can penalize seekers whose temporary admissions caused rejections but whose final matches were elsewhere. 

1. Analysis of True Preferences Submission: Submitting [C, D, A, E, B] leads to an initial stable match M*(E) = A (Rank 3). However, Seeker E becomes a blocking seeker (at A in R3) because E moved from A to E (wait, M(E)=A, E is not blocking at A, let's re-run the final blocking analysis for true preferences). Correct analysis showed that if E submits true preferences, the iterative Part 2 procedure ultimately forces waivers on E's list (specifically C and A are waived in Iteration 3 analysis), resulting in a final outcome M_F(E) = E (Rank 4).

2. Strategy: To achieve a better outcome and prevent forced waivers, I must choose a submission list (L_E) that results in a stable matching M* where Seeker E is NOT a blocking seeker. Seeker E has the highest priority (P_A(1)) at Company A (Rank 3 preference).

3. Testing L_E = [A, C, D, E, B]: By proposing to A first, E secures A immediately (R1). The resulting initial stable matching is M* = {A:E, B:B, C:C, D:D, E:A}. Since M*(E) = A and E's temporary match at A was E (R1) or E (R3), and E's final match is A, E is NOT a blocking seeker. Only Seeker A is blocking (at E).

1. Calculate the Stable Matching (M) using True Preferences:

I simulated the outcome assuming all seekers submit their True Preference Lists (P_true). This analysis showed that the initial matching (M_P1) resulted in D matching with Company D (Rank 5).

If Seeker D attempts to misreport preferences (e.g., removing Company C, or ranking A first), the path of temporary admissions changes (Simulations 7 & 8). In both cases, the immediate outcome for D was worse (Rank 5 or Rank 3), and critically, the resulting blocking seeker configuration would likely lead to a different sequence of waivers, potentially preventing the mechanism from reaching the optimal D->B match.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (Truthful Submission: B > C > A > E > D):
   - Company B (Rank 1) prioritizes Seeker A last (5th). In Round 1, B receives proposals from C, D, and A, and selects C (3rd priority), rejecting A.
   - Company C (Rank 2) prioritizes Seeker A last (5th). In Round 1/2, C receives proposals from E and D, who both have higher priority than A, resulting in A's rejection.
   - Seeker A eventually secures Company A (Rank 3) in Round 3.
   - The resulting matching is M_stable: (A, A), (B, E), (C, B), (D, C), (E, D).

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers):
   - When applying the truthful strategy, no temporary admission causes a rejection while the seeker eventually moves elsewhere. Thus, no blocking seekers are identified, and the matching M_stable is the final outcome.

3. Strategic Deviation:
   - Since Seeker A has the lowest priority at both Rank 1 (B) and Rank 2 (C), manipulation is highly unlikely to succeed in obtaining B or C, as this requires A to displace multiple higher-priority seekers (C, D at B; D, E at C). Attempts to deviate (e.g., proposing E or D first) resulted in a worse outcome (Rank 4 or 5) or the same outcome, often leading to A being rejected earlier by the higher-ranked companies.

Conclusion: Given the unfavorable priorities for Seeker A at the top preferred companies and the strategy-proof nature of the underlying DA mechanism, the optimal strategy is to submit the true preferences to guarantee the proposer-optimal outcome (Rank 3, Company A) achieved in the stable matching, avoiding the risk of worse outcomes through unsuccessful manipulation.",True,Company_E,False,True,4
