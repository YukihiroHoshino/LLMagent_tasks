2. In Round 2, D proposes to Company A (Rank 2). Company A admits D.

The stable outcome for Seeker D is Company A (Rank 2).

I first calculated the stable matching assuming all agents submit their true preferences. My true preference list is ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C']. 

In Round 1, I (Seeker_D) propose to Company_E. However, Company_E receives applications from S_A, S_B, and S_D. Company_E prioritizes S_B (2nd) over S_A (3rd) and S_D (4th). S_B is accepted, and I am rejected. 

In Round 2, I propose to my second choice, Company_A. Company_A receives only my application and accepts me.

1. Calculate Stable Matching (Truthful Reporting: S_A submits [E, B, D, A, C]):
   - Round 1: S_A, S_B, S_D propose to E. S_C proposes to D. S_E proposes to C.
   - C_E accepts S_B (Priority: E > B > A). S_A and S_D are rejected.

   - Round 2: S_A proposes to B. S_D proposes to A.
   - C_B accepts S_A (Priority: A > B...). S_A is accepted.
   - C_A accepts S_D.
   - Final Match: (S_A, C_B). This is Rank 2 for Seeker_A.
