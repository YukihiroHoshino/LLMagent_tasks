All higher preferences (B, C, A, E) appear to be unavailable or matched, leaving only Nursery_D (my 5th and final choice) unmatched and available. Since Nursery_D is on my preference list, I must apply to secure a match rather than remain unmatched. Crucially, I check Nursery_D's priority list and find that Parent_D is ranked #1. Given that I am the top priority applicant and it is the last round of opportunity, I must formally apply immediately to secure the allocation."
