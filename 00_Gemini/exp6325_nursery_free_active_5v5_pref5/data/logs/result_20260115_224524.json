Nurseries A and B must also be matched since they are not in the 'not yet matched' list.\nThe only remaining available nursery is Nursery_E, which is my 4th preference.\nSince Nursery_E has capacity 1 and is still unmatched in Round 4, it implies that all parents ranked higher than me on Nursery_E's priority list (Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_B) must have been matched elsewhere (likely A, B, C, or D).\nThis makes Parent_E the highest available applicant for Nursery_E. I should apply immediately and commit fully to secure this match, as it is my only remaining option on my preference list."

While I prefer Parent_A, Parent_C, or Parent_B, they rank me very low (4th or 5th) on their lists, making it unlikely they will apply to me unless they are rejected by multiple other nurseries. Parent_E is applying now, stating I am their highest available choice. Accepting Parent_E guarantees a match that is reasonably high on my list (4th out of 5), fulfilling my quota and avoiding the risk of ending up unmatched or with only my lowest preference (Parent_D). Therefore, I will accept Parent_E."
