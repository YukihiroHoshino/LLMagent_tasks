My goal is to secure a match with Parent_D, Parent_A, or Parent_C. Parent_C still ranks me 3rd on their list, meaning they are likely still pursuing their top two choices (Nursery_B, Nursery_C) but may apply soon.

Parent_E has been rejected four times by Nursery_D, likely because higher priority candidates (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C) were still active or being held. Since four nurseries have matched, it is highly probable that Parent_E is the only remaining unmatched parent, and certainly the highest priority remaining applicant for Nursery_D.

Parent_E is now claiming that all four other nurseries are matched, implying that Parent_D, Parent_A, and Parent_C must have secured placements elsewhere, making Parent_E the highest remaining priority applicant for Nursery_D. Given that this is Round 5 and I still have an unfilled quota, the statistical likelihood that my top three preferences are gone is very high, as they all had highly preferred options (B, C, A, E) available. Accepting Parent_E (Rank 4) is superior to leaving the quota unfilled (Utility 0). Since Parent_E is applying with full commitment, I should secure this match immediately."
