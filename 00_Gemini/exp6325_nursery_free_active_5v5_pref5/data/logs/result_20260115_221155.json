Nursery_B (Rank 1): N_B prefers P_E, P_B, P_C, then P_D (4th priority). P_C ranks N_B 1st and is N_B's 3rd priority. P_A also ranks N_B 1st. It is highly likely N_B will be taken by P_C or P_B, leading to rejection for P_D.\n\n2. Nursery_C (Rank 2): N_C prefers P_B, P_C, then P_D (3rd priority). P_E ranks N_C 1st (P_E is 4th priority for N_C). If P_B targets N_A (P_B's 1st choice) and P_C targets N_B (P_C's 1st choice), N_C will primarily receive applications from P_D and P_E.\n\nN_C prefers P_D (3rd priority) over P_E (4th priority). By applying to N_C, Parent_D maximizes the chance of securing a Rank 2 match in Round 1, potentially displacing P_E who is also targeting N_C.\n\n3. Nursery_A (Rank 3): N_A prefers P_E, P_D (2nd priority). P_B (1st choice) is N_A's 4th priority. Applying here guarantees a match (P_D beats P_B), but N_C (Rank 2) is a better outcome.\n\nConclusion: Applying to Nursery_C offers the highest expected utility while maintaining a very high probability of acceptance."
