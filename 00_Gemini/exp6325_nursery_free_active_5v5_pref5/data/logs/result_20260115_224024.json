I must choose between the remaining unmatched nurseries: N_E (Rank 4) and N_D (Rank 5).\n\nNursery_E ranks me last (5/5). Applying here is highly likely to result in rejection, especially if Parent_A, Parent_C, or Parent_E are still active.\n\nNursery_D ranks me first (1/5). Applying here guarantees an immediate match, as N_D has capacity 1 and I am their highest priority.\n\nSince the matching mechanism is immediate commitment and I have already failed with my top two options, risking the guaranteed match (N_D) for a highly improbable match (N_E) is too risky. If I fail to secure N_E, another parent might secure N_D in the same round, leaving me unmatched. To ensure I secure the highest possible rank that guarantees acceptance, I must apply to Nursery_D."
