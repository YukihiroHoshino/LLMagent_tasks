All nurseries ranked 1st through 4th (B, C, A, E) appear to be matched, as they are not listed in the 'nurseries not yet matched' list. The only remaining option is Nursery_D, which is my 5th and final choice, but still acceptable. Crucially, Nursery_D ranks Parent_D as its highest priority ('Parent_D', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_B'). Since Nursery_D is the last available match, and I have P1 priority, I must apply immediately to secure a placement before any other parent who might prefer D (e.g., Parent_A, P2 on D's list) applies and potentially complicates matters, although my P1 status makes acceptance highly likely."
