I previously rejected Parent_E in an earlier round hoping to secure a higher-ranked parent (P_D, P_A, or P_C).\nHowever, P_D and P_A both rank Nursery_D last (5th), making it highly unlikely they will apply unless all other options fail. P_C ranks me 3rd, but is likely pursuing Nursery_B or Nursery_C where they are highly ranked. Since we are in Round 3 and Parent_E is reapplying, reaffirming their strong commitment and listing me as their highest unmatched option, accepting them now is a prudent move to fulfill the quota. Waiting longer risks losing Parent_E (who might match elsewhere) without a guarantee that any of the top 3 will ever apply. Securing a reliable match at rank 4 is better than remaining unmatched."
