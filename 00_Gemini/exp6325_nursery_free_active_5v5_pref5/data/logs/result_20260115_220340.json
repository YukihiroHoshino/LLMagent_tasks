Reviewing history: I was rejected by Nursery_C (P1) and rejected twice by Nursery_D (P2).\n2. Current status: The only nursery listed as 'not yet matched' is Nursery_D.\n3. Strategy: Since Nursery_D is the only remaining option (and my highly preferred P2 choice), and the market has clearly settled (implying Nurseries A, B, C, E have matched their preferred candidates), Nursery_D has likely exhausted its higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C).\n4. As Parent_E is the 4th priority for Nursery_D, and given the scarcity of remaining options for both parties, this is the optimal time to apply again. I will make a final, firm application, emphasizing immediate commitment, confident that Nursery_D must now accept me to fill their quota.\n5. Action: [APPLY]."

We have carefully reviewed your application against our remaining priorities and are impressed by your commitment to our program. Given the competitive nature of the market and your strong alignment with our values, we are pleased to formally offer you the available place at Nursery_D. We look forward to welcoming your family into our community.",
              "thought": "I am Nursery_D, quota 1. My priority list is ['Parent_D', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_B']. Parent_E is my 4th priority. This is the third time Parent_E has applied, indicating high interest (Nursery_D is their 2nd preference). Although I have higher ranked candidates (D, A, C), they rank me 5th, 5th, and 3rd respectively, and have not applied yet, suggesting they are pursuing higher preferences. Since we are in Round 4 and the market is settling, the probability of securing one of the top 3 is diminishing, and rejecting Parent_E again risks losing a highly interested and acceptable match (Rank 4). Given the persistence and commitment of Parent_E, securing this match now guarantees filling my quota with a high-preference parent, rather than risking going unmatched for potentially unavailable parents. I will accept Parent_E."
