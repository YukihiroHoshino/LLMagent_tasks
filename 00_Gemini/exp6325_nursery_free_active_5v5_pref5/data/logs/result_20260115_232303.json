Nursery_C is also matched (inferred, as only D and E remain unmatched).\nMy remaining options are Nursery_E (4th preference) and Nursery_D (5th preference).\nI must target the highest remaining preference, which is Nursery_E.\n\nI need to check my priority at Nursery_E.\nNursery_E's priority list is: ['Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_D'].\nParent_A is the number one priority for Nursery_E.\n\nSince Nursery_E is unmatched and I am their top choice, I should formally apply immediately to secure the match.
