However, Nursery_D is still unmatched according to the active list, suggesting it hasn't filled its capacity, but a repeat application might lead to rejection again since I am 4th on their priority list.\n\nMy next highest preference is Nursery_A (Rank 3). Checking Nursery_A's priority list reveals that Parent_E is their absolute top priority: ['Parent_E', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C'].\n\nSince Nursery_A is available, and I am their top choice, applying here guarantees a match at my 3rd preferred option. This is a robust strategy to secure a high-quality match immediately, rather than risking further rejection attempting to secure a slightly higher rank (Nursery_D).\n\nI will send an [APPLY] message to Nursery_A."
