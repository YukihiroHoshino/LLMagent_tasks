My highest preference nurseries (B, C, A, E) have either rejected me or matched elsewhere, as only Nursery_D remains unmatched according to the current situation update. Nursery_D is my 5th and lowest preference, but it is still acceptable as it is on my list. Crucially, Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_D first among all parents. Since all higher-ranked options are gone, applying to Nursery_D guarantees a match and prevents me from being unmatched. I will send a formal [APPLY] to secure this spot immediately."
