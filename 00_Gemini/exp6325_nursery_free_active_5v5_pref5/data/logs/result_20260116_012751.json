While I prefer Parent_E, Parent_D, and Parent_A, they are likely applying to their own top choices (Nursery_B or Nursery_C) in this first round. Accepting Parent_B secures a match immediately, fulfilling my quota with a relatively high-ranked parent (4th out of 5) who is highly motivated to attend.

It is highly likely that Parent_C and Parent_D, who were likely rejected by Nursery_B in R1 and rank C as their R2 preference, will apply to C in R2. Since both P_C (Priority 2) and P_D (Priority 3) are prioritized far above P_A, applying to C is extremely risky and likely results in another rejection.\n\n2. Analyzing Nursery_E (Rank 4): Parent_A is the highest priority (Rank 1) for Nursery_E. Although E is my 4th choice, applying here guarantees a match, securing an allocation better than my lowest preference (D).
