Parent B is ranked 4th by Nursery_A. Since Parent_A (Rank 3) is preferred over Parent_B (Rank 4) by Nursery_A, if both apply, Nursery_A will accept Parent_A.\n\nSince applying to my 3rd choice (Nursery_A) results in a high probability of immediate acceptance in Round 1, securing a guaranteed match at Rank 3 is strategically superior to being rejected at Ranks 1 and 2 and risking worse outcomes later.
