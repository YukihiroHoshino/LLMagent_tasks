Ranks 1 (Nursery_B) and 2 (Nursery_C): I am ranked 5th (lowest priority) by both. It is highly probable that Parent_C and Parent_D (for N_B) and Parent_E (for N_C) will apply to these nurseries as they are their top choices, leading to my rejection.\n\n2. Rank 4 (Nursery_E): I am ranked 1st priority here. Applying guarantees a match, but it is low on my preference list.\n\n3. Rank 3 (Nursery_A): I am ranked 3rd priority here. The two parents ranked higher than me (P_E and P_D) both rank N_A 3rd on their own preference lists, preferring N_C and N_B, respectively. Assuming rational behavior where parents apply to their top feasible choice, P_E will likely apply to N_C and P_D will likely apply to N_B. This leaves Parent_A as potentially the highest priority applicant remaining for N_A, competing mainly with Parent_B (who ranks N_A 1st but is 4th priority at N_A).\n\nSince Parent_A (3rd priority) is ranked higher than Parent_B (4th priority) by Nursery_A, applying to Nursery_A in Round 1 maximizes the chance of securing my Rank 3 choice, which is significantly better than settling for Rank 4 (N_E) immediately or being rejected at Rank 1/2."
