Despite your previous decision, we want to reiterate that you remain an exceptionally strong and highly desired option for our family.

My True Preference List is ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B'].\nOnly Nursery_D is currently available (not yet matched). Nursery_D is my Rank 2 preference.\nI have previously applied to Nursery_D and was rejected. However, since Nursery_D is still unmatched, it implies they failed to secure their higher priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C) or are still holding out.\nSince Nursery_D is the highest remaining option for me, I must re-apply persistently. I will emphasize my continued commitment, hoping that their remaining availability makes them more receptive to my application now, even after the initial rejection."

I have previously rejected Parent_E, but they have reapplied, showing strong commitment. My top choices (P_D and P_A) rank me last (5th), making a match highly improbable. Parent_C ranks me 3rd but is likely highly sought after by N_B and N_C. Since it is Round 4, and Parent_E ranks me 2nd, accepting this application secures a match and prevents me from risking being left unmatched while waiting for agents who are unlikely to choose me. This maximizes my utility given the constraints and market dynamics."
