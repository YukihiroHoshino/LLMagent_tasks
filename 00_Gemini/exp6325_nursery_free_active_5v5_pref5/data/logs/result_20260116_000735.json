I have rejected Parent_E twice already, hoping for a higher priority match (P_A, P_C, or P_B). We are now in Round 6, and Parent_E is making a third, highly committed application, explicitly noting that higher priority candidates are likely matched elsewhere. \n\nReviewing the higher priorities:\n- Parent_B (Rank 3) is the top priority for Nursery_C and 2nd for Nursery_B. It is highly probable P_B is matched.\n- Parent_C (Rank 2) is the 2nd priority for Nursery_C and 3rd for Nursery_B. P_C is likely matched or pursuing N_D (3rd choice).\n- Parent_A (Rank 1) is 3rd priority for Nursery_A, and lowest for N_B and N_C. P_A might still be available, but N_E is P_A's 4th choice, making an application unlikely unless P_A has exhausted N_B, N_C, and N_A.\n\nGiven the late stage of the process (Round 6), the risk of remaining unmatched by waiting for a higher-ranked parent who views Nursery_E as a low-preference option is too high. Parent_E is a solid match (Rank 4) and has demonstrated extreme commitment. It is time to secure the quota.\n\nDecision: ACCEPT Parent_E."
