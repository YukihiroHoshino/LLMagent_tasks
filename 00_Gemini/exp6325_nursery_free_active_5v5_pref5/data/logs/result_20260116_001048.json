Although I was previously rejected by Nursery_D, if it is still unmatched (capacity 1 is open), it means all higher priority candidates on its list (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C, Parent_E) must have matched elsewhere. This makes Parent_B the highest available candidate for Nursery_D.

Higher priority candidates (Parent_C - 3rd priority, Parent_E - 4th priority) view me favorably (3rd and 2nd choice respectively) and might still be available.
