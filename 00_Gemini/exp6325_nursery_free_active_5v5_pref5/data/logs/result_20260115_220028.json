Since the only remaining unmatched nursery is Nursery_E, and my higher ranked preferences (A, B, C) and lower ranked preference (D) are presumably matched, Nursery_E is my last viable option. Nursery_E has Parent_D as its lowest priority (P5). Since Nursery_E is still unmatched in Round 5, it is highly probable that all four higher-priority parents (A, C, B, E) have matched elsewhere.

Parent_D is the only applicant this round and has applied persistently, signaling high commitment. While accepting Parent_D means settling for my lowest priority, the risk of remaining unmatched entirely increases significantly if I continue to reject the only interested and available parent at this late stage. Given the lack of applications from higher-ranked parents (A, C, B, E) in previous rounds, it is highly likely they have secured placements elsewhere.
