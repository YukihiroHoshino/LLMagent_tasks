Parent_E has applied 5 times and been rejected, indicating Nursery_D was holding out for its higher priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C). Since Nursery_D is still unmatched in Round 6, it is highly likely that Parent_D, Parent_A, and Parent_C have secured spots elsewhere (as there are 4 other matched nurseries). This means Parent_E (4th priority) is now the highest available parent on Nursery_D's priority list. I must press this advantage with a formal application, acknowledging the history but emphasizing the current necessity for both parties to match."

Given that we are in Round 6 and Parent_E has applied persistently (5 times), it is highly probable that my top 3 candidates have already matched elsewhere. Parent_E ranks me 2nd overall, indicating strong commitment. If I continue to reject Parent_E, I risk going unmatched, as Parent_B (Rank 5) is my only remaining option, and they also applied once and were rejected.
