My quota is 1.\nIn this round, I received applications from Parent_E (Rank 4) and Parent_D (Rank 5). Parent_E is the highest ranked candidate currently applying.\nParents A, C, and B (Ranks 1, 2, 3) all rank Nursery_E as their 4th or 5th choice, meaning they are likely pursuing Nurseries B, C, and A first. Waiting for them carries significant risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept the lowest priority (Parent_D) later.\nSecuring a match at Rank 4 (Parent_E) is a strong outcome given the preferences of the higher-ranked parents. I will accept Parent_E."
