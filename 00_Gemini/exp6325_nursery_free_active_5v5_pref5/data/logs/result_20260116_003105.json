A and D are not in the 'List of nurseries not yet matched', implying they are also matched (or have binding offers). The only remaining active nursery is Nursery_E (my 4th preference).\n\nI have applied to Nursery_E twice and been rejected twice, indicating they are holding out for higher priority parents (A, C, B, E). Since it is Round 5 and Nursery_E is still open, it is highly likely that their top choices have committed elsewhere, or they would have matched already. \n\nI must press hard with a third formal application ([APPLY]), emphasizing immediate commitment, hoping that I am now the highest remaining priority candidate for Nursery_E."

Parent_D is my lowest priority (5th). I have rejected Parent_D twice already, and they are applying for the third time, indicating high desperation and commitment to me. While it is Round 5 and I still have 1 quota remaining, accepting the lowest priority parent now would prevent me from matching with Parent_A, C, B, or E if they become available in later rounds. Since Parent_D is extremely persistent, rejecting them again carries a lower risk of losing them permanently compared to losing the chance for a higher-ranked match. I will reject Parent_D again to hold out for a Parent ranked 1-4."

This means my top three preferences (B, C, A) and my lowest preference (D) are all matched.\nNursery_E is my 4th preference, and it is the only option left on my list. I have applied four times previously and been rejected, likely because I am the lowest priority applicant (5th) on Nursery_E's list.\nHowever, since Nursery_E is still unmatched in Round 6, it is highly probable that all parents ranked higher than me (Parent_A, C, B, E) have secured placements elsewhere.\nI must continue to press for an agreement.

I have continuously rejected Parent_D in previous rounds hoping for a higher-ranked Parent to apply or become available. However, Parent_D asserts that Nursery_E is the 'only remaining nursery in the market.' This strongly suggests that all higher-ranked candidates (A, C, B, E) have secured placements elsewhere, or they prefer remaining unmatched to applying to me. Since Parent_D is the last candidate on my list, and I prefer matching with anyone on the list over remaining empty, it is now strategically optimal to accept Parent_D to fill my quota before the simulation ends or the opportunity is lost.
