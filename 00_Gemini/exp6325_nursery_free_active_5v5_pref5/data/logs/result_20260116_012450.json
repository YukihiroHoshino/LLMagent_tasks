Parent_C (3rd priority, Rank 1 choice) and Parent_A (5th priority, Rank 1 choice) are likely to apply. Parent_C will secure the match, and I will be rejected.\n2. If I get rejected by N_B, I move to N_C (Rank 2) in Round 2. However, Parent_E (Rank 1 choice) is applying to N_C in Round 1. Parent_E is 4th priority at N_C, while I am 3rd priority. If I wait, P_E will likely secure N_C, as the matching is immediate and binding.\n\nTo maximize my outcome, I must secure my highest ranked nursery where I have a priority advantage over the highest-ranked applicant who is expected to apply there in Round 1.\n\nIf I apply to N_C (Rank 2), I compete mainly against P_E. Since Parent_D (3rd priority) beats Parent_E (4th priority) at N_C, applying directly to N_C guarantees a match with my second choice, preventing a catastrophic outcome (like matching with Rank 5, N_D, if N_B, N_A, N_C, N_E fill up quickly).\n\nTherefore, I will apply to Nursery_C to secure my Rank 2 choice."

Currently, only Nursery_D remains unmatched. Nursery_D is my 4th choice, making it still desirable. I previously applied to Nursery_D (Round X) and was rejected because they were prioritizing applicants higher on their list (Nursery_D's priority list puts Parent_B last). Since Nursery_D is still unmatched in Round 4, it means all the parents they preferred (P_D, P_A, P_C, P_E) must have matched elsewhere, or they rejected D. Given that D is the only remaining option, I must re-apply aggressively, emphasizing commitment and immediate acceptance, assuming D's preferred candidates are no longer available."

Since Nursery_D is still on Parent_B's list (Rank 4), Parent_B must secure this spot rather than risk remaining unmatched.

Since it is still only Round 5, there is a reasonable chance that Parent_C (my 3rd choice, who ranks me 3rd overall) or Parent_E (my 4th choice, who ranks me 2nd overall) are still available and might apply soon. My strategy remains to hold out for a higher priority match. I have rejected Parent_B twice already, and consistency requires rejecting them again to keep the spot open."

I have applied and been rejected by Nursery_D three times previously, as they prioritized candidates higher on their list (Parent D, A, C, E). Since all other nurseries (A, B, C, E) are now matched, it is highly probable that all parents preferred by Nursery_D (D, A, C, E) have matched elsewhere. Therefore, Parent_B (the lowest priority applicant for Nursery_D) is likely the highest remaining applicant available to them. Given this is the final opportunity for Parent_B to secure a match, I must submit a formal, highly committed application to Nursery_D, leveraging the fact that they are now unmatched and I guarantee acceptance."

Parent_B claims that Nursery_D is the only remaining available nursery for them, suggesting the market is highly constrained and likely nearing conclusion. I have rejected Parent_B multiple times previously, holding out for higher priority candidates (D, A, C, E). Since none of the higher priority parents have applied this round, and the process is significantly advanced, the probability that D, A, C, or E are still unmatched AND prefer me over being unmatched is low. Rejecting Parent_B now carries a high risk of remaining unmatched entirely. Therefore, securing the final quota with the available applicant, even if they are the lowest priority, is the optimal strategy at this stage."
