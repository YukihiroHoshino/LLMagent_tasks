Assuming P_B applies to N_A (P_B's Rank 1) and P_C applies to N_B (P_C's Rank 1), Nursery_C's highest priority applicant remaining would be me (P_D, 3rd priority).

Since we are only in Round 4, and none of my top three choices have secured a match with me yet, I need to continue holding out for a higher-ranked parent. Parent_E is highly persistent, having applied and been rejected previously, and applying again now. This persistence suggests they are serious about matching if their higher choices fall through, but it also indicates they are likely exhausting their top options (Nursery_C, D, A). If I accept Parent_E now, I forego the chance of matching with P1, P2, or P3. Given that Parent_E is also the 1st priority for Nursery_A, their persistence with me (4th choice) suggests Nursery_A might be matched or holding out, but I cannot rely on securing Parent_E later if I wait too long. However, maximizing priority is key. I will reject Parent_E again to keep my spot open for P1, P2, or P3, but I will maintain a polite tone to encourage them to reapply if necessary in later rounds."
