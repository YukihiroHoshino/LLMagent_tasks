My priority list is: ['Parent_D' (R1), 'Parent_A' (R2), 'Parent_C' (R3), 'Parent_E' (R4), 'Parent_B' (R5)]. Parent_C has applied [APPLY]. Parent_C is my Rank 3 choice. While I prefer R1 (Parent_D) and R2 (Parent_A), both of those parents rank Nursery_D as their last choice (R5). It is highly unlikely they will apply to me unless all other options fail. Parent_C, however, ranks me 3rd and has applied immediately, indicating high commitment now. Securing a match with a Rank 3 candidate early in Round 3 is strategically sound, mitigating the risk of being left unmatched while waiting for candidates who are unlikely to choose me. I will accept Parent_C."
