I previously applied to D and was rejected. However, since D is still unmatched in Round 4, it means their higher priority candidates (Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_C) have either matched elsewhere or D rejected them and is now potentially desperate or reviewing lower priorities.\n4. I am Parent_E, ranked 4th on D's priority list. Now is the time to re-apply strongly, emphasizing commitment and hoping D is willing to accept a candidate they previously overlooked, especially since D is the only option left for me among my top preferences.\n5. I must use the [APPLY] tag as this is my best remaining option."

I previously rejected Parent_E hoping for a higher-ranked match (D, A, or C). However, it is now Round 4, and I remain unmatched. Parent_D and Parent_A rank me last (Rank 5), making a match with them highly improbable. Parent_C ranks me 3rd, but they have not applied, suggesting they are still pursuing their higher preferences (Nursery_B or Nursery_C). Parent_E (Rank 4 for me, Rank 2 overall for them) has applied a second time, demonstrating strong commitment. Given the risk of remaining unmatched if I continue to wait for Parent_C, securing a committed match with Parent_E is the most prudent strategy at this stage of the allocation process."
