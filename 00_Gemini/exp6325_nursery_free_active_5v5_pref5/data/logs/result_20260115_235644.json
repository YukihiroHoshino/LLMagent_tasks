Parent_E (Rank 4) has submitted an immediate [APPLY] and states Nursery_C is their first choice. My top three parents (B, C, D) all rank Nursery_C lower (2nd or 3rd) and are highly likely to have applied to Nursery_A or Nursery_B in Round 1. Furthermore, Parent_E is the top priority for both Nursery_A and Nursery_B. If I reject Parent_E now, they will likely apply to Nursery_A (their 3rd choice, but N_A's 1st priority) in the next round and be accepted, leaving me potentially unmatched if B, C, and D are accepted by A or B. Given the high risk of ending up unmatched, and securing a Parent who is highly motivated (1st choice), accepting Parent_E (Rank 4) is the optimal strategy in this competitive first round."
