Since it is only Round 3, and I have high-priority candidates like Parent_E (2nd choice for them) and Parent_C (3rd choice for them) who might still be available, I must reject Parent_B to maximize my utility by keeping my slot open."

I assume A (Rank 3) is matched since it is not listed as available, leaving E and D as the only options.\n\nNursery_E (Rank 4) previously rejected my application, and I am the lowest priority (5th) on their list. Re-applying carries a high risk of rejection, although E is my highest remaining preference.\n\nNursery_D (Rank 5, my lowest preference) is still available. Crucially, I am the highest priority (1st) on Nursery_D's preference list: ['Parent_D', 'Parent_A', ...]. Applying to Nursery_D guarantees a match, securing an outcome rather than risking being unmatched or waiting indefinitely.\n\nGiven the strong rejections from higher preferences, securing a certain match now, even if it is my lowest preference, is the most strategic move to conclude the process successfully. I will apply formally to Nursery_D."

Nursery_E ranks me third (P_B). If the two parents preferred above me (P_A, P_C) are matched elsewhere, I become their top choice.\nSince N_D has already rejected me, applying there again is risky and likely to result in another rejection, wasting the round.
