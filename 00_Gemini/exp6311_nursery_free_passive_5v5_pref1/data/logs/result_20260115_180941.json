For literacy and numeracy, we employ continuous assessment, utilizing both formal benchmarks and observational records, to pinpoint each child's current developmental stage. Learning experiences are then differentiated. For instance, in literacy, some children might focus on phonemic awareness games, while others move toward early decoding or sight word recognition. Similarly, numeracy centers offer tiered activities, ensuring one child might explore sorting and patterning while another engages with basic addition concepts using manipulatives. This flexible, needs-based approach ensures every child is appropriately challenged and supported, moving at their optimal pace. Do you have any further questions regarding our assessment methods or how we integrate these skills into play?",
