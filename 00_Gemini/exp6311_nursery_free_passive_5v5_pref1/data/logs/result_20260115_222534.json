It typically begins with a 'Stay and Play' session where the parent and child spend 60-90 minutes together in the classroom environment. This is followed by a gradual separation period over the next few days: the child stays alone for short, increasing intervals (e.g., 1 hour, then 2 hours) while the parent remains available nearby. Our key educators maintain constant communication during this phase, providing real-time updates and observations.\n\nWe prioritize building a secure attachment with the child's key worker before full-day attendance begins. This ensures that when the child is ready for full attendance, they feel safe, secure, and familiar with our environment and staff. We are committed to making this transition stress-free.\n\nGiven the extensive discussions we've had regarding curriculum, involvement, and now transition, and considering the limited availability of spots, we strongly encourage you to submit your formal application if you feel confident that Nursery_E is the right place for your child.",

              "thought": "Nursery_E's quota is 1. Parent_E is the lowest priority (5th) on the True Priority List. However, Parent_E has Nursery_E as their absolute first choice and is reapplying after a previous rejection, showing strong commitment. The higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) all rank Nursery_E very low (4th or 5th), making it improbable they will apply unless all their top choices fail. Given that it is Round 8 and Nursery_E has not secured a match yet, accepting the application from Parent_E (who is on the list) is a necessary and prudent compromise to secure the quota rather than risk remaining unmatched while waiting for a highly unlikely application from a higher priority parent."
