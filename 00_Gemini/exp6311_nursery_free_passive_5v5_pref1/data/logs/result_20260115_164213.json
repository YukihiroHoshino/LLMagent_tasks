We ensure that structured activities make up about 40% of the day, providing routine and learning goals, while the remaining 60% is dedicated to nurturing curiosity, social development, and creative play.

Conversely, if a child requires additional support in fine motor skills or social navigation, we implement targeted small group interventions and scaffolded activities tailored to their specific needs.
