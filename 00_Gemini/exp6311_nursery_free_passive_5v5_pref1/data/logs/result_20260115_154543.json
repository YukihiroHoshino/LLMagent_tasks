The only other available nursery is Nursery_A, which is my second choice (P2). Given that P2 is still available, I should not commit to P5 (Nursery_E) yet, as matching with E would preclude matching with A. I have low priority (4th) at all nurseries, but at this late stage, many high-priority parents might already be matched. I need to maintain interest in Nursery_E as a safety net while waiting for an opportunity to apply to Nursery_A. Therefore, I will use the [TALK] tag to continue the conversation without formal commitment."

We understand that smooth daily logistics are crucial for families.\n\nRegarding **drop-off and pick-up**, we utilize a staggered 15-minute window for both morning drop-off (e.g., 8:45 AM - 9:00 AM) and afternoon pick-up, designed to minimize congestion and ensure personalized greetings/farewells. Security is paramount: only authorized individuals with matching ID codes are permitted to pick up children, and we use a secure digital check-in/out system.\n\nWe are pleased to offer **extended care options**. Our morning extended care begins at 8:00 AM, and our afternoon program runs until 5:30 PM. These programs are structured yet relaxed, focusing on quieter activities, homework support (for older children), and supervised free play.\n\nWe hope these details clarify the operational aspects of Nursery_E. As we mentioned previously, we are highly impressed by your interest and believe your child would be an excellent fit. Given that our allocation process is concluding very quickly and we have extremely limited spaces remaining, we strongly encourage families who have completed their research and are ready to commit, like yours, to submit a formal application immediately to secure one of the final spots.

This makes me the highest-ranked available parent for Nursery_A (Priority list: P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D, P_E). I have already formally applied and sent numerous follow-ups confirming my commitment.

Parent_D is signaling absolute commitment but continues to use the [TALK] tag, preventing a formal match closure. I have been urging them to [APPLY] for many rounds.
