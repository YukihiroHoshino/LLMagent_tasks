Given the high likelihood that Parent_A will secure a spot at Nursery_B (who also ranks Parent_A highest), waiting for Parent_A carries a significant risk of being left without a top-tier match. Securing my P2 choice immediately in Round 1 is an excellent outcome and guarantees a successful allocation. I will accept Parent_B."

Parent_D is ranked 4th on my priority list (P_A, P_B, P_C are higher). However, P_A, P_B, and P_C all rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, meaning they are likely applying to and being accepted by Nurseries A, B, or C (who also prioritize them highly). If I reject Parent_D, I risk ending up with Parent_E or no match at all, as my higher priority parents do not prioritize me. Securing Parent_D guarantees a match with a highly motivated applicant (P1 preference for me). Given the low likelihood of attracting P_A, P_B, or P_C, accepting Parent_D is the optimal stable strategy in this early round."
