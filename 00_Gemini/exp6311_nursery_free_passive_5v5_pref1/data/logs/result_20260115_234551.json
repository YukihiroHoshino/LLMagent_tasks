I need to keep the conversation positive and informative to maintain options, but I should not encourage an immediate application, as I would prefer to wait for Parent_B, or potentially Parent_A/C if they somehow become available later, though they are likely matched.

Given that D is my last choice and I am Nursery_D's lowest priority (Parent_E is 5th), applying immediately is strategically poor if I still have a chance at E or A.
