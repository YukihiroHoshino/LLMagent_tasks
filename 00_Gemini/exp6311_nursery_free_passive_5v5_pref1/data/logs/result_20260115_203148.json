While Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_C are higher on my list, they all prioritize other nurseries highly (Nursery_A, B, C). Given that my quota is 1 and I am not a highly preferred choice for my top priorities, rejecting a guaranteed match (P4 on my list, P1 for them) in Round 1 carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched later.

While Parent_A and Parent_B are higher, it is Round 1, and Parent_C is applying directly, indicating a strong commitment (Nursery_C is their 1st choice).

In Round 1, it is highly likely that higher priority parents (A, B, D, and especially B who ranks N_A first) will be applying to their top choices, including N_A.
