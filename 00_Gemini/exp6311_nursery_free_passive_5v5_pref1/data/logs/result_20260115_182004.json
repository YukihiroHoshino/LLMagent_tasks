Parent_A previously withdrew interest. Parent_B is matched. Parent_C and Parent_D rank me as their 5th choice, meaning they are very unlikely to apply to me unless they are rejected by all four higher-ranked schools. Parent_E, however, ranks me as their 1st choice and has submitted a committed [APPLY]. Given the low likelihood of attracting or matching with my higher priority parents (P_C and P_D) who have much stronger preferences elsewhere, securing a stable match now with Parent_E, who is highly motivated, is the optimal strategy to fulfill my quota."
