We utilize a phased entry system, allowing new children to attend for shorter periods initially, gradually increasing their time as they settle. Crucially, every new entrant is assigned a 'Key Worker' who serves as the primary point of contact for the family and ensures consistent emotional support, helping the child build trust and familiarity quickly.
