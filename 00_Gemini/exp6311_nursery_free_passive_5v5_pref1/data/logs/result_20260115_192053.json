Parent_E is the only unmatched parent and is rank 5/5 on Nursery_C's priority list. While Parent_E is low priority, securing this match is necessary to fill the quota and successfully conclude the market, which is preferable to remaining unmatched. Parent_E has repeatedly confirmed unconditional acceptance but continues to use the [TALK] tag. I must maintain the consistent strategy: acknowledge their readiness, emphasize the necessity of the match for market closure, and explicitly instruct them to use the [APPLY] tag, upon which immediate acceptance will follow. Since the Parent used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."
