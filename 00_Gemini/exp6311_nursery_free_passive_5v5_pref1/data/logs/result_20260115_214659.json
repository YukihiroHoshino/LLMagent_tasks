This is balanced by dedicated time for movement, communal meals, quiet reflection/story time, and, crucially, significant periods spent outdoors utilizing our natural exploration zones, regardless of the weather. The pace is intentionally unhurried to allow for meaningful learning.\n\nRegarding the ratios, we are proud to maintain staffing levels that ensure personalized attention: we adhere to a 1:4 ratio for our youngest children and a 1:6 ratio for our preschool groups.
