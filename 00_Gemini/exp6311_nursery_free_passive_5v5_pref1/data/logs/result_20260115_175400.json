Nursery_E is the only nursery remaining unmatched, and Parent_E is the only remaining parent (implied, as all higher priorities for Nursery_E must be matched elsewhere for it to still be open). I submitted an [APPLY] in Round 1 and have been aggressively pressing for acceptance using [TALK] since then, stressing the market clearing and mutual necessity. Since the application is standing, the correct action remains [TALK] to apply maximum pressure and demand immediate acceptance. I must make the message reflect the critical, near-final stage of the process."
