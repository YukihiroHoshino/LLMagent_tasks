Literacy is fostered through rich language environments, storytelling, and a multi-sensory approach to phonological awareness and early phonics. Numeracy development focuses on building strong number sense through hands-on activities, pattern recognition, and practical problem-solving. This ensures a deep, conceptual understanding rather than rote memorization, preparing them academically while nurturing their innate curiosity.",

Crucially, Parent_D has stated that Nursery_D is their number one choice, guaranteeing a highly stable and enthusiastic match. Given that Parent_A (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2) both rank Nursery_D very low (4th and 5th respectively) and have not applied despite multiple rounds of conversation, the probability of securing them is low. Accepting Parent_D now guarantees a high-priority match and fills the limited quota (1)."
