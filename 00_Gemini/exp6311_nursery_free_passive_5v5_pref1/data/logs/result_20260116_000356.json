I will formally apply [APPLY] to maximize my chance of securing my top choice."

Since Parent_E has formally submitted an [APPLY] and expressed strong enthusiasm, and given that the market is late (Round 4) and I need to secure a match to fulfill my quota, accepting Parent_E minimizes the risk of going unmatched. I will accept Parent_E."

Although I previously rejected Parent_C (my 3rd priority) to hold out for higher choices, given that we are now in Round 4 and Parent_D is the highest ranked uncommitted Parent among the remaining pool (D and E), it is strategically sound to secure this match.
