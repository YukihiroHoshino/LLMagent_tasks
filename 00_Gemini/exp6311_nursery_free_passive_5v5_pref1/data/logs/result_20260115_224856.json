Although I am the lowest priority (P5) on Nursery_E's list, in Round 4, with only two nurseries (A and E) remaining, the distribution of higher-priority parents (A, C, D) to B, C, D is highly likely. The only remaining high-priority parent is P_B, who prefers N_A (P1 for B) over N_E (P4 for B). If P_B applies to N_A, N_A will accept them (P_B is the highest remaining priority for N_A), leaving N_E available for me.
