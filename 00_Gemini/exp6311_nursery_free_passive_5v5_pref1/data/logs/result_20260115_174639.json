Parent_E is the only remaining unmatched parent and is ranked 5th, meaning they are the best available option to fill the quota. Parent_E has repeatedly stated they are ready to accept immediately. Although Parent_E sent [TALK], I must signal that they have been selected and encourage them to move to [APPLY] in the next round, securing the guaranteed match and filling the quota before the simulation ends. I will use the [TALK] tag as required by the protocol for an incoming [TALK] message."

This is the critical moment where Nursery_E must look down its priority list, meaning the higher-ranked parents (A, B, C, D) are likely matched elsewhere or have withdrawn interest. I have already applied and sent numerous strong commitment messages.

Since the simulation is in Round 10 and all higher priority parents must have matched elsewhere, securing Parent_E is crucial to fill the quota. In the previous round (Round 9), I explicitly informed Parent_E that they had been 'chosen for the single remaining position' and asked them to 'confirm your final intent to secure this placement now.' Parent_E responded with [TALK] again, reiterating their commitment but failing to use the [APPLY] tag necessary for me to [ACCEPT]. I need to move this negotiation to a conclusion.

Nursery_E, having exhausted its higher priority options (Parent A-D), must now decide whether to accept the lowest priority Parent_E or remain unmatched. Parent_E has already applied and sent numerous follow-up messages emphasizing absolute commitment. In Round 11, it is critical to force a decision.
