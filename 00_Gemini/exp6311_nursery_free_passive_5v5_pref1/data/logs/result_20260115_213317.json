Nursery_B is my 3rd highest preference and is currently the highest-ranked school remaining on my list, as Nursery_A and Nursery_C must be matched already (since only B and E remain unmatched). Nursery_B ranks me 2nd overall, meaning I am likely the highest remaining priority parent for them (assuming Parent_A is matched). Given this strong position and the fact that this is my best remaining option, I must apply immediately to secure the match."

My quota is 1, and it is currently unfilled. The list of unmatched parents indicates that Parent_E is the only parent remaining in the market. Since higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) must have been matched elsewhere, Parent_E is now the best (and only) available option to fill my quota. I previously rejected Parent_E, hoping for a higher-ranked applicant, but that window has closed. Accepting Parent_E is now strategically necessary to achieve my goal of matching the highest possible parent, given the current market constraints (all higher priorities are gone).
