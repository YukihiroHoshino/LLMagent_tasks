Given my low priority (3rd) at all nurseries, I need to reserve my application for higher-ranked schools unless the market forces me to compromise. I have already engaged in two rounds of conversation with Nursery_E. I will continue to signal polite interest by using [TALK] to keep the option open, but I will not apply yet, as applying to my last choice now would be premature and potentially limit my ability to pursue better matches later."
