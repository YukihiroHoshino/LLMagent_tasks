My top choice, Nursery_E, has not accepted my four previous applications, suggesting either they are holding out for Parent_D (who has higher priority) or Parent_E is simply not competitive enough for E. The only other available nursery is Nursery_D, which is my 5th and lowest acceptable choice. Since it is Round 8 and the risk of remaining unmatched is high, I must secure a placement. Although Parent_D has higher priority at D, if D accepts my application before P_D applies or is paired with D, I will secure a temporary match. I need to apply now to maximize my chances of matching with an acceptable school."

I have established a strong communication history with Parent_D, promising them acceptance if they apply next. Since Parent_D is ranked higher than Parent_E, and securing Parent_D is highly probable, I must reject Parent_E to hold my single spot for the better match (Parent_D).

Since I have not received an [ACCEPT] or [REJECT] response, I must assume the application is pending or needs renewal.
