We have been deeply impressed by your commitment and the perfect alignment of our educational philosophies with your family values. Your clear articulation that Nursery E is your absolute first preference has been noted throughout this process. We are now pleased to inform you that we have completed our final review and are delighted to offer you the remaining placement at Nursery E. We look forward to welcoming your family into our community immediately.",
              "thought": "Parent_E is ranked 5th on my priority list (Parent_A > Parent_B > Parent_C > Parent_D > Parent_E). While they are the lowest ranked, they are still a desired match, and they have demonstrated absolute, unwavering commitment, ranking Nursery_E as their undisputed first choice. I have rejected them twice already in hopes of securing a match with Parent_A, B, C, or D. However, in Round 9, none of the higher-ranked parents have formally applied or committed. Parent_C and Parent_D are still only engaging in general conversation. Given that I only have one quota, and Parent_E is highly enthusiastic and a guaranteed stable match, continuing to hold out risks losing Parent_E to another nursery and potentially ending the simulation unmatched. Securing my lowest preference is better than failing to fill the quota. I will accept Parent_E now."
