This suggests they might match with their higher preferences first, leaving Nursery_D available.

Given that Parents A, B, and C all rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, their chances of matching with their higher-ranked schools (Nursery A, B, or C) are high. Therefore, holding out for a Parent who is unlikely to apply to me risks leaving my single quota unfilled.
