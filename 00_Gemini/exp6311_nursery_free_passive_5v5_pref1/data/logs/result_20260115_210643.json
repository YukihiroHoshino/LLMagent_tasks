However, the available parents are Parent_D (P4) and Parent_E (P5). Parent_E has applied twice and ranks me as their first choice, demonstrating high commitment. Parent_D, though slightly higher on my list, has only engaged in conversation and ranks me 5th overall, suggesting low commitment to Nursery_E. Since the market is nearly depleted and I risk ending up unmatched if I continue rejecting the only applicant, securing Parent_E guarantees filling my quota. I will accept Parent_E now, as waiting for Parent_D carries significant risk of losing both parents."
