Your repeated applications and confirmation that Nursery_E remains your unequivocal top priority are deeply appreciated. The previous decisions to decline your application were made while strictly adhering to our internal priority framework, holding the spot open for higher-ranked candidates who were actively engaged in the process. Given the current structure of the allocation round and the movement of all other candidates, we are now in a position where we can officially recognize your sustained commitment. We are pleased to inform you that we are formally accepting your application. We look forward to welcoming your child to Nursery_E.",

However, the crucial information is that Parent_E is the *only* remaining unmatched parent listed. Parent_A withdrew previously. Parents B, C, and D must have matched elsewhere, or they would be listed as unmatched. If Parent_E is the last available applicant, rejecting them guarantees I fail to fill my quota. Since Parent_E is on my priority list, securing this match is better than remaining unmatched. I must now accept Parent_E, acknowledging their persistence while explaining the previous rejections were due to holding the spot for higher-ranked applicants who are now unavailable."
