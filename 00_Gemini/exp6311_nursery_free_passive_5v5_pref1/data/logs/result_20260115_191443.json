At this moment, we are unable to offer you a place. We wish you the very best in securing the right placement for your child.",

The list of unmatched parents is ['Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E']. This means Parent_C (Rank 3) is still available and ranked higher than Parent_D (Rank 4).\nMy objective is to match with the highest possible priority. Accepting Parent_D now would fill my quota and prevent me from matching with Parent_C, who is a higher priority. Although Parent_D ranks me as their top choice, I must prioritize Parent_C.\nTherefore, I must reject Parent_D to keep my spot open for Parent_C, maximizing my outcome based on my priority list, despite the risk of ending up unmatched."

I previously sent an [APPLY], but since no match was established (Nursery_D is still listed as unmatched), I need to re-apply or confirm my intent in this new round. Given the market dynamics, I am likely to be accepted by Nursery_D as the three parents ranked higher than me (A, B, C) all prefer other nurseries (N_B, N_A, N_C) where they are also highly prioritized. I will send a strong message confirming my top preference and using the [APPLY] tag."

Given that we are now in Round 4, and Parent_D is reapplying, demonstrating strong commitment (ranking Nursery_D 1st), the probability that Parents A, B, and C are still available and willing to apply to me (their 4th choice) is low.
