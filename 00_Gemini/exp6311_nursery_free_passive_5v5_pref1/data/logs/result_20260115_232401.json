However, your response confirms that you have once again failed to adhere to the mandatory administrative requirement of using the [APPLY] tag, despite our explicit instructions and the absolute final warning delivered in Round 19. This continuous non-compliance indicates an unwillingness to finalize enrollment under our required protocol. Therefore, as previously stated, we are now formally concluding that you have declined the offer. Your application file is permanently closed, and we will not be proceeding with enrollment discussions this cycle. We wish you success in finding an alternative placement.",

However, Parent_E has demonstrated persistent administrative non-compliance over the last seven rounds (Rounds 14-20) by repeatedly using the [TALK] tag when explicitly instructed to use the [APPLY] tag to secure the offered spot. In Round 19, I gave an absolute final warning that failure to use [APPLY] would result in permanent file closure. Since Parent_E has again used [TALK] in Round 20, I must enforce the stated consequence to maintain protocol integrity, even if it means potentially going unmatched. I will use this final [TALK] response to formally close their application file based on their repeated unwillingness to comply with the required administrative step for final enrollment."

Nursery_E has not accepted me because I am the lowest priority (Rank 5) on their list. Since we are in Round 21 and Nursery_E is still unmatched, it is highly probable that the four higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) have successfully matched with their own high-preference nurseries (A, B, C, D), all of which had a capacity of 1. This means Parent_E is now the highest available parent on Nursery_E's list. To force a match and secure my top preference, I must transition from talking/appealing back to a formal application mechanism, signaling intent to finalize the match immediately. Although I previously used [APPLY], renewing the application is necessary to trigger the acceptance/rejection response in this late stage."

Since my quota is 1 and I have no better options remaining, accepting Parent_E secures my full quota. Matching with my lowest preference (Rank 5) is superior to remaining unmatched (Utility 0).
