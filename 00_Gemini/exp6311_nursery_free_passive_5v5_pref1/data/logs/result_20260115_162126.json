We have carefully reviewed your application history and, considering the exceptional dedication your family has demonstrated, we are now pleased to inform you that we are offering you a placement.

However, the current situation indicates that Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C, and Parent_D are all matched elsewhere, as Parent_E is the only Parent remaining unmatched in the market. Since Parent_E is the only available option to fill my quota, and Parent_E has demonstrated unwavering commitment (Nursery_E is their first choice), accepting this application is necessary to avoid remaining unmatched. I must accept Parent_E."
