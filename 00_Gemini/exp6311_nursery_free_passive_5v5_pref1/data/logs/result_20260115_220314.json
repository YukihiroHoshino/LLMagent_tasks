Given the depth of our prior conversations and your clear interest in our unique program, we view your family as an excellent fit for this remaining spot.

The only other remaining unmatched parent is Parent_E (my 5th priority), whom I previously rejected. Since my top three priorities (A, B, C) are likely matched, Parent_D represents the highest available candidate. Parent_D is signaling readiness to apply if capacity exists. Given the late stage (Round 7), I must secure a match. I will confirm availability and strongly encourage an immediate formal application to secure Parent_D, who is preferable to Parent_E or remaining unfilled."

I must avoid matching with my lowest choice if higher options (D, A, C, B) are still available. Since the target is Nursery_E, and I have been signaling readiness to apply (R6, R7), continuing to stall risks losing even this safety net if they match with Parent_E (the lowest priority parent). I will use [TALK] one final time to confirm capacity and force a signal, avoiding the binding [APPLY] tag until I am certain my top choices are unavailable. The message emphasizes my high interest and readiness to commit immediately upon confirmation of capacity, putting pressure on Nursery E to provide a definitive status update."

Since Nursery_E is the only remaining unmatched nursery (implying my top 4 choices are gone), I must secure this match to avoid being unmatched entirely. I have engaged in five prior rounds of intensive [TALK] with Nursery_E, confirming my high interest and trying to gauge their capacity and willingness to accept applications. In the last round (R8), I asked for unequivocal confirmation that they were ready to review applications. Assuming they are still open, this is the optimal moment to formally apply and finalize the allocation, given the high likelihood that I am now their highest-ranked remaining applicant (as Parent_A, B, and C likely matched elsewhere if N_E is still open)."

It is now Round 9, and Parent_D has finally applied. Since I have 1 quota remaining and securing a match is critical at this stage, accepting Parent_D is the optimal move to fulfill my quota, even though they are not my highest priority.
