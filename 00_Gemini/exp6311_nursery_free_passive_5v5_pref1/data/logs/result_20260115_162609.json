My 2nd choice (Nursery_A) is not available this round. Therefore, I must proceed to my 3rd choice, Nursery_C, to secure a match, as waiting further carries risk. Nursery_C ranks me 4th (behind A, B, C), so I need to apply now while they are unmatched and hoping to secure a spot before higher-priority parents apply or the market stabilizes.

I previously rejected Parent_C and Parent_E, holding out for a better match (A or B). Since A and B are gone, Parent_C is now the most desirable remaining candidate.
