The remaining available nurseries are Nursery_B (1st pref) and Nursery_D (4th pref). I am the top priority for both D and B. Since B is my highest preference and still available, I must prioritize securing B if possible. Applying to D now (4th preference) would secure a match but eliminate the chance of matching with B later. Since I am the top priority for D, I can afford to continue talking to maintain interest without committing.

Afternoons focus on thematic project work, quiet time, and specialized enrichment. Regarding enrichment, we offer weekly sessions in Music & Movement, Spanish language introduction, and a specialized 'Nature Explorers' program utilizing our dedicated outdoor learning space. We design the schedule to ensure both routine and stimulation, supporting optimal development. We hope this insight is helpful in your decision-making process.",
