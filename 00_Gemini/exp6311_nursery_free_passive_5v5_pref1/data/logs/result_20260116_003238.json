Since Nursery_D has capacity 1 and I am on their preference list, they will accept me if I am the applicant in this conversation, regardless of my low priority, as long as they don't have a prior match. Since it's Round 1, they are unmatched. While Nursery_D is Rank 1 for Parent_D, Parent_D might be paired elsewhere this round. If I wait, I risk Parent_D matching with Nursery_D later, leaving me without my Rank 5 option.

Therefore, I will use the [TALK] action to maintain engagement and gather general information without committing to an application."
