Since Nursery_A (Rank 3) and Nursery_B (Rank 2) are still unmatched, I should prioritize keeping those options open or waiting for better opportunities. Applying to Nursery_E now would lock me into my worst choice, especially since I am 3rd priority and might still lose out if Parent_A or Parent_B apply later. I should use [TALK] to remain engaged and gather basic information without signaling strong commitment or making an application."

We utilize our extensive, secure outdoor playground which features a variety of equipment designed for different age groups, including climbing structures, swings, and natural play areas. For days when the weather prevents outdoor play, we utilize our large indoor 'Movement Room,' which is equipped for structured gross motor activities, ensuring consistency in physical development regardless of the conditions.
