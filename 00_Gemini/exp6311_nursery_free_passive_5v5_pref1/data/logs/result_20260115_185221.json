We are proud of our program and are happy to elaborate on these key areas.\n\nRegarding **Early Literacy Development**, our approach is deeply rooted in play-based learning and phonological awareness. We don't rush formal reading; instead, we build the essential foundational skills. This involves daily activities like interactive storytelling, rhyming games, sound exploration (phonics through play), and emergent writing centers where children express ideas through drawing and early letter forms. We integrate literacy across all subjects—for example, reading recipes during cooking activities or writing observations during nature walks. Our goal is to foster a lifelong love of language and communication.\n\nAs for **Parent Involvement**, we structure it to be supportive and flexible. We host quarterly literacy and development workshops for parents, offering tools and insights into supporting learning at home. We also maintain an 'open classroom' policy for scheduled volunteer opportunities, allowing parents to share their unique skills or cultural backgrounds. Crucially, we use a dedicated communication app for daily updates and two formal parent-teacher conferences annually, ensuring a strong, collaborative partnership throughout the year.
