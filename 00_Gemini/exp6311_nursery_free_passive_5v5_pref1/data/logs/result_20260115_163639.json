We are in Round 6 and remain unmatched, with only one quota remaining. Parent_E is highly committed, ranking Nursery_E as their first choice and applying for the third time. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched if I continue to hold out for a parent who doesn't prefer me, it is strategically sound to secure Parent_E now, as they are a guaranteed match and are still on my priority list.
