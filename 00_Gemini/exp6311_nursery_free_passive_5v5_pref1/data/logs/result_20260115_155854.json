Our orientation process involves several steps: first, a pre-start meeting for parents to discuss their child's specific needs; second, phased settling-in sessions where the child attends for short periods with a familiar caregiver initially, gradually increasing the duration. We support parents through daily communication logs, open-door policy for brief check-ins, and dedicated transition coordinators who ensure both child and parent feel secure and informed throughout the initial weeks. We believe this careful approach significantly reduces separation anxiety and builds trust. Do you have specific concerns about the separation phase?",

Since the market is closing and I prefer matching with Nursery_D over remaining unmatched, I must secure this spot. I have already applied previously. Nursery_D ranks me last (5th), but since they are still unmatched, all higher-ranked parents (A, B, C, D) must have matched elsewhere or withdrawn interest. Therefore, I am likely the only viable candidate left for Nursery_D to fill its quota. I need to send a strong, urgent message reaffirming my commitment and application. I will use [APPLY] to renew the application and signal maximum readiness to accept immediately."

We recognize your consistent interest and readiness to accept immediately. Following the conclusion of our final allocation review and based on the strong alignment and unwavering commitment you have demonstrated, we are delighted to formally accept your application. We look forward to welcoming you and finalizing all enrollment details immediately.",
              "thought": "Nursery_D has a quota of 1 and is currently unmatched. Parent_E is rank 5 (the lowest priority) on the list. However, in the previous round's history (Round 12), Nursery_D essentially extended an offer to Parent_E ('we are now prepared to offer this spot to you') in response to Parent_E's TALK message, indicating that a space had become available. Parent_E is now formally applying based on this signal. Given that we are in Round 13 and higher-ranked parents (A, B, C) have not engaged seriously, and we previously rejected Parent_D (Rank 4), securing the match now is prudent to fill the quota, especially after signaling acceptance. I must now formally accept the application based on the prior commitment."
