Weekly, teachers send home detailed newsletters outlining upcoming themes and suggestions for extending learning at home. We also schedule formal one-on-one conferences twice a year, but we maintain an open-door policy for informal check-ins.\n\nFor parent involvement, we foster community through various means: monthly 'Family Learning Days' where parents are invited to participate in classroom activities; regular workshops focused on topics like positive discipline and developmental milestones; and an active Parent Association that organizes social events and supports school initiatives. We strive for a partnership where families feel deeply connected to the daily life and progress of their child. Do these communication methods sound aligned with your family's needs?",
