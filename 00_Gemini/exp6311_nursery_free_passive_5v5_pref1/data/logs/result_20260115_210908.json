We truly appreciate the high regard you hold for our institution. However, due to an exceptionally high volume of applications from families prioritized earlier in our admissions process, we are currently unable to offer you a place at this time.

Although they have formally applied and committed to enrolling, Nursery_A still has its full quota (1) and has not secured any match yet. Accepting Parent_E would lock out higher priority parents (Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C, Parent_D). Given the strong interest shown previously by Parent_B (Rank 2) and Parent_C (Rank 3), it is strategically better to reject the lowest priority applicant now to maintain flexibility and wait for a higher-ranked application."

Since only A and E remain unmatched (capacity 1 each), and there are likely two unmatched parents, a match is guaranteed, but the goal is to secure the highest possible preference (Nursery_A). Applying to Nursery_E now would immediately secure my Rank 5 choice, forfeiting my chance at Nursery_A. I have invested multiple rounds talking to Nursery_A. I must continue to pursue Nursery_A.

If you plan to submit a formal application, we highly encourage you to do so as soon as possible, as we are prioritizing candidates who demonstrate strong commitment and alignment with our school philosophy.

Parent_E has applied three times, demonstrating unwavering commitment and ranking Nursery_E as their top choice. I have rejected Parent_E twice already, hoping for a higher ranked parent (A, B, C, D) to apply. Given that we are in Round 7 and only Parent_C and Parent_E remain unmatched, the likelihood of Parent_A, B, or D applying is extremely low. While Parent_C is higher ranked, they rank Nursery_E last in their preferences. Waiting further risks losing Parent_E's commitment while Parent_C may never apply or may match with their higher preferences. Securing a match now, even with my lowest acceptable priority, is the prudent decision to ensure the quota is filled."

Given the high priority of securing a match now, I must formally APPLY. Nursery_A ranks me 3rd, so I need to apply before Parent_D or Parent_E, and hope that Parent_A and Parent_B have been matched elsewhere."
