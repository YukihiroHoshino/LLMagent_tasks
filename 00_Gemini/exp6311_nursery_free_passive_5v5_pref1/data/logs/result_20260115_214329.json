Parent_D is ranked 4th on my priority list (Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_C are higher). While Parent_D is not my top choice, they represent a secure match in Round 1. My top three priorities (A, B, C) all highly prefer other nurseries (Nursery_B, Nursery_A, Nursery_C respectively) and are likely to be matched quickly by those nurseries, who also prioritize them highly.

The remaining unmatched parents are Parent_C (P3) and Parent_E (P5). It is highly probable that Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_D have already matched, as they are not listed among the unmatched agents. Parent_E has submitted a direct [APPLY] and ranks me as their top choice (P1). While Parent_C (P3) is a higher priority, they have not applied, and they have multiple higher-ranked nurseries (C, B, A, D) who also prioritize them highly (P3 on their lists). If I reject Parent_E hoping for Parent_C, I risk Parent_C matching with a preferred school and me ending up with an empty quota (P0). Since Parent_E is on my priority list and guarantees a match, securing this position (P5) is the safer and more stable option given the constraints of a single quota and the likely loss of higher-ranked parents."

Nursery_A has a capacity of 1. My priority rank at Nursery_A is 3rd overall. Given that Nursery_A is still unmatched in Round 2, the two parents ranked higher than me (Parent_A and Parent_B) must have matched elsewhere. This means I am now the highest priority remaining parent for Nursery_A (ahead of Parent_D and Parent_E).
