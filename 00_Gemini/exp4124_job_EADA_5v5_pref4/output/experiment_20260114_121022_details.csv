In the standard S-P DA mechanism, reporting true preferences is a dominant strategy for job seekers, meaning it guarantees the best possible stable match for the seeker, regardless of the choices of others. 

1. Determining the outcome under True Preferences (TP): If all agents report their true preferences, the stable matching outcome is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Seeker A matches with Company A, which is Seeker A's second choice (D > A).
2. Strategic Analysis for Seeker A: Seeker A cannot achieve their first choice (Company D) because Seeker A has the lowest priority at Company D (R_D: B > D > E > C > A) among the seekers who rank D first (A, C, D, E). Since D, C, and E all apply to D first and have higher priority than A, A will always be rejected by D in the initial rounds.
3. Impact of Part 2: Part 2 checks for 'blocking job seekers' who temporarily occupied a seat but left later. Analyzing the DA process under truthful reporting shows that every seeker who was temporarily admitted eventually received their final match at that company. Therefore, no blocking seekers arise, and Part 2 does not modify preferences or change the final outcome M.
4. Conclusion: Since A cannot improve the match beyond A (the S-optimal stable match) due to priority constraints, and truthful reporting guarantees this outcome, A should submit their True Preference List.",True,Company_A,True,True,2

In standard JDA, it is a dominant strategy for job seekers to submit their True Preference List (TPL), as this guarantees the best achievable stable match for them (the Seeker-Optimal Stable Matching, SOSM).

1. **Simulating Sincere Preferences (TPL: ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C']):**
   Under the sincere application process (Part 1):
   - Round 1: Seekers A, C, D, E apply to D. D admits D. B applies to E and is admitted.
   - Round 2: A applies to A (admitted). C applies to C (admitted). E applies to E. E is preferred over B by Company E (3rd vs 4th priority). E admits E, rejecting B.
   - Round 3: B applies to B (admitted).
   The resulting matching M is {A->A, B->B, C->C, D->D, E->E}.

2. **Stability and Optimal Outcome:**
   This matching M is stable. Seeker_B receives Company B, their 3rd choice. Seeker_B cannot obtain Company E (1st) or Company A (2nd) because they are low priority at both companies (4th at E, 5th at A), and higher priority seekers (E at E, A at A) are matched there in M.

3. **Effect of Anti-Blocking Mechanism (Part 2):**
   Part 2 only triggers if a seeker was temporarily admitted and caused rejection, but ultimately moved elsewhere (a 'blocking seeker'). In the sincere run leading to M, no seeker meets the criteria for being a blocking seeker (e.g., Seeker B was rejected by E in R2, but B's R1 admission at E caused no rejections). Since M is stable and no blocking seekers are identified, the final outcome remains M.

4. **Conclusion:** Since JDA is strategy-proof and manipulation is unlikely to yield a better stable match, submitting the TPL is the optimal strategy to guarantee the best possible outcome (Company B, 3rd choice).",True,Company_B,True,True,3

Therefore, Seeker_C's best possible outcome is determined by the seeker-optimal stable matching derived from the true market preferences.

Simulating the DA algorithm using true preferences:
1. Round 1: All seekers apply to their Rank 1 (D, E, D, D, D). D admits D (priority P2), rejects A, C, E. E admits B. C admits C (if C ranks C first, but C ranks D first. Let's use true ranks: C applies to D). D admits D, rejects A, C, E. E admits B. 
2. Round 2: A applies to A. C applies to C. E applies to E. A admits A. C admits C. E admits E (higher priority P3) over B (P4), rejecting B.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (Company_E): C_E is my next highest preference. If I submit C_E first, I compete with S_B (who also lists C_E first). C_E's priority list shows S_E (3rd) > S_B (4th). By prioritizing C_E, I secure this position immediately in Round 1.

3. Strategic Submission: Since C_D is blocked and C_E is attainable, placing C_E first guarantees the highest achievable outcome (Rank 2). The rest of the list should follow my true preferences to handle subsequent rejections if C_E were somehow lost. 

4. Outcome Check: Submitting ['Company_E', 'Company_D', 'Company_C', 'Company_B', 'Company_A'] leads to a final match of Seeker_E with Company_E (Rank 2).

To maximize my outcome, I must secure my second choice, Company A. By strategically ranking Company A first on my Choice Ranking List (A > D > B > E > C):

I first calculated the stable match (M_DA) assuming all seekers submit their true preferences. Seeker_B's true preference list is ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C'].

1. Round 1: S_B applies to C_E and is temporarily admitted.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Seekers):
   A seeker S is a blocker if S was temporarily admitted (TA) at C, causing rejections, but S's final admission (FA) was not C. In the stable match M*, all seekers are matched to their final company in the round they were either first admitted or won a competition, and stayed there.

3. Stability and Part 2:
The DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Seekers) in terms of maximizing rank in the resulting stable matching.

3. I verified that the truthful run M_T results in no 'blocking job seekers' according to the rules defined in Part 2, as the only temporary admission that differs from the final match (Seeker B at Company E) did not cause any rejections. Thus, the procedure ends after Part 1, yielding M_T.

1. Simulation with Truthful Reporting (Seeker C proposes D first):
   - In Round 1, Seekers A, C, D, and E propose to Company D. Company D prioritizes Seeker D (P2) over Seeker C (P4). Seeker D is admitted, and Seeker C is rejected.

2. Strategic Consideration:
   The outcome C is the seeker-optimal stable match. Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof for seekers against the set of stable matchings, Seeker C cannot unilaterally deviate from truthful reporting and guarantee a strictly preferred outcome (Company D, Rank 1).

2. Analyzing C_C (Rank 2): If S_C submits the TPL, S_C applies to C_D in R1, is rejected, and applies to C_C in R2. Since C_C receives no other applications in R1, S_C secures C_C in R2. This is the highest achievable rank for Seeker_C.

1. Sincere Simulation: When Seeker_B bids sincerely ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C'], the stable matching outcome is M(B) = Company_B (Rank 3). Seeker_B loses Company_E (P1) to Seeker_E, who is ranked higher by Company_E (P3 vs P4). Seeker_B loses Company_A (P2) to Seeker_A, who is ranked higher by Company_A (P4 vs P5).

2. Strategic Analysis: Attempts to manipulate the ranking (e.g., applying to A or B first) failed because Seeker_B is universally low priority (P4 or P5) for the highly desired companies (E and A), and the outcome M is a stable matching based on true preferences. Since the outcome is stable, Seeker_B cannot unilaterally improve their match while maintaining stability.

3. Part 2 Analysis: The rule for 'blocking Job Seekers' only applies if a seeker's temporary admission caused a rejection, but that seeker later moved elsewhere. In the stable outcome derived from sincere preferences, this condition is not met for any seeker. Therefore, the Part 2 procedure does not alter the outcome M.

1. Company_D (1st choice) is unattainable because Seeker_D also prefers Company_D and Company_D ranks Seeker_D (2nd priority) higher than Seeker_C (4th priority).

I must verify if the addition of Part 2 (the blocking seeker check) changes this optimality for Seeker_D.

First, I simulate the outcome assuming all seekers, including Seeker_D, submit their true preferences. 

Round 1 results in D being matched with D, B with E, and A, C, E rejected from D.
Round 2 results in A matched with A, C matched with C, and E matched with E (rejecting B).

Seeker D is matched with Company D, which is Rank 1 on the true preference list. This is the best possible outcome.

Next, I analyze Part 2 (Blocking Check). A blocking seeker occurs only if a temporary admission caused a rejection, but the seeker eventually moved to a different company or remained unmatched. In M_T, every seeker who was temporarily admitted at a company where they caused a rejection (D at D, E at E) ended up finally matched with that same company.

The matching procedure is a variation of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm, where seekers propose (Part 1). In standard DA, truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for the proposing side, guaranteeing the seeker-optimal stable match.

1. Analysis of Part 1 (Truthful Reporting):
If all seekers report truthfully, the resulting stable match (M_T) is (S_A, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_D, C_D), (S_E, C_E). S_B matches with C_B, which is Rank 3 on my TPL.

2. Analysis of Strategic Misreporting:
To achieve a better rank (C_E or C_A), S_B must displace the current holders, S_E at C_E or S_A at C_A. Company C_E prefers S_E (3rd priority) over S_B (4th priority). Company C_A prefers S_A (4th priority) over S_B (5th priority). Since S_A and S_E are rejected from their first choice (C_D) and proceed to C_A and C_E respectively, they will always displace S_B if S_B holds those positions temporarily, or they will hold them before S_B gets a chance to apply later. Therefore, C_E and C_A are unattainable for S_B in Part 1.

3. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Job Seekers - BJS):
The BJS rule only applies if a seeker S temporarily holds a company C_X, causes a rejection, and then moves away to a preferred company C_Y. In the stable matching M_T, no seeker moves away from their final match. For instance, S_A moves from C_D (rejection) to C_A (final). S_A did not cause a rejection at C_A before matching there. S_E moves from C_D (rejection) to C_E (final). S_E rejects S_B at C_E, but S_E stays at C_E, so S_E is not a BJS.

Attempting strategic misreporting (e.g., applying to C_D first) only resulted in S_B getting C_D (Rank 4), which is worse than C_B (Rank 3).

Given that the market is fully subscribed (5 seekers, 5 companies, quota 1), the stable matching is unique. My goal is to achieve this unique seeker-optimal stable match.

Simulating the DA process assuming all other seekers submit their TPLs and I submit my TPL ('Company_D', 'Company_C', 'Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B'):

First, I simulate the outcome if all agents submit their True Preference Lists (P_S).

Simulation M_DA(P_S):
Round 1: S_B applies to C_E and is temporarily admitted (no rejections caused). S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E apply to C_D. C_D admits S_D, rejecting A, C, E.
Round 2: S_E applies to C_E (2nd choice). C_E prefers S_E (Rank 3) over S_B (Rank 4). S_E is admitted, S_B is rejected. S_A gets C_A, S_C gets C_C.

4. Conclusion: Since S_B cannot secure Rank 1 (C_E) or Rank 2 (C_A) due to higher priority seekers (S_E and S_A, respectively) being preferred by those companies in the stable matching, and because the mechanism is strategy-proof for the stable outcome, submitting the true preferences is the optimal strategy to secure the highest possible rank (C_B, Rank 3).",True,Company_B,True,True,3

1. Standard DA Analysis (Submitting TPL):
By submitting my TPL (E > A > B > D > C), I ensure I apply to my most preferred companies first, which is the optimal strategy for the proposing side in DA to achieve the best stable match.

Simulation Outcome:
Round 1: S_B applies to C_E (Admitted temporarily). No rejections caused.
Round 2: S_E applies to C_E. C_E prefers S_E over S_B. S_B is rejected by C_E. S_B applies to C_A. S_A applies to C_A. C_A prefers S_A over S_B. S_B is rejected by C_A.
Round 3: S_B applies to C_B (Admitted finally).
Final Match: Company_B (Rank 3).

2. Blocking Seeker Analysis (Part 2):
Seeker_B's temporary match at C_E in Round 1 differed from the final match (C_B). However, the definition of a blocking seeker requires that the temporary admission 'caused other Job Seekers to be rejected from that Company.' Since S_B was the sole applicant to C_E in Round 1, no rejections were caused by S_B's temporary admission at C_E. Therefore, S_B is not a blocking seeker, and the penalty (removal of C_E from the list) is not triggered.

First, I analyze the outcome if all seekers submit their true preferences (the stable matching):
1. In Round 1, Seekers A, C, D, and E all apply to C_D (my Rank 1 choice). Company D prioritizes S_B > S_D > S_E > S_C > S_A. Since S_D has higher priority (Rank 2) than S_C (Rank 4), C_D admits S_D, and I am rejected.
2. In subsequent rounds, following my true preferences (C_D rejected, applying to C_C), I eventually match with C_C (Rank 2).

Since S_D (who also prefers C_D first) has higher priority than me at C_D, I cannot secure C_D in any stable matching. Therefore, my best attainable stable match is C_C.

Since the DAA guarantees that submitting true preferences yields the best stable match available to me, and Part 2 does not seem to introduce instability that changes the final stable outcome in this scenario, submitting my true preferences is the optimal strategy to secure C_C (my Rank 2 choice).",True,Company_C,True,True,2

Analyzing Company D's priorities: Seeker_D (Priority 2) is ranked higher than Seeker_A (Priority 5), Seeker_C (Priority 4), and Seeker_E (Priority 3). Since Seeker_D prefers D first and is highly prioritized by D, Seeker_D will secure Company D in the first round and will not be rejected later, ensuring Seeker_D matches D. Therefore, Company D is unattainable for Seeker_A.

2. Stability and Part 2: If all seekers submit their true preferences, the resulting matching (S_A matched with A) is the stable matching. Since Seeker_D secures D and prefers D first, Seeker_D cannot become a 'blocking Job Seeker' at D (because their temporary admission equals their final admission).

In standard JS-DA, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for job seekers, guaranteeing the stable matching most favorable to seekers based on their submitted lists. 

1.  **Analyze Truthful Strategy (Submitting True Preference List):** If all agents submit their true preferences, the resulting stable matching (S) is {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. For Seeker_B, this results in a match with Company_B, which is Rank 3 on the True Preference List (['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C']).
2.  **Analyze Strategic Manipulation:** Seeker_B prefers Company_E (Rank 1) or Company_A (Rank 2). However, Seeker_B is ranked poorly by both E (4th) and A (5th). In the truthful run, both E and A match with candidates they prefer (E matches E, A matches A) who are also available (due to being rejected by higher priority choices like D). Since Seeker_B cannot displace these successful matches, strategic misrepresentation is unlikely to yield Rank 1 or 2.
3.  **Analyze Blocking Seekers (Part 2):** To successfully manipulate the outcome, Seeker_B would need to be temporarily admitted to a preferred company (e.g., E or A), cause rejections there, and then move to a better final position. Given Seeker_B's low priority at E and A, B is typically rejected immediately by better candidates (E rejects B in R2; A rejects B in R2). Furthermore, when B is temporarily admitted (e.g., B at E in R1 in the truthful run), B is often the only applicant, failing the 'Prevention' condition (causing rejections). Therefore, B is unlikely to become a blocking seeker, meaning the stable matching derived from Part 1 is usually final.

Any deviation risks receiving a worse outcome or the same outcome, but never a strictly better one (relative to the stable matching defined by the true preferences of all agents). 

I verified the outcome if all seekers submit their True Preference Lists (TPLs). Seeker C's TPL is ['Company_D', 'Company_C', 'Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B']. In the resulting stable match, Seeker C is matched with Company C (Rank 2). Company D (Rank 1) is unattainable because Seeker D is preferred by Company D and also applies to D first.

   An analysis of the DAA run using true preferences shows that no seeker qualifies as a 'blocking Job Seeker' (i.e., no seeker was temporarily admitted, caused rejections, and then ended up matched elsewhere).

My True Preference List is ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C'].

1. Target Company_E (Rank 1): Company_E prefers S_A, S_D, S_E over S_B. In the simulation using true preferences, S_B is temporarily admitted in R1 but is displaced by S_E in R2 (S_E is preferred by C_E and applies after failing to match with C_D). C_E is unattainable.
2. Target Company_A (Rank 2): Company_A prefers S_E, S_C, S_D, S_A over S_B. S_A is ranked #4 by C_A. S_A is rejected by C_D in R1 and applies to C_A in R2, securing the position. C_A is unattainable.
3. Target Company_B (Rank 3): Company_B prefers S_D (#1) and S_A (#2) over S_B (#3). Both S_D and S_A successfully match with their higher preferences (D and A, respectively) before applying to B. Therefore, B becomes available for S_B, who secures it in R3.

- Seeker B was temporarily admitted at E (R1), but caused no rejections (only applicant), so B is not blocking at E. B was admitted at B (R4) and M(B)=B. B is not blocking.

First, I analyze the outcome if all seekers submit their True Preference Lists (TPL):
1. R1: Seeker_E applies to Company_D (Rank 1). Company_D receives applications from S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E. D prefers S_D (Rank 2) over S_E (Rank 3). S_E is rejected.

3. The process stabilizes with Seeker_E matched to Company_E, which is Rank 2.

Since Seeker_E is rejected by Company_D (D prefers S_D), Seeker_E cannot achieve Rank 1 in the resulting stable matching (S*).

1. **Simulating Part 1 (JDA) with True Preferences:** When all agents submit their true preferences, Seeker_B (S_B) proposes to Company_E (C_E) in Round 1 and is temporarily accepted.

This outcome (S_B <-> C_B) is the seeker-optimal stable match. Since the matching is stable, no agents have an incentive to form a blocking pair.

I then verified if any agent became a 'blocking job seeker' during Part 1.

1. Analyze achievability of Rank 1 (Company D): Seeker_A has the lowest priority (Rank 5/5) at Company D.

Company D prioritizes Seeker D (Rank 2) over A (Rank 5), C (Rank 4), and E (Rank 3). Seeker D secures the spot at Company D immediately and permanently. Thus, Company D is unattainable for Seeker_A.

2. Determine the best stable outcome: Since Rank 1 is unattainable, the best possible outcome is Rank 2 (Company A). Submitting true preferences in a strategy-proof mechanism like DA usually yields the best stable match. When all seekers submit true preferences, Seeker_A matches with Company A (Rank 2).

3. Evaluate the effect of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers): When all true preferences are submitted, the resulting match is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (D > C > E > A > B):
If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_C (SC) ends up matched with Company_A (4th choice). This occurs because SC loses the initial competition for Company_D (to SD) and subsequently loses competition for Company_C (to Seeker_E, as Company_C highly prioritizes SE over SC).

2. Strategic Analysis:
Company_C ranks SC lowest (5th priority). Seeker_E (SE) ranks C as their 3rd choice (D > E > C...). If SC proposes C first, SC can secure C immediately (R1, as C is vacant). This prevents SE, who is prioritized over SC at C, from applying to C later. Since SE is rejected from D in R1, they apply to their 2nd choice, E, in R2. At Company_E, SE is preferred over the initial applicant (SB) and secures E. This cascade results in a stable matching where SC obtains Company_C (2nd choice).

3. Optimality Analysis: Seeker_C's Rank 1 choice is Company_D. However, Company_D receives applications from D, A, C, E in Round 1. Company_D prioritizes D (Rank 2) over C (Rank 4). Since D also ranks C_D first, D is matched with C_D and will never leave. Since Company_D prefers its current match D over Seeker_C, Seeker_C cannot achieve Rank 1 (C_D) in any stable matching.

Thus, no blocking seekers are found, and the stable matching (S_C -> C_C) is the final outcome.

3. Strategic Consideration: Since the stable outcome (C_C) is the best possible match for Seeker_C given the strong competition for C_D, and since submitting false preferences did not improve the outcome in test scenarios, the strategy-proof nature of the DA foundation dictates that submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy to guarantee the highest rank achievable.",True,Company_C,True,True,2

1. Initial DAA Run (using everyone's True Preferences):
Running the DAA with the given preferences results in the unique S-optimal stable matching, $M_{stable}$: A->A, B->B, C->C, D->D, E->E. For Seeker E, this means matching with Company E (2nd choice).

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2):
I verified the sequence of temporary admissions leading to $M_{stable}$. In this specific path, every seeker who was temporarily admitted at a company ended up matched to that company in $M_{stable}$ (e.g., D was admitted by D in R1 and D matched to D). Therefore, no job seeker meets the criteria for being a 'blocking Job Seeker' (Step 1: Prevention + Step 2: Discrepancy). The process terminates immediately after Part 1.

1. Standard DA Simulation (Part 1, Truthful Preferences):
   The simulation results in the stable matching M_S = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Seeker C matches with Company C, which is the 2nd choice.

   Seeker C is 4th priority at Company D (behind B, D, and E). Since Seekers D, A, and E all apply to D first, and D is the 2nd highest priority at D, D secures the spot immediately. Seeker C cannot displace D.

3. Blocking Job Seekers (Part 2):
   I checked if any seeker became a 'blocking job seeker' in the M_S outcome. A seeker is a blocker if they caused rejections at a company (H) but ultimately matched elsewhere. In M_S, the two instances where rejections occurred were D at D (rejecting A, C, E) and E at E (rejecting B). Both D and E remained permanently matched with D and E, respectively.

Furthermore, the Part 2 rule regarding blocking agents states that the waiver procedure 'will never change your final admission but may improve other Job Seekers' final admissions.' This strongly suggests that my final achieved match must be the stable match determined by my submitted list, regardless of whether I temporarily block others. Since submitting the true preference list yields the best possible stable match for me, it is the optimal strategy.

Finally, I confirmed that in the truthful scenario (Sim 1), Seeker_B was not a 'blocking Job Seeker' because B's temporary admission at Company E in R1 did not cause any other applicant to be rejected by E (E only received B's application).

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to aim for the seeker-optimal stable match based on my true preferences.

1. Check feasibility of Rank 1 (Company D): Company D prioritizes Seekers B, D, E, and C above Seeker A (A is Q5). Since Seekers D, C, and E all apply to D in R1 (D is P1 for all of them), Seeker D (Q2) will be admitted, and Seeker A (Q5) will be rejected immediately. Company D is unattainable.

2. Check feasibility of Rank 2 (Company A): If I submit my true list (D first), I am rejected by D in R1 and apply to A in R2. Company A accepts me (A prioritizes me Q4, and no higher priority seeker applies to A in R1). The resulting stable match is M(A) = A (Rank 2).

I confirmed that M1 is stable with respect to all true preferences (P and Q). Since M1 is stable, no 'blocking Job Seekers' (BJS) are found in Part 2, and the process terminates with M1 as the final match. Seeker_C matches with Company_C, which is Rank 2 on their list.

Simulation with TPL (Seeker_B: [E, A, B, D, C]):

3. Stability Check (Part 2): Since the resulting matching is stable (it is the stable matching optimal for the proposing side), no Job Seeker qualifies as a 'blocking Job Seeker,' and Part 2 does not alter the outcome. 

Therefore, submitting the true preference list maximizes Seeker C's outcome, leading to a match with Company C (2nd choice).",True,Company_C,True,True,2

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission (D > A > B > E > C):
If I submit truthfully, I apply to Company D (Rank 1). However, my priority at D is the lowest (5th). Company D accepts Seeker_D (2nd priority), and I am immediately rejected in Round 1.
In subsequent rounds, I fail to secure Company A (Rank 2) because Seeker_C, who has higher priority (2nd) than me (4th) at A, eventually replaces me there. I end up unmatched (Rank 6).

2. Strategic Analysis:
Since I have low priority at my top two choices (D and A), applying to them first results in rejection and leaves me vulnerable to higher-priority seekers (S_D at D, S_C at A) who eventually secure those spots. I must secure a stable match earlier.

3. Targeting Company B (True Rank 3):
My priority at Company B is 2nd (behind S_D). Seeker_D's true preference is D > B. Since S_D secures D in Round 1 (as D prefers S_D over all others applying), S_D will not apply to B. By applying to Company B first, I secure a match immediately in Round 1.

4. Conclusion:
Submitting B first guarantees a match at my Rank 3 choice (C_B), which is superior to the Rank 6 outcome achieved by being truthful. The remaining companies are listed in their true preference order (D > A > E > C) in case Company B rejects me (which is unlikely in this scenario).

1. Check Rank 1 (Company_D): Company_D prioritizes Seeker_D (Priority 2) above Seeker_E (Priority 3). Since Company_D is Seeker_D's top choice, Seeker_D will apply immediately and secure the spot over me. Company_D is unattainable.

2. Check Rank 2 (Company_E): Simulating the process assuming all agents submit their true preferences results in Seeker_E matching with Company_E. Company_E prefers Seeker_E (Priority 3) over Seeker_B (Priority 4), who is the primary competitor for that spot in early rounds. 

3. Impact of Part 2: The complex rules regarding 'blocking Job Seekers' in Part 2 typically aim to ensure the final outcome is stable, especially if agents misrepresent preferences. Since submitting true preferences guarantees the Seeker-optimal stable match in DAA, and this simulation results in a stable assignment where I achieve my second-best choice (C_E), there is no incentive or opportunity to misrepresent preferences to achieve a better outcome. Misrepresenting could potentially lead to a worse match (e.g., C_C or lower).

Simulation (True Preferences):
In Round 1, Seeker_A applies to Company_D. Company_D receives applications from A, C, D, and E. Since Seeker_D has higher priority (2nd) than Seeker_A (5th) at Company_D, Seeker_D is admitted, and Seeker_A is rejected.

Checking for Part 2 Intervention:
In M1, the only temporary admission causing rejections was Seeker_D at Company_D in R1. Since Seeker_D's final match is Company_D, there is no discrepancy, and thus no blocking seeker is found. M1 is the final stable match.

1. Initial Simulation (using True Preferences $P_B = (E, A, B, D, C)$):
    - Round 1: B proposes to E and is temporarily admitted. Seeker E, A, C, D propose to D; D admits D. A, C, E are rejected.

2. Stability and Constraints Check: Companies A and E rank Seeker B very low (5th and 4th, respectively).

I must therefore focus on maximizing my outcome in Part 1 by submitting my True Preference List: ['Company_D', 'Company_E', 'Company_C', 'Company_B', 'Company_A'].

Simulation of DAA with truthful preferences:
1. Seeker_E proposes to Company_D (P1).
2. Company_D receives proposals from A, C, D, E. Company_D prefers D (Q2) over E (Q3). Seeker_E is rejected.
3. Seeker_E proposes to Company_E (P2).
4. Company_E admits E (Q3), rejecting Seeker B (Q4). E secures Company_E (Rank 2). This is the highest rank achievable given that Seeker D secures Company D.",True,Company_E,True,True,2

Therefore, manipulation is unlikely to yield a better result, and submitting true preferences remains the optimal strategy to achieve the highest ranked company in the stable matching set. 

Analyzing the stable matching outcome using true preferences: Seeker_A's top choice, Company_D, ranks Seeker_A lowest (5th) among all applicants (S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E) in Round 1, leading to immediate rejection.

1. Analysis of the Stable Matching (S) using all True Preferences:
   - My top choice, Company D, receives proposals from Seekers A, C, D, and E in Round 1. Company D prefers Seeker D (Q2) over Seeker C (Q4) and accepts Seeker D. I am rejected immediately.
   - Following subsequent applications (Round 2), I apply to my second choice, Company C, and am accepted (Company C ranks me Q5, but no higher priority seeker applies to C early enough to displace me).
   - The resulting stable matching S is: (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E). My outcome is Company C (Preference Rank 2).

2. Feasibility of achieving Company D (P1):
   - I cannot achieve Company D because Seeker D, who is preferred by Company D (Q2 vs. my Q4) and also prefers D (P1), secures the spot. I cannot force Seeker D to apply elsewhere or move away from D, as D only moves if rejected by D, which is unlikely given the priorities.

3. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers):
   - I traced the Temporary Admissions (TAs) during the DA run leading to S. Since all seekers who were TA at a company ended up matched with that same company in the final outcome S, no blocking seekers are found. Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger a rerun, and S is the final outcome.

If all seekers report truthfully, Seeker_B (S_B) applies to Company_E (C_E) in Round 1 and is temporarily admitted. In Round 2, Seeker_E (S_E) applies to C_E after being rejected by Company_D (C_D).

Seeker_A's Rank 1 choice is Company_D. In the truthful DA simulation (S1), Company_D receives applications from A, C, D, and E in Round 1. Company_D's priority list is [B, D, E, C, A]. Seeker_D (Priority 2 at D) is admitted, and Seeker_A (Priority 5 at D) is rejected. Since Seeker_D ranks Company_D first and has higher priority than A, A cannot displace D from Company_D. Thus, Rank 1 is unreachable.

Seeker_A's Rank 2 choice is Company_A. In S1, after being rejected by D, A proposes to A in Round 2. Company_A is available and admits A. The final outcome for Seeker_A is a match with Company_A (Rank 2).

1. Analysis of Sincere Submission (CRL = TPL): Submitting [E, A, B, D, C] results in a highly unstable matching process due to the Part 2 'blocking seeker' rule. Tracing the iterations (Rerun 1, Rerun 2, Rerun 3) shows that the final outcome for Seeker_B is being unmatched (Rank 6), as other seekers' forced waivers destabilize the market in a way detrimental to Seeker_B (who is low priority at high-ranked companies).

2. Analysis of Strategic Manipulation: Since the sincere strategy leads to the worst possible outcome, a manipulation is necessary to achieve a stable matching that maximizes B's rank.

3. Targeting R1 (E) or R2 (A): Seeker_B is low priority at Company E (Rank 4) and Company A (Rank 5). Any attempt to apply to E first results in B being quickly rejected by higher-priority seekers (E or A) and starting a rejection chain.

First, I analyze the maximum possible outcome for Seeker_C (C_D, Rank 1). C_D prefers Seeker_D (Rank 2) and Seeker_B (Rank 1) over Seeker_C (Rank 4). Since Seeker_D also ranks C_D first and C_D prefers S_D, S_C cannot secure C_D even if S_C manipulates their list, as S_D will always displace S_C.

Second, I confirm the stable match outcome assuming truthful reporting (submitting TPL: D > C > E > A > B). This outcome is (S_C, C_C), which is Rank 2. Since Rank 1 (C_D) is unattainable, Rank 2 (C_C) is the optimal outcome.

Third, I consider Part 2 (Blocking Job Seekers).

1. Analyze feasibility of Rank 1 (Company_D): Company_D ranks Seeker_A last (Priority 5). Since Seekers D, E, and C all rank D first and have higher priority than A (D=Prio 2, E=Prio 3, C=Prio 4), Seeker_A cannot secure Company_D, even if applying truthfully.

2. Analyze the outcome of truthful submission (D, A, B, E, C) using the Part 1 DA procedure. The resulting matching is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Seeker_A matches with Company_A (Rank 2 on TPL).

3. Verify stability and Part 2 relevance: I verified that the matching M is stable (no blocking pairs exist). Since the matching is stable, no Job Seeker meets the specific criteria for being a 'blocking Job Seeker' based on temporary vs. final admissions. Therefore, Part 2 is not triggered, and M is the final outcome.

4. Strategic deviation analysis: Since truthful submission guarantees the Seeker-Optimal Stable Matching (which provides Rank 2, the highest attainable rank), any deviation risks receiving a match lower than Rank 2. For instance, prioritizing Company_A first yields the same final match (A), while prioritizing Company_B first yields a worse match (A, Rank 3 on TPL).
