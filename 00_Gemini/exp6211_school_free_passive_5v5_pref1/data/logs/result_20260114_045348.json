Seeker_C is my 3rd priority (P3). Seeker_C's preference list places me as their 1st priority (P1) and they have applied directly. While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher on my list, Seeker_C is applying in Round 1, offering a mutual P1/P3 stable match immediately. This is a very strong outcome early on, and holding out for P1 or P2 risks losing them to competitors (Company_A or Company_B) or failing to match entirely.
