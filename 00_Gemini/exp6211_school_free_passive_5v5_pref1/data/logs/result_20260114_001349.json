Since it is Round 1 and the market is fully open, the optimal strategy is to reject the lowest priority candidate to keep the quota open for potential matches with higher-ranked seekers in subsequent rounds.

We conduct formal reviews at 90 days and 180 days, supplemented by bi-weekly 1-on-1 feedback sessions with your manager to ensure continuous alignment and support.\n\nRegarding professional development, we allocate an annual stipend of $3,000 for external courses, conferences, or certifications, accessible immediately upon hiring. Furthermore, we run an internal mentorship program pairing new hires with senior leadership across departments, and dedicate Fridays to 'Innovation Time' for skill development or experimental projects.
