I have already applied once in the history. Company_E ranks me last (5th). However, given the late stage (Round 15), it is highly probable that the four seekers ranked above me (A, B, C, D) have already secured matches elsewhere, making me the most preferred *available* candidate for Company_E. Since this is my top choice and the market is concluding, I must reapply aggressively ([APPLY]) to secure the match, emphasizing my unwavering dedication and readiness to accept immediately."

Seeker_E is my lowest priority candidate (Rank #5) but is still on the list. The current list of unmatched Job Seekers only contains Seeker_E. If I reject Seeker_E now, I will fail to fill my quota entirely. Seeker_E is highly motivated, confirming Company_E is their unequivocal top preference and they are ready to accept immediately, ensuring a stable match. Given that no higher-ranked candidates are available, accepting Seeker_E is necessary to fulfill the company's objective of matching within the quota."
