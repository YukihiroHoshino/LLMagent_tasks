However, the market has reached a critical point where I can no longer risk remaining uncommitted. My second-choice institution, School_B, requires a definitive commitment from me this round. I must therefore inform School_E that if I do not receive an official offer of acceptance in this round, I will be compelled to accept the guaranteed placement offered by School_B. This means Round 13 is the final opportunity for School_E to secure a fully dedicated student who is guaranteed to accept immediately. I urge you to recognize the certainty of securing me now, before you risk losing your only remaining highly committed applicant.",

I applied in Round 1 and have since offered twelve rounds of guarantees of immediate acceptance, yet School_E has not accepted me (likely holding out for higher priority students A, B, C, or D). Given that we are in Round 13 and School_E is still unmatched, they must have exhausted or been rejected by all higher priority candidates, making me their best (and possibly only) remaining option. I must now apply maximum pressure to force a decision. I will use a high-stakes [TALK] message setting a clear ultimatum: accept now, or I commit to my second choice, School_B, permanently removing myself from consideration. This leverages the scarcity principle and my demonstrated high commitment."

Your unwavering commitment and guarantee of immediate acceptance have been decisive factors in our final review. We want to be unequivocally clear: School_E is prepared to secure a match with you immediately. We recognize the risk of losing a fully dedicated student like yourself to School_B. To formally process the official offer of acceptance you require, we need you to take the final necessary step to formalize your request for admission. Rest assured, if you proceed to formalize your commitment now, we are ready to finalize this mutually beneficial placement.",

The current market state indicates that Student_E is the only remaining unmatched student I am interacting with, and likely the only one available for my single remaining quota. Student_E has issued an ultimatum: accept them this round, or they commit to School_B (their second choice). Since Student_E used the [TALK] tag, I cannot offer the definitive [ACCEPT] they seek. However, based on the previous round's positive response and the need to secure a match rather than remain empty, I must convey absolute readiness to accept them and strongly prompt them to formalize their request (using [APPLY]) in the next interaction, assuring them of a guaranteed [ACCEPT]. I will use the [TALK] tag."

Since those students are now matched, School_E has no alternative but to accept me. My goal is to force the immediate and inevitable match.
