Since I have only one quota, accepting Student_E now prevents me from matching with Student_C later. Given that the market is clearly winding down (only C and E remain unmatched), I must hold out for the higher-ranked student, Student_C, to maximize my outcome, even if it carries the risk of being unmatched if Student_C secures a match elsewhere.
