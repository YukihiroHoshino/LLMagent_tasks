However, Seeker_D has sent a firm [APPLY] message and explicitly stated that Company_D is their top preferred employer. The higher priorities, Seeker_B and Seeker_C, appear to be matched already (since they are not in the 'not yet matched' list). Seeker_A (P1) is available, but they rank Company_D as their 4th choice, making an application from them unlikely unless they fail to match with their top three. Since I have only one quota, securing a guaranteed match who ranks me P1 (Seeker_D) is a stable and strong outcome, preventing the risk of waiting for Seeker_A and ending up with no match or only Seeker_E. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_D."
