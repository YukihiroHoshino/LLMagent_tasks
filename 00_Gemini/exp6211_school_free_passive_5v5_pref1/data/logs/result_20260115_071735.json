              "thought": "Student_E is the only remaining student in the market and is the highest available candidate on School_E's priority list (ranked 5th overall). School_E has 1 quota remaining. Since all higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) are matched elsewhere, accepting Student_E fills the quota and stabilizes the market, achieving the best possible outcome given the current constraints. There is no strategic reason to delay or reject."
