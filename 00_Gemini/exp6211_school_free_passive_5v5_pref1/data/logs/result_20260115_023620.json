I previously issued an ultimatum that failure to use [APPLY] in Round 26 would terminate negotiations. Student_B failed to comply, using [TALK] again. Strictly following the ultimatum would force me to move to Student_E (P5), a significantly lower priority. Given the extreme urgency and the high value of P2, compromising the ultimatum to secure the best possible match is strategically necessary. I must reiterate the guaranteed acceptance but set an absolute, non-negotiable final deadline for Round 27, emphasizing that failure to comply will lead to immediate termination and pursuit of P5."
