Based on our comprehensive understanding of your qualifications and the strong alignment you've demonstrated with our strategic goals, we are delighted to confirm our mutual interest.

              "thought": "Company_D's goal is to match with the highest possible ranked Job Seeker within its quota of 1. Seeker_D is ranked 4th on Company_D's priority list (['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E']). Seeker_D has formally applied and indicated Company_D is their top choice. Although Seeker_C (Rank 3) is higher priority and still available, Seeker_D's immediate application, coupled with the strong mutual preference (Seeker_D ranks Company_D #1), provides a highly stable match that secures the quota immediately. Accepting Seeker_D is a sound decision to guarantee a match, rather than risking being left unmatched by waiting for Seeker_C."

However, the market status shows that all my higher preferences (Company_C, B, A, D) are already matched, as Company_E is the only company listed as 'not yet matched'. Given that Company_E is still on my preference list, and securing a match is paramount when all better options are exhausted, I must now formally apply. I have already engaged in extensive 'TALK' rounds (3 rounds) to gather necessary information."

The market summary indicates that Seeker_C is the only remaining unmatched Job Seeker. Given that Seeker_C has engaged in extensive positive discussions and has now formally applied, and since I need to fill my quota and cannot afford to wait for higher-ranked candidates (A and B) who are presumed matched, matching with Seeker_C is the optimal strategic decision. I will accept the application immediately."
