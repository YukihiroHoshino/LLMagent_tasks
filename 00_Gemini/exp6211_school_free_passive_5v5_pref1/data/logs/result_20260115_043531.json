Since School_A has much higher priority applicants (A, B, C, D) who also rank them highly, applying formally now ([APPLY]) is likely to result in an immediate [REJECT], as they will hold out for better candidates. Given that I have two schools ranked higher (E and B) that I have not yet interacted with, it is strategically better to use [TALK] to express strong interest in School_A (as it is P3) and keep the door open, without committing to an application that is likely to fail, thus conserving my options for P1 or P2 in subsequent rounds."
