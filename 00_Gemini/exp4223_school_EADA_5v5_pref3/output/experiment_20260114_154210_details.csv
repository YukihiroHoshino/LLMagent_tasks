2. Blocking analysis of M1: Only Student D was identified as blocking at School C (D was temporarily admitted to C, caused E's rejection, but D later moved to E). Student C was not blocking.
3. Part 2, Step 1 Waiver: Only D's list was modified. C submitted the true list: ['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_E'].
4. Rerunning Part 1 (M4): This modification led to a beneficial outcome for C, M4(C) = School D (1st choice).
5. Subsequent iterations of Part 2 (M5): Further waivers occurred for Students D and A, but the final matching M5 remained M4, and no further blocking students were identified.

1. Initial DA (Truthful Submission P_B = ['School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_C']): Student_B matches with School_B (1st choice).
2. Part 2 Adjustment: Student_D is identified as a blocking student (D was temporarily admitted by C, then moved to E). School_C is removed from D's list (P'_D).
3. Rerun Part 1 with P'_D: If Student_B maintains P_B, the simulation shows that Student_B is rejected by School_B (due to Student_A having higher priority and proposing later) and ultimately ends up Unmatched (U), which is the worst possible outcome.

Since submitting truthfully leads to the worst outcome after the Part 2 adjustment, misreporting is necessary.

I tested several misreports to find one that secures a high preference match after the Rerun 1 phase:

Student B's True Preference List is ['School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_C'].

If Student B submits the sincere list, the resulting match is School_A (Rank 3). This occurs because Student A (who has higher priority than B at School_B) eventually applies to and secures School_B, displacing B.

To achieve the Rank 1 choice (School_B), Student B must delay applying to School_B until critical competitors (like Student A) are successfully matched to their own high-preference schools, preventing them from applying to School_B.

2. Outcome Analysis (Truthful Submission): If Student_A submits their true preference list ['School_A', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_B', 'School_E'], the outcome of Part 1 (SPDA) results in the final match (A, A). School_A is Student_A's rank 1 preference.

3. Blocking Check (Part 2): Since Student_A matched with their first choice (School_A), and this match was secured in Round 1 and held throughout, Student_A cannot be a 'blocking student' at School_A (their final match is their temporary match). Furthermore, the resulting stable matching (A-A, B-B, C-E, D-C, E-D) does not contain any blocking students according to the defined criteria, meaning Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

   - Student E's top three choices (C, B, A) are matched with students (D, B, A, respectively) who are strictly preferred by those schools over Student E.

2. Blocking Student Check (Part 2, Step 1): Several students are identified as blocking students (e.g., A at A and B, D at C and A). The latest blocking event involves Student A, who moved from School B (Rank 4) to School E (Rank 5). School B is removed from Student A's list.
3. Rerun 1: With A's modified list, the new stable match M' results in (B, B). My match is School B (Rank 1).
4. Rerun 2: Another blocking student (A) is found, leading to another waiver. The final stable match M'' remains (B, B). My match remains School B (Rank 1).

Since submitting my true preference list leads to the highest possible outcome (Rank 1) after the market mechanism completes its stabilizing process, and any deviation that results in a worse initial stable match (Part 1) is clearly suboptimal, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.",True,School_A,False,False,3

3. Impact of Part 2: The complex Part 2 mechanism modifies preference lists based on temporary admissions that cause rejections. When $L_D$ is submitted, Part 2 triggers waivers for other students (S_A), and eventually for S_D itself (waiver of H_C after Rerun 1, because S_D temporarily blocked S_E at H_C in R1 of Rerun 1, but S_D ended up at H_A in M2).

4. Final Outcome: When submitting the True Preference List, the system converges to a final stable matching (M3) where Student_D is matched with School_A (Rank 2). This outcome is achieved because the Part 2 waivers prevent S_B from displacing S_D from H_A, which happened in the initial M1 run.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Reporting):
If Student_A reports their true preference list ['School_A', 'School_C', 'School_D', 'School_B', 'School_E'], the standard DA outcome (M1) results in Student_A being matched to School_E (P5). This occurs because Student_A has low priority (Q3 or worse) at all their higher ranked schools (A, C, D, B) and is consistently rejected by students with higher priority (B, D, C, E).

2. Part 2 Impact (Truthful Reporting):
The analysis of blocking students in M1 leads to waivers for Student_A (waiving B) and Student_D (waiving A, C). When DA is rerun (M2), the final outcome remains A -> E (P5).

3. Strategic Deviation Assessment:
Since Student_A is a weak candidate for their top choices, any attempt to strategically apply to a lower ranked school (like B or E) where they have a higher priority (Q2 or Q1, respectively) risks misaligning the market and failing to secure a match at all after the Part 2 waivers are applied (as demonstrated in the internal simulation, where applying to B or E first resulted in A being unmatched).

1. Initial DA Run (M) using True Preferences: Student B submits ['School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_C']. The stable match M results in Student B matching with School D (Rank 2), as Student A, who is preferred by School B, eventually claims School B.

3. Rerun 1: The system removes School D from Student E's list and reruns DA. Because Student E's preferences are truncated, the resulting stable match (M') changes the assignments of other students, including Student A and Student B.

Student C's true preference is School D (Rank 1). School D highly prefers Student D and Student E over Student C (C is 3rd priority). In the truthful scenario, C applies to D first, gets rejected by D when E applies (R4), and is pushed down to School E (Rank 5) after the Part 2 iterations.

The strategy is to delay the application to School D until other high-priority students (like A and B) have applied and been rejected elsewhere, and crucially, until the iterative Part 2 procedure modifies other students' lists in a way that benefits C.

By ranking School A (Rank 2) first, C is rejected by A in R1 (since A prefers Student A). C then applies to School D (Rank 1) in R2.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_D = [C, A, B, E, D]):
    * School_C (Rank 1) is highly desired, but Student_C has the highest priority (1st) at School_C, while Student_D is 3rd. Student_C eventually secures School_C in the initial DA simulation, displacing Student_D. Thus, School_C is unattainable.
    * School_A (Rank 2) is the next best option. Student_D is 2nd priority at School_A, below Student_B (1st) but above Student_A (3rd).

2. Simulation with True Preferences:
    * Part 1 (DA) results in M_DA(S_D) = School_B (Rank 3).
    * The subsequent Part 2 iterations (which are designed to resolve temporary blocking behavior without changing the final admission derived from the truthful submission, according to the rules) modify lists of other students (and eventually S_D's list by removing School_C) until the final stable outcome M_final(S_D) = School_A (Rank 2) is reached.

Even with the addition of Part 2 (the 'blocking student' check and subsequent reruns of DA), Student A has already achieved their Rank 1 choice. Since no outcome can be better than Rank 1, manipulation is unnecessary and potentially detrimental if it leads to a non-stable match that Part 2 resolves to a worse stable match for Student A.

The standard Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) outcome (M1), achieved by submitting true preferences ['School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_C'], leads to a match with School_B. However, the unique rules of this market (Part 2: Blocking Students Check) necessitate reruns of the DA process, ultimately resulting in a final matching (M3) where I match with School_D (Rank 2).

The key instability in M1 arises because Student_D and Student_E become blocking students, forcing them to update their lists. This iterative process eventually allows Student_A (ranked higher than me at School_B) and Student_D (also highly ranked at School_B) to displace me from School_B in subsequent reruns.

To ensure I secure School_B (Rank 1) and that the resulting matching stabilizes immediately (avoiding further reruns that displace me), I must strategically alter the application flow in Round 1 of the initial DA process.

Specifically, I need to prevent Student_A from being rejected by School_A and subsequently pursuing School_B. School_A prefers Student_B (me, Rank 1) over Student_D (Rank 2) and Student_A (Rank 3). If I apply to School_A early, I take the seat, forcing S_D to pursue B, displacing me. If I submit my true preferences, S_A gets A initially, but S_D later forces S_A out in the Rerun 1.

By strategically demoting School_A (where I am the highest priority) to the last position, I allow Student_D (who is the second highest priority at School_A, and who gets C removed from their list in the rerun) to secure School_A over Student_A in Round 1. This prevents S_D from proposing to School_B later (where S_D > S_B), and allows S_A to match with School_C (S_A's #2 choice). Simultaneously, I propose to School_B first, securing it immediately over Student_E (S_B > S_E at School_B).
