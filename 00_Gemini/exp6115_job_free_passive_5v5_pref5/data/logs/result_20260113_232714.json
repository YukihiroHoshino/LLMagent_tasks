If the other four companies (B, C, A, E) are matched, and I am still available, securing a match with D is paramount, as D is still preferred over unemployment. I have already spent three rounds gathering information ([TALK]), indicating I was keeping D as a strong backup. Company_D ranks me highly (Rank 2).
