              "thought": "It is Round 30, the absolute final round, and Seeker_E is the only remaining candidate. Seeker_E is ranked 4th on my priority list, making them an acceptable match to fill the remaining quota of 1. Seeker_E has consistently guaranteed immediate, unconditional acceptance using the [TALK] tag, but has failed to use the necessary [APPLY] tag to trigger my [ACCEPT]. Since Seeker_E used [TALK] again, I must reply with [TALK].
