We acknowledge that we previously emphasized a requirement for highly specialized technical expertise. However, after carefully re-evaluating the immediate needs of Project Nova and considering the immense dedication you have demonstrated, we recognize that your drive and readiness to commit immediately are qualities essential for success in an agile environment. We are prepared to invest in your rapid integration and development. We are pleased to reverse our previous decision and formally offer you the position. We look forward to welcoming you to the team.",

I must compromise given the apparent depletion of the market."
