Company_B is my P1, but they rank me P5, making a match less likely.\nSince I am paired with Company_D (P5) this round, applying and securing this low-ranked match would prevent me from pursuing better options (B or E) in subsequent rounds.\nI have already used [TALK] once with Company_D.

Seeker_E is currently applying and ranks Company_D as their 2nd preference, indicating a high-quality, stable match. While Seeker_A is technically higher on my list, they rank Company_D 5th, making them very difficult to secure, especially since they are also highly sought after by other companies. Furthermore, Seeker_E is Company_A's top priority, meaning if I delay, I will certainly lose Seeker_E. Given the certainty of the application, the high preference Seeker_E shows for us, and the high risk associated with holding out for Seeker_A (who ranks us last), securing Seeker_E is the optimal strategy to fill my single quota with the highest possible stable match."
