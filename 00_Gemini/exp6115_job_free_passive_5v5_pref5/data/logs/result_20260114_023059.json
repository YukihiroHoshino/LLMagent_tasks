Crucially, Company_A ranks me (Seeker_D) as their #2 priority, right behind Seeker_E. This is a very strong signal for acceptance. I have already engaged in preliminary talks with Company_A. Given the high mutual interest and the favorable ranking, I must apply immediately to secure this position before Seeker_E makes a move or other agents complicate the negotiation. If successful, I secure my highest remaining preference."

I have already rejected lower-ranked candidates (Seeker_A, P3; Seeker_B, P4) to hold out for a high-priority match. Seeker_D is now formally applying after a successful previous 'TALK' exchange, confirming their strong interest (P3 preference for Company_A). Securing a P2 candidate is an excellent outcome and maximizes my utility, especially since waiting for P1 (Seeker_E) carries a high risk of losing both Seeker_D and potentially failing to secure Seeker_E, who prefers Company_B and Company_C. I must accept this strong P2 application immediately."

Although Company_E is my 4th choice, critically, I am Company_E's absolute top priority (Rank 1 on their list). Since a match with Company_E is guaranteed and secures a position high on my list (Rank 4, better than Rank 5 or unemployment), I should secure this match immediately rather than risking another rejection from Company_A (where I am Rank 3 for them).
