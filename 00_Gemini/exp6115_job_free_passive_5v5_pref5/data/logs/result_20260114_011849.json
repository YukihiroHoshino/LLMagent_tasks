To answer your question directly: we are currently in an active phase of review, and formal applications are always accepted and considered immediately upon receipt. However, regarding the final selection process, we are committed to a comprehensive evaluation of all strong candidates, and we anticipate finalizing our decision within the next few rounds. We appreciate your patience as we ensure the best possible fit for this critical role.",

Seeker_B is signaling readiness to apply, but since I have higher-ranked candidates still in play, I must avoid committing to Seeker_B prematurely. I need to keep Seeker_B engaged as a backup option while continuing to pursue Seeker_A and Seeker_E. I will reply with [TALK], confirming that we are actively reviewing candidates and managing the expectation regarding the final selection timeline, without explicitly closing the application window."

Company_E is the target for this round.\nCrucially, Company_E ranks Seeker_A as their #1 priority. This is an extremely favorable situation. To secure the highest possible match, I must apply immediately to Company_E. This guarantees a match at Rank 4, which is currently the best achievable outcome given the market dynamics."

I have already used a previous [TALK] message to signal extremely high interest and commitment, stating they are my 'top-tier choice.' Given the high preference rank and the fact that we are now in Round 7 with no matches, it is strategically necessary to move from signaling to formal commitment to secure this match, especially since my priority rank at Company_D is low (4th). I must force a decision now before my preferred companies are taken by others. I will formally [APPLY] and reaffirm my commitment and specific qualifications."

Welcome to the team!",
              "thought": "Company_D's priority list is ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']. Seeker_E is the 4th priority overall. Assuming Seeker_D and Seeker_C are matched elsewhere (as they are not listed as unmatched), Seeker_E is the second-highest available priority (P4 overall, P2 available after Seeker_A). Seeker_E ranks Company_D as their P2 choice and is applying with immediate commitment. While Seeker_A (my P2) is still available, they rank Company_D as their P5, making a successful match unlikely soon. Securing a high-ranking, highly motivated candidate (Seeker_E) who aligns well with the role and is applying directly is a strong strategic move to fulfill the quota efficiently, rather than risking being unmatched or settling for Seeker_B (P5) while waiting for the highly improbable Seeker_A match."
