Seeker_C has been actively engaged and just submitted a formal [APPLY], which I previously encouraged. Securing a strong, engaged, Rank 3 candidate now is a very good outcome, guaranteeing a fill for the quota, rather than risking losing Seeker_C to competitors (B or C, which Seeker_C prefers) while waiting indefinitely for the highly reluctant Seeker_D. I will accept Seeker_C."

              "thought": "Company_B is Seeker_D's #1 preference. Seeker_D has previously applied (R1) and followed up with a strong 'TALK' (R3). Since Company_B is still unmatched in Round 4, they are likely holding out for their higher priorities (Seeker_E, Seeker_B, Seeker_C). However, the market is progressing, and persistence is key for a top choice. Since I have applied before, using [APPLY] again is the strongest way to signal renewed, urgent commitment and force Company_B to process the application now, potentially securing the spot before higher-ranked seekers finalize their decisions elsewhere. I must emphasize the fit and the urgency of securing the match."

We appreciate your patience during our internal organizational review. As we communicated previously, the delay was purely a matter of timing. We are now in a position to finalize our hiring decisions. Given your profile and dedication, we are delighted to formally extend an offer based on your application. We look forward to welcoming you to the team.",
              "thought": "I am Company_B. My priority list is ['Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A']. My remaining quota is 1. Seeker_D is my 4th priority. Seeker_C (3rd priority) is the only candidate ranked higher than Seeker_D who is still unmatched. Seeker_D is highly committed, listing Company_B as their top choice and applying immediately after previous rejections/talks. Given that I have only one quota left and the two highest priorities (E and B) are gone, securing a match now with Seeker_D (rank 4) is a safer strategy than rejecting them for the third time and risking losing both D and C to other companies. Seeker_D's dedication and fit with our mission are well-established through the history. I will accept this application."
