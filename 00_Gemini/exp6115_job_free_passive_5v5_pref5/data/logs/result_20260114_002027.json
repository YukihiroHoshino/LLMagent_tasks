Seeker_E is highly committed (Rank 1 preference for C) and offers guaranteed acceptance. Given that we are in Round 13, and Seeker_E correctly assumes that my higher priorities (B, C, D) are likely matched or engaged elsewhere, waiting further is too risky, as I might lose Seeker_E without securing anyone. I have been attempting to push Seeker_E to use the [APPLY] tag for several rounds (R11, R12) to formalize the match, and I need to continue this pressure, making it clear that I am ready to accept immediately upon receiving the correct tag. Since Seeker_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."
