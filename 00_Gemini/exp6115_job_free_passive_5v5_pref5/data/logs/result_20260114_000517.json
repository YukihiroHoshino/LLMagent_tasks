Seeker_D has applied repeatedly, confirming Company_B is their definitive first choice. While Seeker_D is a guaranteed stable match for them, they are low on my list. I still have higher priority candidates (E, B, C) who are likely available, especially C (who ranks me 1st) and B (who ranks me 2nd). Since it is only Round 5 and I have not yet secured my top choices, accepting my 4th choice now is premature.

Both Seeker_B (Rank 2) and Seeker_C (Rank 3, and Company_B is their top choice) are still available. Seeker_D has demonstrated absolute commitment through multiple rounds, confirming Company_B as their definitive first choice. Given this strong commitment and the availability of higher-priority candidates, it is strategically sound to continue rejecting Seeker_D to keep the position open for Seeker_B or Seeker_C, while minimizing the risk of Seeker_D withdrawing."

While Seeker_D is not my highest priority, they have demonstrated exceptional, unwavering commitment over seven consecutive rounds, consistently confirming Company B as their definitive first choice (Rank 1 preference). We are in Round 7, and I have not secured a match yet. My highest priority candidate, Seeker_E, ranks me last (Rank 5), making a match highly improbable. My next targets (Seeker_B and Seeker_C) are still possibilities, but continuing to reject a highly committed candidate like Seeker_D risks them matching with another company (like Company_C, who ranks them 3rd), leaving me with potentially only Seeker_A (my lowest priority). Given the sustained commitment and the need to secure a match before the market closes, compromising on my 4th choice, who ranks me 1st, is a stable and pragmatic decision at this stage."
