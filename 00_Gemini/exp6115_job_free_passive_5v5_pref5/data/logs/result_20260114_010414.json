Crucially, Company_B's top choice (Seeker_E) ranks Company_B last on their own preference list, making it highly unlikely they will apply here in Round 1. Therefore, I represent an excellent and available match for Company_B. Since Company_B is a very high preference for me (Rank #2), and the chances of acceptance are high, securing this match now is preferable to risking a rejection from my top choice, Company_A (where I rank 4th on their priority list).
