I previously engaged in a [TALK] interaction with them, indicating interest but withholding a formal application. Given my very low ranking on their priority list, applying now is highly likely to result in a rejection, which is detrimental to my overall strategy. Furthermore, I still have two higher preferences available (Company_A, where I applied previously, and Company_B, where I rank 2nd in their priorities). I must preserve my application bandwidth and focus on higher-ranking companies first. I will use [TALK] again to maintain warm interest with Company_D and gather information about their hiring timeline, without committing to an application that is likely to fail."

My strategy is to keep the conversation going to maintain an option, but not encourage an immediate application, as I prefer to save my quota for Seeker_A or Seeker_C. I will answer their question directly and professionally using the [TALK] tag."
