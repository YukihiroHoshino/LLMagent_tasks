While my top two choices (D and A) are available, they both rank Company_D last in their preferences, making a successful match with them highly improbable in early rounds. Seeker_C ranks Company_D 3rd and has actively applied in Round 1. Securing a moderately high-priority candidate immediately, rather than risking losing them and potentially ending up unmatched or with a lower priority candidate (E or B) later, is the optimal strategy.

While Seeker_B and Seeker_C are preferred, Seeker_D is a strong candidate and has applied directly in Round 1. Furthermore, Seeker_D ranks Company_C highly (2nd preference). Given that Seeker_D is also highly desired by other companies (e.g., Company_D ranks them 1st), rejecting this application carries a high risk of losing them entirely, potentially forcing me to settle for Seeker_E or Seeker_A later, or risk failing to match.
