Company_D ranks me 3rd on their priority list ('Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C'). Since I am ranked reasonably high by them, and they are a solid choice for me, I should capitalize on this opportunity in Round 1 before the market changes.

The target, Seeker_C, is my P3 candidate and has applied in Round 1. My P1 (Seeker_D) and P2 (Seeker_A) both rank Company_D last (5th), making it highly unlikely they will apply to me unless the simulation progresses significantly and they are rejected elsewhere. Seeker_C, however, ranks me 3rd and has applied immediately. Furthermore, Seeker_C is highly desired by Company_C (P2 priority). Accepting Seeker_C (P3) now is a robust strategy to secure a high-value match early, given the low probability of successfully attracting P1 or P2."

While Seeker_E is not my top choice, they have applied and indicated that Company_C is their Rank 1 preference.
