Seeker_E has applied and stated that Company_C is their top preference (Rank 1 for them). While Seeker_E is not my absolute top choice (Seeker_B, C, and D are higher), they are still on my list and represent an acceptable match. Furthermore, Seeker_E is the top priority for both Company_A and Company_B. If I reject them now, they will certainly be matched elsewhere immediately. Given that I only have one quota and Seeker_E offers a stable, acceptable match in Round 1, securing this placement is strategically sound. I will accept the application."
