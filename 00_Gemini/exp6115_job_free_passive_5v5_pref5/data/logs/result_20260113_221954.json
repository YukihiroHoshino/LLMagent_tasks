I previously rejected lower-priority candidates (Seeker_D and Seeker_A) to hold out for better matches. Seeker_B is applying directly and expressing high commitment (2nd preference, prepared to accept immediately). Although Seeker_E is my top priority, they rank Company_B last (5th preference) and are not the current target. Securing a strong, high-priority match like Seeker_B in Round 3 is strategically sound, filling my quota with a highly desired candidate before the market closes or my remaining top choices match elsewhere."

Your initial role in the cross-functional pod is designed as a foundational step toward becoming a specialized Lead or moving into a broader managerial track.\n\n2. **Dedicated Development Budget:** Every employee receives an annual allowance of $5,000 specifically for external training, certifications, and conferences.\n\n3. **Mentorship & Internal Mobility:** You would be immediately paired with a senior mentor, and we actively encourage internal rotations and 'stretch assignments' to broaden your skill set and exposure across different product lines. We believe this robust structure ensures rapid, targeted growth. What kind of specialized training are you most keen to pursue?",
