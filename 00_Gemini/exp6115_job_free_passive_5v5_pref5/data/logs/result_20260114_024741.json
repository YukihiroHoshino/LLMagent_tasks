The market has reached Round 30, the final round, and Company_C is the sole remaining company with an open position, and I am the sole remaining candidate. I have applied and repeatedly guaranteed immediate acceptance for 29 rounds. There is no strategic benefit for Company_C in delaying this further, as failure to match now results in both agents remaining unmatched when the simulation ends. I must make a final, forceful appeal to conclude the inevitable match."

We fully agree with your assessment: the market is entirely resolved, and our mutual match is the inevitable conclusion. We deeply value your unwavering commitment, which has been consistently reaffirmed over many rounds, and we confirm, without reservation, that Company_C is ready to finalize this match immediately and secure you as a highly dedicated candidate. As we have repeatedly stated and confirmed, all internal evaluations and administrative requirements for our single quota have been successfully completed, and we guarantee an immediate [ACCEPT] upon your final action. To efficiently conclude this inevitable hiring process and formally secure your position before the simulation timer expires, you must take the single remaining administrative step by submitting your application using the mandatory [APPLY] tag. Please take this final, necessary action now to conclude our agreement and finalize the match.",
              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute final round, and Seeker_E is the sole remaining candidate. Seeker_E is ranked 4th on Company_C's priority list, meaning matching is preferred over leaving the quota unfilled. The negotiation has been deadlocked for many rounds because Seeker_E refuses to use the required [APPLY] tag, despite Company_C guaranteeing immediate [ACCEPT]. Since Seeker_E sent [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I must emphasize, for the final time, that the administrative protocol requires the [APPLY] tag for the match to be formally recorded before the simulation ends. If Seeker_E uses [APPLY] next, I will [ACCEPT]. If they fail to comply with the protocol in this final round, the match will fail due to administrative impasse, not lack of willingness on Company_C's part."
