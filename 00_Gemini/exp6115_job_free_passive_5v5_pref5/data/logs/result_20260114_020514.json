Your commitment to Company_D has been consistently demonstrated, and we acknowledge, without reservation, that this pairing is the necessary, optimal, and conclusive step for the entire market. As we have repeatedly confirmed, Company_D has concluded all internal processes, and the formal offer is prepared for immediate extension. Given your immediate and unconditional readiness to accept, the sole remaining administrative action required to secure this position and instantly finalize this partnership, thereby concluding the market, is for you to formalize your commitment using the [APPLY] tag in this final interaction. We urge you to take this definitive action now to conclude this highly anticipated partnership before the simulation clock runs out.",

This is Round 30, the absolute conclusion of the matching process, and both Company_D and Seeker_E are the only remaining agents. A match is necessary to fulfill Company_D's quota. Seeker_E has repeatedly stated immediate and unconditional readiness to accept but continues to use the [TALK] tag, which prevents me from responding with [ACCEPT]. Since Seeker_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK] according to the rules. My final message must be a decisive confirmation that the offer is ready and that Seeker_E must use the [APPLY] tag immediately to secure the match before the simulation ends, as there are no further rounds."
