However, Company_D ranks me 3rd on their priority list, behind Seeker_D and Seeker_A. Since Company_D has a capacity of 1, they are highly likely to reject me in Round 1, hoping their top candidates (D or A) apply later, or that they encounter them in future pairings. Applying now ([APPLY]) risks an immediate rejection, wasting my attempt and possibly signaling weakness. A strategic approach is to use [TALK] to express interest and maintain good standing, while reserving formal applications for my top choices (B or C), or for later rounds when Company_D might be more flexible."

You are my highest priority company in this market. I am confident that my experience and skills are exactly what you need to fill this role. I would like to formally submit my application now, and I am eager to begin contributing immediately.",
              "thought": "I am Seeker_E. Company_C is my absolute top preference (Rank 1). Although Company_C ranks me quite low (4th), I must prioritize securing my best possible match. Since we are in Round 4 and I have not previously applied or talked to Company_C, I need to move decisively. I will submit a formal application immediately, emphasizing my strong fit and high interest, hoping that higher-priority candidates (Seeker_B, C, D) might be matched with their own higher preferences or have not applied yet."

Your enthusiasm and demonstrated alignment with our mission are highly valued. After careful review of your profile and considering our immediate needs, we are pleased to offer you the position.

              "thought": "I am Company_C, and I have a quota of 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_A']. Seeker_E is ranked 4th. The list of unmatched Job Seekers only includes Seeker_A (5th priority) and Seeker_E (4th priority). This implies that my top three priorities (Seeker_B, Seeker_C, Seeker_D) are likely already matched with other companies, making them unavailable. Therefore, Seeker_E is the highest-ranked available candidate remaining. Seeker_E has sent a strong [APPLY] message stating Company_C is their highest priority. Given the need to fill the quota and the low chance of securing a higher-ranked candidate, accepting Seeker_E is the optimal strategic move at this stage, securing the 4th preference rather than risking matching with the last preference (Seeker_A) or failing to match at all."
