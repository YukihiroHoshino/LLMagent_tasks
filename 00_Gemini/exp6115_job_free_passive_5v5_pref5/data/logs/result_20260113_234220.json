Seeker_C has proactively sent an [APPLY] message in Round 1, indicating strong interest, although I am their 3rd choice overall. While my top targets (Seeker_D and Seeker_A) are still available, securing a high-mid priority candidate in the first round is a strategically safe move, especially since Seeker_C is also highly ranked by Company_C (2nd choice) and Company_B (3rd choice). If I delay, I risk losing Seeker_C without securing a higher match. Given the strong application and Seeker_C's position on my list, I will accept the application immediately to secure the match."
