Seeker_D has sent an [APPLY] tag, giving me a direct opportunity to secure this high-priority match. Although Seeker_E is ranked higher, securing Rank 2 immediately is a very strong outcome, especially since I only have one spot. Rejecting Seeker_D to wait for Seeker_E carries the risk of ending up with a much lower-ranked candidate if Seeker_E matches elsewhere. I will accept Seeker_D."
