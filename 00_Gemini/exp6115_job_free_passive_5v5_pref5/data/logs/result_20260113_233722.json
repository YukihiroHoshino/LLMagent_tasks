Company_D's priority list places me 4th: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']. Although I am not their top choice, securing a Rank 2 match in Round 1 is a strong outcome. Given the decentralized nature of negotiations and the capacity of 1, I must apply immediately to maximize my chance of securing this highly preferred position before their higher-priority candidates potentially interact with them later or before I miss the opportunity.

My top two priorities (Seeker_D and Seeker_A) list Company_D as their last choice (5th), making it highly unlikely I will secure them early. My 3rd priority, Seeker_C, is also likely to match with Company_B or Company_C before reaching me. Given that securing a highly interested candidate (2nd preference) guarantees a match in Round 1, and the risk of holding out for a marginal improvement (Seeker_C) might lead to zero matches, I will accept Seeker_E."

A better strategy is to use [TALK] to signal interest and gather information, while reserving my formal [APPLY] tags for my higher-ranked preferences or for later rounds when the market clears up.
