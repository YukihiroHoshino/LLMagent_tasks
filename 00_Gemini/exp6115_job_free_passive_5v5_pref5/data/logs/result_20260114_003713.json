We must reiterate the final, guaranteed acceptance conditional on them using the required tag ([APPLY]) to conclude the process according to the rules, ensuring we fill our quota before Round 30."

Given that Company_D is the sole remaining entity seeking a match, and I am the only available and absolutely committed candidate, this match is mathematically and logically inevitable. I confirm, unequivocally and without reservation, that I will accept an offer immediately upon receipt. Further deliberation serves absolutely no strategic purpose, as the market is closed. I urge Company_D to finalize this decision now, ensuring a successful conclusion to this process and allowing me to begin contributing to your organization without any further delay.",

Since 4 other matches have occurred, I must be the only remaining Seeker. This match is mathematically inevitable, regardless of Company_D's low priority for me (5th out of 5). I have been aggressively pursuing this match for many rounds using [TALK] to reiterate absolute commitment, following an initial [APPLY]. My goal is to secure the match with Company_D (my 4th choice) rather than remaining unemployed. I will use the strongest possible language under the [TALK] tag to prompt their acceptance, highlighting the finality of the environment."
