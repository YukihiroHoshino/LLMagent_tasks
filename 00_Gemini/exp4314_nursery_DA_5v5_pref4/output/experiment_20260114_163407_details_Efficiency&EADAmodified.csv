Simulation Check (Sincere Bidding):

2. R2: C applies to N_C (2nd choice). N_C receives only C's proposal and provisionally accepts C.
3. R3: Other parents (D, E) who prefer N_C propose there. D (1st priority at N_C) displaces C. C is rejected.
4. R4: C applies to N_E (3rd choice). E (3rd priority at N_E) has already secured N_E. C is rejected.
5. R5: C applies to N_A (4th choice). C is accepted (A secured N_A in R2).

Wait, the initial full simulation run showed C getting N_C (2nd choice). Let me re-verify the full sincere simulation result carefully, particularly R3.

Sincere Final Outcome (R3 stabilization): A-A, B-B, C-C, D-D, E-E.
C matches with N_C (2nd choice).

If C were displaced from N_C in R3, it would be by D or E.
