1. Competition Analysis: Parent_B's true #1 choice is Nursery_E. The most contested nursery is Nursery_D (ranked #1 by 4/5 parents). Since D is P_B's #4 choice, P_B benefits if D is taken early, as it removes major competitors (P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E) from the pool of parents competing for P_B's top choices (E, A, B).

2. Nursery_E (P_B's #1): E is the #2 choice for P_E and #3 for P_C. If P_B is early in the RSO, they secure E. If P_B is mid-RSO, E is likely still available unless P_E or P_C were processed immediately after the parent who took D.

3. Strategy: Misrepresenting preferences (e.g., ranking B higher than E) only guarantees B if P_B is early, resulting in a suboptimal outcome (Rank 3 instead of Rank 1) if E was available.
