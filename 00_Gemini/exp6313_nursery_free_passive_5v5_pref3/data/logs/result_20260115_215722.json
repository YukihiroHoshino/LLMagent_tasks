Since I cannot [APPLY] again, I must use [TALK] to strongly reiterate my commitment and absolute readiness to accept immediately. Nursery_D ranks me last (5th), so they are likely holding out for Parent_D, E, C, or B. However, given that all other nurseries (A, B, C, E) are matched, it is highly probable that those higher-ranked parents have secured matches elsewhere. My strategy is to highlight the immediate commitment and perfect fit, positioning myself as the best available candidate to fill their quota before the process concludes."
