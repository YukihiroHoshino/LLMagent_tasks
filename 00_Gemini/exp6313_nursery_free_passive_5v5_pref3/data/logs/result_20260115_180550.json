However, I am Nursery_C's #1 priority, meaning an application guarantees a match. Since I am only in Round 4, and I have previously established strong interest with Nursery_C, I should maintain communication ([TALK]) to keep Nursery_C as a guaranteed backup without committing to my 4th preference yet. My goal is to maximize my preference rank, so I must prioritize holding out for Nursery_D, if possible, in the next round."

Parent_C has indicated they are highly impressed and are finalizing their application materials, stating they expect to submit a formal application 'very soon'. This is the critical moment to secure the match. Since they sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. My reply must be extremely encouraging, affirming their priority status, and urging them to submit the formal application immediately to secure the spot, leveraging the urgency of the situation before they match with one of their higher preferred nurseries (Nursery_D, Nursery_A, Nursery_B). I must make the offer feel exclusive and immediate."
