Given that I am ranked last (5th) on Nursery_B's priority list, it is highly likely that the four parents ranked above me have already matched elsewhere, making me Nursery_B's highest available and last remaining option. My strategy must be to use the extreme lateness of the round (28/30) to pressure them into accepting my application based on mutual necessity and guaranteed commitment. I have already applied once and followed up with numerous talks, so I will continue with a strong [TALK] message emphasizing the finality of the opportunity."
