Given Parent_C's persistent re-application and commitment (Nursery_D is their absolute top choice), securing a Rank 3 match now is a prudent strategic move, as waiting for Parent_D or Parent_E is highly risky and likely to result in settling for a lower-ranked Parent (Rank 4 or 5) or remaining unmatched.
