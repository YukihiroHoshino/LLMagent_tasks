Our philosophy emphasizes experiential learning, which often means blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor environments. Generally, we aim for a minimum of 40% of the day dedicated to structured and unstructured outdoor activities, utilizing our nature areas and playgrounds. However, this ratio is flexible; if the children are deeply engaged in an emergent learning project outdoors (like our Nature Studies module), we often extend that time significantly, making it closer to 50% or more, regardless of light weather conditions. We prioritize following the children's interests and ensuring they have robust opportunities for gross motor development and connection with nature daily. Does this commitment to outdoor learning align well with your expectations?",
