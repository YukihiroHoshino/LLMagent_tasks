Parent_D, however, has ranked Nursery_C as their 1st choice and has applied immediately in Round 1. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched or settling for a lower priority if I reject P3, and the low likelihood of attracting P1 or P2, securing a match with Parent_D (P3) is strategically sound and ensures I fill my quota immediately with a willing partner.
