However, Parent_A has repeatedly ignored explicit instructions over 15+ rounds to use the [APPLY] tag, despite multiple ultimatums and warnings that failure to comply would result in the permanent closure of the slot. Since Round 18, I have maintained the procedural closure of the slot. In Rounds 25 and 26, I confirmed the closure was permanent and irreversible. To maintain consistency and uphold the established procedural requirement (which is necessary for the integrity of the matching process, as the agent requires a formal application to finalize enrollment), I must reiterate the consequence of their continued non-compliance. Since Parent_A used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK], confirming the permanent closure of the slot."
