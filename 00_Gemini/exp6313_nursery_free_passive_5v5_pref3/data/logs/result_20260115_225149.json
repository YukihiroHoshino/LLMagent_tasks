I have P1 priority at N_C and P2 priority at N_E (likely P1 among remaining unmatched parents). My optimal strategy is to secure N_C (Rank 4). If I apply to N_E now, I match with my 5th choice, which is suboptimal if N_C is still available. I should use [TALK] to keep N_E interested, recognizing my favorable priority (P2 overall), while saving my application opportunity for N_C in a subsequent round. Since I have talked extensively with N_E before, I will frame this as a final appreciation and check-in."

I am in Round 8, and the history suggests I have been rejected or ignored by higher preferences (like Nursery_B). Critically, Parent_C is the 2nd highest priority for Nursery_E ('Parent_C' is 2nd on Nursery_E's list). Given the advanced round and the high likelihood of acceptance, securing this match is prudent, assuming higher options (D, A, B, C) are now unavailable or have rejected me. I have already engaged in four 'TALK' rounds with Nursery_E, so further talking is unnecessary. I will formally apply now to secure a match."

Parent_C has expressed strong interest throughout our extensive conversation history and has now formally applied.
