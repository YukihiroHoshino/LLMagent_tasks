However, Nursery_A ranks me (Parent_E) 4th out of 5 parents on its priority list (P_B, P_D, P_A, P_E, P_C). Given that this is Round 1 and parents ranked higher than me (P_B, P_D, P_A) are likely to be applying or talking to their top choices, Nursery_A has strong incentives to hold out for a better applicant. Applying now ([APPLY]) would almost certainly result in a [REJECT] and waste an application slot.
