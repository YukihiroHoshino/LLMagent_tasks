We foster independence primarily through our 'Choice Time' and 'Learning Centers.' Children are given autonomy to select activities, which teaches them decision-making skills and ownership over their learning path. Critical thinking is integrated through project-based learning. Instead of simple instruction, teachers pose open-ended questions and challenges that require children to observe, hypothesize, test solutions, and reflect on outcomes, often collaboratively. For example, a project on building stability might involve testing various materials and designs, encouraging true problem-solving and analytical thought. We believe this approach builds confidence and resilience essential for future academic success.

Regarding your request for final steps to formalize your interest: the crucial next step is the immediate submission of your formal application. We reiterate that once this application is received, we will review it promptly, generally within 48 hours, and notify you of our decision. Given the dynamic nature of the allocation phase and our limited remaining spot, we strongly advise highly motivated families, such as yours, to proceed with their commitment ([APPLY]) without delay to secure consideration. We look forward to reviewing your final commitment.",

Parent_E has engaged in extensive conversation and is now repeatedly asking about formalizing their interest and timelines, indicating high readiness to apply. Since Parent_E has initiated [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. My strategy is to strongly encourage Parent_E to submit a formal application ([APPLY]) immediately, reiterating the urgency due to the limited quota. This maximizes the chance of securing a match with a highly ranked parent (P4) while still leaving the door open for Parent_A (P1) if they contact me first and apply, although P4 is a strong option to secure now."
