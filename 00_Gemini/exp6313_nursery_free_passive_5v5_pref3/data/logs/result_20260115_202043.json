Nursery_E ranks me 4th ('Parent_E') on their priority list, meaning I am not a strong candidate for them. Since all other desirable nurseries (C, B, A, D) are presumably matched, I must secure this spot to avoid being unmatched. I previously used [TALK] to gather information. Now, in Round 4, I must convert that interest into a firm commitment via [APPLY] to overcome my low priority ranking and secure the match before Parent_D (who is ranked 5th by E) potentially applies."

While Parent_E is not my top choice, they have formally applied and expressed full commitment. Reviewing the market, Nursery_E is the 4th or 5th choice for all Parents, meaning my top priorities (Parent_A, Parent_C) are highly unlikely to apply unless they are rejected everywhere else. Securing a match now, even with the 4th priority parent, is a strong strategic move to guarantee filling my quota, rather than risking remaining unmatched by holding out for parents who rank me last. I will accept the application."
