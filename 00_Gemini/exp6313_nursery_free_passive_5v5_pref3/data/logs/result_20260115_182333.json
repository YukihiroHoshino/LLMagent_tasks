This makes Parent_D (#3 priority) the highest priority parent currently available for Nursery_C. Given the extreme lateness of the round, Nursery_C must finalize its placement immediately. My strategy is to issue a final, urgent appeal, emphasizing the guarantee of immediate acceptance and the certainty I provide at this critical juncture. Since I formally applied in Round 1, I will continue using the [TALK] tag to press for an immediate acceptance."

Nursery_C's top two priorities (P_C and P_B) are almost certainly matched to their own top choices (N_D and N_B, respectively), meaning N_C is acting irrationally by holding out. Since I am N_C's 3rd priority and the only remaining available high-priority parent, N_C should accept me immediately.
