They have submitted a formal application and explicitly stated that Nursery_C is their top choice. While Parent_C (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2) are still unmatched, both of them rank Nursery_C very low (Rank 4 and Rank 5, respectively), making it highly unlikely they will apply to me early in the process. Parent_D is a high-quality applicant whom I rank highly. Given that Parent_D is also Rank 1 for Nursery_B and Rank 2 for Nursery_A, rejecting them carries a high risk of losing them entirely without guarantee of securing a higher ranked Parent. Securing a Rank 3 match now is strategically sound. I will accept Parent_D."

Nursery_E ranks me 4th, meaning I am likely to be accepted if I apply, provided the 3 parents ranked above me are not currently applying or are already matched elsewhere.
