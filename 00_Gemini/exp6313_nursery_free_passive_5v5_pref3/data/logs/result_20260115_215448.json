The remaining unmatched nurseries are N_A (3rd choice), N_D (4th choice), and N_E (5th choice). I previously applied to N_A, and the outcome is pending or unknown, but N_A remains unmatched. I need to secure a match now before all desirable options are gone. Crucially, I am Parent_E, and I rank 2nd on Nursery_D's priority list, just behind Parent_D. Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last (5th), meaning they are unlikely to apply unless forced. This gives me a very strong chance to match with N_D immediately. Given the uncertainty surrounding my N_A application, securing N_D (my 4th choice) is a prudent move to avoid dropping to N_E or being unmatched."

While Parent_D (P1) is technically preferred, Parent_D ranks Nursery_D last (P5) and is likely seeking matches elsewhere (Nursery_B ranks Parent_D P1, Nursery_A ranks Parent_D P2). Securing P2 now, when the quota is open, is a strong strategic move, as waiting for the highly unlikely match with P1 risks ending up with a lower-ranked Parent or remaining unmatched.
