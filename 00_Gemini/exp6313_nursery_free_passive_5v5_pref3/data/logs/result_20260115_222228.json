Given that the list of unmatched nurseries only includes A, D, and E, I must assume my top two choices (Nursery_C and Nursery_B) are already matched. This makes Nursery_A my highest remaining priority. I need to apply now before other parents secure the spot.\nHowever, I am ranked 4th out of 5 parents on Nursery_A's priority list (behind B, D, and A). Since D is likely matched elsewhere, the primary threats are Parent_B (1st priority) and Parent_A (3rd priority). Both Parent_A and Parent_B likely also prioritize Nursery_A highly among the remaining schools. To maximize my chances in this competitive environment, I must formally apply immediately and show strong commitment, hoping to secure the spot before a higher-ranked parent applies."

Since it is only Round 3 and the highest priority parents are still available in the market, Nursery_A must hold out for a better match to maximize utility. Therefore, the application must be rejected."

Parent_E (Rank 2) has only engaged in exploratory conversation [TALK] and hasn't applied yet. Furthermore, Parent_E ranks Nursery_D 4th overall, suggesting they are pursuing other options (Nursery_C, B, A) first.\n\nSecuring Parent_C (Rank 3) now is a guaranteed, high-quality match that fulfills my quota.
