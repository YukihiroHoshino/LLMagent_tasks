We foster this integration through dedicated learning centers where children engage in dramatic play (building narrative and dialogue skills), and through project-based activities that require reading simple instructions or labeling their creations (developing print awareness). Our teachers are skilled in 'scaffolding' play, gently introducing phonological awareness games and vocabulary expansion naturally within the play environment.
