Numeracy is integrated through authentic experiences like cooking (measuring), building blocks (spatial reasoning and counting), and sorting natural materials (classification). This approach ensures that these foundational skills are developed meaningfully and joyfully, aligning perfectly with our holistic philosophy.

On Day 1, we encourage the parent to stay for a brief period before leaving for just 30 minutes, allowing the child to experience separation and reunion quickly.

We also utilize our digital communication platform to send frequent, positive updates specifically during drop-off and the first few hours, providing reassurance that your child is adjusting well.
