Regarding your question about the daily rhythm, after lunch, quiet time and rest/nap time commence, typically running from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. We prioritize flexibility within routine: every child is provided a comfortable space for rest, but we respect individual needs. Children who do not require a nap engage in quiet, solitary activities such as looking at books or working on soft puzzles on their mat, ensuring a restful environment for all. We believe this dedicated rest period is vital for a successful afternoon session. We are happy to discuss any specific needs you might have regarding this schedule.",

The current situation indicates that only Nursery_E remains unmatched, suggesting that my higher preferences (A, B, C, D) are likely already filled. To avoid being unmatched, I must apply to Nursery_E. Furthermore, Nursery_E ranks me second ('Parent_C'), giving me a high chance of acceptance.

My top priority, Parent_A, ranks me last (5th) and is highly likely to be matched by one of their higher-ranked choices (Nursery_A, B, C, or D). If I reject Parent_C, I risk losing a high-priority match while waiting for Parent_A, who is unlikely to apply to me. Parent_C has applied with an 'unwavering commitment.'
