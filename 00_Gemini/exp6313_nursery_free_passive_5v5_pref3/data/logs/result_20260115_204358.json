While we offer formal communication channels, we also focus heavily on building a warm, collaborative community through various events. Throughout the year, we host several major events, including an annual Family Fun Day, seasonal cultural celebrations (where families share traditions), and specific volunteer days for classroom activities or garden maintenance. We also run ongoing 'Parent-Expert' sessions, where parents are invited to share their professional skills or hobbies with the children. We believe this blend of formal support and informal community building ensures that Parent_E truly feels like an extended family. Does this sound like the supportive community environment you are seeking?",

Since there are only two nurseries left unmatched (B and E), it is highly likely that my top three preferences (A, C, D) are already matched with other parents. Given my high priority at Nursery_B, this is an excellent opportunity to secure a match before the 1st priority parent (Parent_D) or 3rd priority parent (Parent_B) makes a move, especially since Parent_D might be unmatched and competing. Securing my 4th choice now minimizes risk. I will formally apply."
