However, my priority at Nursery_B is low (4th). I have already engaged in two rounds of 'TALK' to signal high interest. Since the goal is to match with the highest possible preference, I must now formally apply, despite the low priority, to see if the higher-ranked parents (P_D, P_A, P_B) have been matched elsewhere. If I am rejected, I can pursue my 4th choice, Nursery_C, where I hold the 1st priority, in the subsequent round.
