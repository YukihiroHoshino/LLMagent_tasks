I have already applied to Nursery_B, which is still unmatched. Nursery_D is my 4th preference. Critically, Nursery_D ranks me (Parent_E) as their 2nd highest priority (after Parent_D). Given that my top two choices (C, A) are likely matched elsewhere, and my application to B is pending/unaccepted, securing a match with D, where I have high priority, is a good safety move. I should proceed with a formal application to D to lock in my 4th choice."

Nursery_B is my 4th preference, but I am 2nd on their priority list, making a match highly probable if I apply.

Parent_A has been positive but is clearly still evaluating higher preferences (Nursery_A, C, D). They used [TALK] and indicated they are 'finalizing our overall assessment' and 'look forward to potentially moving forward very soon.' This is a strong signal that they might apply next round, or apply to a higher preference school. My strategy is to reaffirm my high interest in them (since they are P2) and gently push for an application by emphasizing the strength of our fit and the urgency of the process, without giving them an actual offer yet (as they haven't applied)."
