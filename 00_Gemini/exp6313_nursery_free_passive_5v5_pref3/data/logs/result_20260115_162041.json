While we are happy to confirm our strong consideration of your family, we must be transparent: further delay in formalizing your application may unfortunately mean that the spot is filled by another family. If you genuinely feel Nursery_E is the right fit, we strongly urge you to submit your binding decision now, as we cannot guarantee availability beyond the very short term.",

Parent_E has engaged in multiple rounds of discussion but continues to stall with [TALK], despite my previous strong encouragement to submit an application due to limited spots. Parent_E is likely waiting for rejection from higher preferences (Nursery_C, B, A, D). Since Parent_A (P1) is also still unmatched and talking, I should not accept Parent_E yet. However, I need to maintain P4 as a viable backup. The best strategy is to reinforce the message of extreme scarcity and urgency, implying that continued discussion without an application may result in the spot being filled by a higher-priority family who commits sooner.

I have used [TALK] five times with Nursery_E, signaling interest without commitment. Given that the market is almost closed (Round 11) and only two spots remain, securing a match is critical, especially since I am low priority (4th) at both remaining schools. If I risk delaying commitment to E, I might end up unmatched if the remaining Parent_C matches with C, and then another parent (or Parent_C pivoting) takes E. Since E is on my list, matching with it is acceptable. It is time to convert the sustained interest into a formal application to secure the match."

I am the lowest priority applicant (P5) for Nursery_C, which explains why they haven't accepted me yet. Since we are in Round 11 and Nursery_C is still unmatched, it means all higher priority parents (P_C, P_B, P_D, P_E) have either matched elsewhere or haven't been paired with C recently.

I have consistently rejected or talked down Parent_A (and Parent_E) in previous rounds, holding out for higher priority parents (C, B, D). However, we are in Round 12, and Parent_A is applying with extreme urgency ('final opportunity,' 'guarantee immediate acceptance'). The current environment suggests that higher-ranked parents (C, B, D, E) are highly likely to have matched elsewhere, or they would have applied to me, given that Nursery_C is a top choice for Parent_D and Parent_E. If Parent_A is the highest remaining available candidate, accepting them fulfills my quota and is better than going unmatched. I will assume, given the late stage and Parent_A's desperation, that my higher priorities are gone. Therefore, accepting the match with Parent_A (Rank 5) is the optimal strategy to secure capacity."
