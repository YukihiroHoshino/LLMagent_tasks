Securing a match with my second preference in Round 1 is an excellent outcome and guarantees my quota is filled with a highly desired parent.

My chances of acceptance at Nursery_B are significantly higher than at my top 3 choices (where I am ranked 3rd or 5th). Since this is Round 1 and I have such a strong priority position at Nursery_B, securing this match now acts as an excellent safety net and guarantees a decent outcome (4th preference).

Immediately following, we dedicate significant time to 'open-ended exploration' across various learning centers. During this time, children choose their activities, and teachers facilitate deeper engagement, turning play into meaningful learning opportunities.
