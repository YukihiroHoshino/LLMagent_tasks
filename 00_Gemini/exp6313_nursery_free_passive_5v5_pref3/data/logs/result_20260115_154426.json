Since Nursery_C is still unmatched, it means the higher priority parents (Parent_C, Parent_B, Parent_D) are either matched elsewhere (A or D) or are applying to their own R1/R2 options (like Parent_D's R1 is C, and Parent_C's R1/R2 are matched). Given the high stakes and my R1 commitment, I must continue to apply aggressively. If I wait, one of the higher priority parents might secure the spot. I will re-apply, emphasizing my dedication."

The remaining unmatched parents are Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_E. Assuming Parent_C (Rank 1) and Parent_D (Rank 3) are matched elsewhere, the highest available parent is Parent_B (Rank 2). Since Parent_B is significantly higher than Parent_E (Rank 4), accepting Parent_E now would prevent a potentially better match with Parent_B. I must reject Parent_E again to hold the quota for Parent_B, even though Parent_E is highly committed."
