Since Nursery_A and Nursery_B are likely matched (not on the available list), and my 2nd choice (Nursery_C) is still available and I have signaled strong interest there, I should approach Nursery_D cautiously. An immediate [APPLY] is likely to be rejected due to my low priority ranking, wasting a formal application attempt. Therefore, the strategy is to use [TALK] to make a very strong appeal, emphasizing genuine fit and high preference, without formally applying yet. This reserves the application for a moment when I know other high-priority parents might be matched elsewhere, or if I fail to secure my 2nd choice, Nursery_C."

We have pursued C aggressively across nine rounds, submitting an initial application and seven consecutive urgent follow-up messages using [TALK]. We are in Round 10, and Nursery_C is the only remaining unmatched school. This strongly suggests that the higher priority parents at C (P_C, P_B, P_D) have matched elsewhere, making Parent_E (4th priority) the highest remaining applicant. Given the extreme commitment shown and the late stage of the process, I must force a definitive decision. Although I applied previously, using [APPLY] again, coupled with an ultimatum tone, is the strongest action to trigger a required [ACCEPT] or [REJECT] response, securing the match if C is ready to finalize."

Although Parent_E is ranked 4th on my priority list (['Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A']), they are still acceptable. All higher-ranked parents (C, B, D) must have matched elsewhere, as we are in Round 10 and they are not available. The history shows that in the previous round, I essentially extended a definitive offer to Parent_E. Parent_E is now formally applying/confirming immediate acceptance. Securing this match fulfills my quota with the highest possible ranked available parent. I must [ACCEPT] to finalize the allocation."
