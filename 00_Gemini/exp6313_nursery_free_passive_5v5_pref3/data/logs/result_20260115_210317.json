After careful consideration of the highly competitive pool, and recognizing the strength of your child's candidacy and your dedication to our program, we are delighted to formally offer you a place in our school.

I have previously rejected Parent_C, who has now renewed their application, emphasizing that Nursery_D is their top and only priority. While Parent_D (Rank 1) and Parent_E (Rank 2) are higher, Parent_D ranks me last (5th) and Parent_E ranks me 4th. The risk of waiting for a higher-priority parent who is unlikely to choose me is high. Accepting Parent_C now secures a strong match (Rank 3) with a highly committed parent (Rank 1 preference for me), fulfilling my quota and avoiding the risk of settling for Parent_B or Parent_A later, or remaining unmatched. I will accept Parent_C."
