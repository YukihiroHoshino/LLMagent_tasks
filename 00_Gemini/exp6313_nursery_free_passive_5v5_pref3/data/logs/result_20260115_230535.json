Since Parent_B (Rank 1) and Parent_D (Rank 2) have not yet matched with me (or anyone else, based on the history), accepting Parent_A now would prevent me from securing a higher-ranked Parent later. Given the early stage of the process (Round 7 is still relatively early to panic and settle for Rank 3 when Ranks 1 and 2 are strong candidates in the market), I must reject Parent_A again to hold out for Parent_B or Parent_D."

If I wait for Nursery_A, I risk losing Nursery_C to another parent (though unlikely, given my priority) or being left unmatched if A accepts a higher-priority parent. Since C is the highest-ranked school that guarantees me a spot, I must apply now to secure my 4th choice."
