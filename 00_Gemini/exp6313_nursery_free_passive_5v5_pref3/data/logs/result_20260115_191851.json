For core learning activities, we often employ station-based learning, allowing children to rotate through various areas (literacy, numeracy, creative arts) at their own pace and depth. To manage diverse learning speeds, we rely heavily on continuous observation and scaffolding. If a child demonstrates mastery quickly, their key worker introduces enrichment activities tailored to their interests.
