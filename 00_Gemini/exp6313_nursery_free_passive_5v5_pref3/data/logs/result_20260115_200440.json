Nursery_D is my 4th choice, but given that only N_D and N_E remain unmatched (implying N_A, N_B, N_C are likely taken), N_D is now my highest available option. Crucially, I am Parent_E, ranked 2nd on Nursery_D's priority list, which gives me a very strong chance of acceptance, especially if Parent_D (ranked 1st) has matched elsewhere (which is likely if the top 3 nurseries are gone, as D prefers C, A, B). Since this is Round 4 and N_D is the best remaining option, I must apply immediately to secure the match."

While Parent_D is my absolute top choice, Parent_D ranks me last (5th) and securing them is highly uncertain, especially given the competition. Parent_E is a high-value match and a bird in the hand. Securing Parent_E now guarantees a strong outcome (Rank 2 match) and fulfills my quota early. I should accept this application immediately."
