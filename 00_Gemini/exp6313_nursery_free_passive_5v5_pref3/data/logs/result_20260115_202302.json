Parent_E previously sent a strong [APPLY] message, but Nursery_C is still unmatched, indicating either a rejection or deferral due to higher priority candidates (P_C, P_B, P_D). Since the previous application was definitive, sending another [APPLY] might be repetitive or ineffective if the rejection was priority-based. My goal is to maintain strong commitment and active engagement while probing the status, hoping that the higher priority parents might match elsewhere. Therefore, using [TALK] to follow up and strongly reiterate top preference is the best strategy for this round."

Parent_D specifically prefers me first, making them a prime target. Since Parent_E is only sending a [TALK] message this round, I must reciprocate with [TALK].
