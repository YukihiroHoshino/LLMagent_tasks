However, looking at Nursery_B's priority list, Parent_E is ranked 5th out of 5 (lowest priority). If any of the four higher priority parents (D, A, B, C) apply in this round, I will be rejected immediately if I apply. Since this is Round 1, applying directly carries a very high risk of immediate rejection, which limits future negotiations or the ability to apply elsewhere strategically. Given the low priority, the best course of action is to use [TALK] to express strong interest and keep the option open, while waiting to see if higher-priority parents match elsewhere in subsequent rounds, thereby improving my chances later."
