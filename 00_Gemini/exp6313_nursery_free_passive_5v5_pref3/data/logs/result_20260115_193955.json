Nursery_E is my 5th and lowest preference. The current situation indicates that Nursery_E is the only nursery school not yet matched. This strongly suggests that Nursery_A, B, C, and D are already matched, and Parent_E is currently unmatched (as I am still negotiating). Since Nursery_E is on my preference list, and it is the only remaining option, I must formally apply now to secure a spot, rather than risk remaining unmatched. I have already engaged in four rounds of detailed 'TALK' with Nursery_E, setting the stage for a definitive commitment."

We are delighted to formally offer you placement at Nursery_E. Welcome to our community!",

Parent_E is ranked 4th, meaning they are acceptable but not my top choice. However, the current situation indicates that Parent_E is the only parent listed as 'not yet matched,' suggesting that my higher-ranked preferences (Parent_A, C, B) are likely matched elsewhere or unavailable. Since Parent_E has formally applied and is on my priority list, accepting them is the optimal strategy to secure my remaining quota and avoid remaining unmatched, especially in Round 7."
