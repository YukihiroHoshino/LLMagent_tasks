The student ranked 1st by School_A (Student_B) has School_E as their top preference, and the student ranked 3rd (Student_A) also prefers School_E. It is highly probable that Student_B and Student_A will target School_E.\nTherefore, applying to School_A now provides a strong chance of securing my second-highest preference immediately, which is crucial given the quota of 1 for all schools.

The risk of waiting for Student_A and losing both Student_A (to another school) and Student_C (who might move on) is high.

My top priorities (B, A, D) are highly sought after by School_E (B, A, D all prefer E as Rank 1), and if rejected by E, they have higher ranked options (School_A and School_B) that prioritize them highly, meaning they are unlikely to reach me (where I am Rank 5 for A and D). Rejecting Student_E carries a significant risk of ending up with no match or only Student_C (Rank 5).
