In Round 1, the optimal strategy is to apply immediately to my top choice, hoping to secure the match before other students who might be preferred by School_C are rejected elsewhere and move down their lists. Analyzing the DA dynamics suggests that I might be the only applicant to School_C in Round 1, as the three students preferred over me (B, A, D) all prefer School_E (or School_D, for C). While School_C ranks me 4th, an early application using [APPLY] is crucial for maximizing my chances."

Student_E has applied in Round 1 and listed School_C as their 1st choice. The higher priority students (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) all prefer School_E first and are highly likely to be matched with School_E, School_B, or School_A (their subsequent high choices) in Rounds 1 or 2, as they are highly ranked by those schools as well. Student_A and Student_D both rank School_C as their 5th choice, meaning they are unlikely to apply to School_C unless all four schools above me reject them. Accepting Student_E (P4) now secures a favorable match and prevents School_C from potentially remaining unmatched or having to accept Student_C (P5) much later. I will accept Student_E."
