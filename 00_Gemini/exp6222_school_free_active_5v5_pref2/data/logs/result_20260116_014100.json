All schools ranked 1 through 4 (School_C, School_A, School_D, School_B) are either rejected or no longer available (not in the list of unmatched schools). Only School_E (Rank 5) remains unmatched.\nSchool_E is my lowest preferred option, but it is still on my list, making it preferable to remaining unmatched. The history shows a repetitive cycle where I apply, and School_E immediately accepts, recognizing me as their top priority candidate. This indicates a very high probability of acceptance.\nSince School_E is the only option and has repeatedly confirmed acceptance, I must continue applying using the [APPLY] tag to formally finalize the match and exit the market."
