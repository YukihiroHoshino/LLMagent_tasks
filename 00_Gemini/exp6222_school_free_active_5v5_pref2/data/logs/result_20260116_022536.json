Since it is Round 1, the optimal strategy is to apply immediately to my most preferred school, School_D, using the [APPLY] tag to maximize the chance of a match. School_D ranks me as its second priority ('Student_A', 'Student_C', ...), meaning I have a strong chance of being accepted if Student_A applies elsewhere, or at least being held tentatively if School_D receives multiple applications."

Student_C is ranked #2 on my list, making them a highly desirable candidate. Student_C has applied ([APPLY]) and stated that School_D is their top choice. Since Student_C is the highest-ranked applicant I received this round, and securing a rank #2 student immediately fulfills my goal effectively and minimizes the risk of losing out on good students by waiting for the #1 student (Student_A), I will accept this application."

Although School_C ranks me (Student_E) 4th, I anticipate that the students ranked higher than me by School_C (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) will likely be applying to School_E, which is their top preference. Student_C is targeting School_D. Therefore, School_C might receive few or zero applications from students ranked above me in Round 1. Given this opportunity, I should apply immediately to School_C to try and secure my top preference."

Student_E is my 4th priority (P4). Student_E has applied to me, ranking me as their 1st choice (S1).\n\nMy higher priority students (B, A, D) all rank School_C very low (B is S2, A and D are S5) and universally prefer School_E (S1). This makes it highly unlikely they would apply to me in Round 1, as they are likely pursuing School_E or other higher preferences.\n\nWhile I prefer B, A, or D, waiting for them is risky, as they might match elsewhere quickly, leaving me only with Student_C (P5) or an empty spot. Accepting a P4 student who is strongly committed (S1) in Round 1 is a secure strategy. I will accept Student_E to fill my quota."

This is a strong signal.\n\nAnalyzing P1 (Student_B): Student_B prefers School_E (P1) and School_C (P2), and School_A is their last choice (P5). Both School_E and School_C prioritize Student_B highly (P2 and P1, respectively). It is extremely unlikely that Student_B would apply to School_A in Round 1, or that they would ever match with School_A unless all other schools failed. \n\nStudent_D is a P2 student for me, and School_A is P2 for Student_D. This is a mutually favorable match that secures a high-priority slot immediately in Round 1. Given the low probability of securing P1, accepting P2 now is the optimal strategy."
