We are deeply honored to be your absolute first choice. Given the current configuration of the market and the high value we place on demonstrated commitment, we are now pleased to extend you an offer. We look forward to welcoming you to School_C.",
              "thought": "I am School_C with a quota of 1. My priority list places Student_E as my 4th choice. I have consistently rejected Student_E in previous rounds (1-4) hoping to secure a higher priority student (Student_B, Student_A, or Student_D). Given that we are now in Round 6, and I have received no applications from my top three choices, it is highly probable they have secured matches elsewhere. Student_E's message explicitly states that School_C and Student_E are the sole remaining agents in the market, suggesting a stable convergence has occurred. Since Student_E is on my priority list and accepting them fulfills my quota, the optimal strategy now is to secure this match rather than risk remaining unmatched (quota 0)."
