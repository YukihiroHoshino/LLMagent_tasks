I have received an [APPLY] from Student_C, my 2nd highest priority student. Student_A, my top priority, has not applied.

School_B ranks Student_A as their 1st priority. It is highly likely that Student_A will be matched with School_B this round.\n\nSince Student_C is my second-most preferred candidate, and they have committed by sending an [APPLY] and stating School_D is their 'absolute top choice,' securing this match is a highly stable and desirable outcome, minimizing the risk of remaining unmatched or settling for a much lower-ranked student (D, E, or B).
