While Student_E is not my top priority, my top three candidates (B, A, D) all prefer School_E (Rank 1 for them) and are likely pursuing that option in Round 1. Rejecting Student_E carries the risk of not securing any match, as B, A, and D might match with School_E or other schools they prefer over School_C (C is Rank 2 for B, but Rank 5 for A and D). Given Student_E's high commitment and my acceptable ranking of them (4th), securing this match now fulfills my quota and prevents the risk of being left unmatched or having to accept Student_C (Rank 5) later.
