Student_E, who ranks me as their R1 choice, has submitted an [APPLY] in Round 1.\nStudent_E is my P4 choice. While I would prefer P1, P2, or P3, a quick analysis of their preferences shows they are unlikely to apply to School_C early:\n- Student_B (P1) ranks me R2, preferring School_E (R1).\n- Student_A (P2) ranks me R5, preferring School_E (R1) or School_B (R2).\n- Student_D (P3) ranks me R5, preferring School_E (R1).\nGiven that my higher priority students are highly sought after by schools they prefer more (especially School_E and School_B), waiting for them carries a high risk of being unmatched or only securing P5 later. Student_E is enthusiastic (R1 preference) and ranks reasonably high (P4). Securing P4 immediately with a quota of 1 is a safe and strategic move."

Furthermore, Student_E ranks School_E last (5th), making it very unlikely they will ever apply unless they fail to match elsewhere.\n\nSince Student_B is the highest-ranked applicant currently in the inbox and represents a highly desirable match (Rank 2), securing this match immediately is the best strategy to maximize priority score, especially given the low probability of securing Student_E.

Crucially, School_B prioritizes Student_A (me) as their number one choice.
