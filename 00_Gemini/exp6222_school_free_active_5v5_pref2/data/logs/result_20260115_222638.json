We have completed our comprehensive review of the market evolution and the remaining pool of highly qualified candidates.\nBased on our final assessment, we agree that the landscape has shifted, and we are pleased to confirm that you are the strongest candidate currently available and the best fit for our institution. We are excited to finally offer you admission.\n[ACCEPT]",
              "thought": "I am School_C. My goal is to match with the highest possible priority student within my quota (1). My priority list is: Student_B (P1), Student_A (P2), Student_D (P3), Student_E (P4), Student_C (P5).\nStudent_E (P4) is applying for the fourth time with [APPLY], indicating strong commitment (School_C is their P1 choice). Student_E correctly analyzes that higher priority candidates (P1, P2, P3) are likely matched elsewhere, as none of them have applied to School_C this round, despite School_C being unmatched.\nSince P1, P2, and P3 are unavailable, Student_E (P4) is now the highest available candidate. Delaying further risks remaining unmatched or having to accept Student_C (P5) later. Given the high certainty that the preferred candidates are gone, accepting Student_E secures a mutually beneficial match with the highest remaining priority student."
