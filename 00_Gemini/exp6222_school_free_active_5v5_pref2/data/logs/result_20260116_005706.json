While School_C ranks me 4th (behind Student_B, Student_A, and Student_D), there is a strong strategic reason to apply here immediately.\n\nStudents A, B, and D all rank School_E as their 1st choice. It is highly probable they will apply there in Round 1. School_E will accept Student_B (their 2nd priority, highest among A, B, D applicants). If this happens, A, B, and D will not apply to School_C in Round 1.\n\nStudent_C's 1st choice is School_D. Student_C is likely to apply there and be accepted (School_D ranks C 2nd).\n\nIf A, B, C, and D apply to their respective top choices (E or D), School_C will likely only receive my application (Student_E). Although I am 4th on their priority list, they have an open quota (Capacity 1). Accepting me ensures they fill their spot immediately with a student who ranks them 1st. I will send a formal application [APPLY] to School_C."

My higher priorities (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) all rank School_C low (P2, P5, P5 respectively) and are likely targeting School_E first.

While Student_A is my top priority, Student_A prefers School_E and School_B over me. Both School_E and School_B rank Student_A highly (B ranks A #1, E ranks A #3).
