Student_A's current message is a final procedural check to ensure all internal market simulation protocols reflecting this binding agreement are complete. Since the student used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]. My response must definitively confirm that all necessary protocols are complete, thereby concluding the negotiation loop entirely and securing the placement of my highest-priority student."
