Analyzing the preferences, only Student_E (myself) lists School_C as their Rank 1 choice.

Student_E, my 4th priority, has applied immediately and confirmed I am their absolute top choice (P1 preference). While P1, P2, and P3 are ranked higher, Student_A and Student_D rank School_C 5th, making it unlikely they will apply early. Student_B ranks me 2nd but is likely applying to School_E (P1 preference), which ranks Student_B highly. Since Student_E is a highly motivated and acceptable candidate (P4), securing this match immediately in Round 1 is prudent to ensure I fill my quota optimally, rather than risking ending up unmatched or with a lower-ranked student later."
