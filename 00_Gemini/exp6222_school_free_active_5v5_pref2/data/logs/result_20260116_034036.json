Student_B is my P2, and crucially, they rank School_E as their P1, demonstrating high commitment. Although I accepted Student_B in Round 1 and confirmed their spot was secured in Round 3, the simulation environment still lists Matched Students as empty and Quota as 1. This means the match is not formally finalized, but highly prospective. Student_B is contacting me with [TALK] to inquire about enrollment timelines, reinforcing their commitment.\n\nMy P1 student, Student_E, ranks School_E last (P5), making a successful match with them highly improbable. Therefore, securing Student_B (P2) is the optimal strategy.\n\nSince Student_B sent [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I need to provide a reassuring response regarding the enrollment timeline to maintain Student_B's commitment and finalize the match process internally, without needing a new acceptance tag, as the acceptance was previously granted."
