Student_D (Rank 3 for me) prefers School_E (R1) then School_A (R2). School_A ranks Student_D as R2 (after B, who is likely matched by E). Student_D will likely be accepted by School_A next round. Thus, Student_D is likely lost.\n\nGiven the strong competition for my top three priorities, rejecting Student_E (Rank 4) would likely result in me remaining unmatched, as all higher-ranked students are preferred by other schools where they rank highly.
