Although I am ranked 4th out of 5 students by School_C, the three students ranked above me (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) all list School_E as their number one preference. Given that School_E only has capacity 1, and these students are highly likely to apply there in Round 1, they are unlikely to apply to School_C (which is low on A and D's lists, and 2nd on B's list). Therefore, I have a strong chance of being accepted by School_C in the first round if I apply directly. I will apply to my top choice immediately."

However, Student_A and Student_D rank School_C very low (P5), making it highly unlikely they would apply here or prefer us over their P1/P2 schools (like School_E, School_A, School_B, School_D).\nStudent_B ranks School_C P2, but likely applied to their P1 (School_E), where they are also highly prioritized (P2).\n\nGiven the low likelihood of securing a higher-ranked student, and the certainty of securing a P4 student who views us as their top choice, accepting Student_E now fulfills the quota and achieves a stable match high enough on my list to be satisfactory, avoiding the risk of being left unmatched or forced to accept Student_C (P5) later."
