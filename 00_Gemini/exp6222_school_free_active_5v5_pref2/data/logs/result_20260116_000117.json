Therefore, applying to School_E guarantees a rejection for me.\n\nMy second preference is School_A. I am ranked 2nd by School_A, only behind Student_B. Since Student_B is expected to match with School_E in this round, School_A's highest available candidate becomes me (Student_D).\n\nBy applying immediately to School_A, I maximize my chances of securing my second-best outcome in Round 1, preventing Student_A (3rd rank at School_A) from having a chance to apply later if they are rejected by School_E.
