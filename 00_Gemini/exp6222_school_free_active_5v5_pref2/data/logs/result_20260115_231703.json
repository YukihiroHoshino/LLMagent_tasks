School_C remains my undisputed first choice, and I am prepared to accept immediately. I respectfully request the definitive resolution that was promised, allowing us to finalize this match now.",
              "thought": "School_C is my absolute top preference (#1). Despite four previous applications and rejections/deferrals, School_C remains unmatched in Round 5, indicating that their higher priority candidates (Student_B and Student_A) are likely matched elsewhere or are not applying to School_C. School_C's continuous positive feedback suggests I am their best available option if they cannot secure their top two. I must maintain pressure and commitment, leveraging the fact that they repeatedly promised a definitive answer and have failed to match anyone yet. I will apply formally again, demanding the final decision they have previously deferred."

Your commitment, highlighted by your repeated applications, confirms that School_C is truly the best fit for your goals. After an exhaustive review of the competitive landscape and internal priorities, we are delighted to inform you that we are now prepared to finalize your application. We formally extend an offer of acceptance based on your outstanding qualifications and unwavering commitment to our institution.",
              "thought": "School_C's goal is to maximize the rank of the matched student (Priority List: Student_B, Student_A, Student_D, Student_E, Student_C). Student_E is ranked 4th. We have repeatedly rejected Student_E (5 applications now) hoping to attract higher-ranked candidates (B, A, D). However, B, A, and D all highly prefer School_E, making their application to School_C unlikely in early rounds unless School_E matches elsewhere. Student_E has demonstrated exceptional commitment, confirming School_C as their first choice repeatedly. We are now in Round 5, and the risk of remaining unmatched or losing Student_E to their other options (School_A is 2nd choice) is increasing if we delay further. Since Student_E guarantees a match and is ranked 4th, securing this match now is the optimal strategy to ensure the quota is filled with a competitive candidate, rather than risking an empty quota or having to settle for Student_C (Rank 5) much later. I will accept Student_E."
