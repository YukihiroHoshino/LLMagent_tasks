Student_D prefers School_E (1st choice).\n\nSince School_E is the top choice for the three students preferred by School_C, it is highly likely they will apply there first (especially since School_E ranks Student_E 1st, but S_E is applying to S_C).\n\nIf S_A, S_B, and S_D all apply to S_E, S_E will accept S_B (highest priority among applicants). S_A and S_D will be rejected/unmatched. However, for Round 1, if I apply to School_C, I am likely the highest-ranked applicant School_C receives, allowing me to secure a match immediately.

If I wait for Round 2, I risk losing both Student_A and Student_D to other schools that prioritize them highly, leaving me potentially unmatched or waiting for P5 (Student_C, who likely matched with School_D).\n\nSecuring Student_E (P4), who is highly motivated and lists me as P1, is a strong, stable outcome in Round 1, preventing the risk of an empty quota or a worse match.
