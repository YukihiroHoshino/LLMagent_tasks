Student_E has applied and designated School_C as their absolute first choice, indicating strong commitment.\n\nMy top three candidates (B, A, D) all prioritize School_E first. In Round 1, they are likely applying there. School_E will accept only one student. Student_B is School_E's highest priority among B, A, D, so B is likely matched with E.\n\nThis leaves A (Rank 2) and D (Rank 3) available. However, A and D both rank School_C last (5th). It is highly unlikely they will approach School_C in Round 2, as they will pursue their 2nd/3rd choices (School_B for A, School_A/B for D) first.\n\nRejecting Student_E (Rank 4) carries a significant risk of ending up unmatched or settling for Student_C (Rank 5), as the higher-ranked students are either taken or uninterested. Since Student_E is committed and ranks reasonably high (4th), securing this match is the most prudent move in Round 1."
