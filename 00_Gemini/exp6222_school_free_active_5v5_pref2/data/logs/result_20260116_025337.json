Student_C is the 2nd highest priority student (Rank #2) on School_D's list, just behind Student_A. Student_C has applied directly and stated School_D is their top choice. In Round 1, it is highly likely that Student_A (Rank #1) is applying to their own top choices (School_E or School_B). Since Student_C is highly desired by School_D and has initiated a firm application, accepting them now secures a reliable and high-quality match immediately. Waiting for Student_A carries the risk of losing both Student_A and Student_C if Student_C is accepted elsewhere (though C is low priority for their other choices) or if Student_A doesn't apply to School_D. Securing Rank #2 immediately is the optimal move."

It is highly likely they applied to School_E or another school they prefer in Round 1. Therefore, expecting them to apply to School_C in Round 2 is a significant risk, as they are likely to be accepted by higher ranked schools (like School_E, School_A, or School_B) or will prioritize those schools in Round 2 if rejected by School_E.\n\nSince Student_E is a strong, guaranteed match at P4, accepting them now secures my quota and fulfills the objective of matching with the highest available student who demonstrated interest. Rejecting P4 to gamble on P1, P2, or P3 (who rank me very low) is suboptimal strategy in this market dynamic."
