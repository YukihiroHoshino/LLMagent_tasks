Given the history of strong commitment and the necessity to maintain this valuable P2 relationship, I must reply with [TALK] to reassure them and uphold the integrity of our established agreement. This strategy also continues to reserve the single quota, primarily for P1 (Student_E), or P2 (Student_B) when the time comes for finalization, consistent with previous rejections of Student_A (P3)."
