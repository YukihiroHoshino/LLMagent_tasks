My top three targets (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) are difficult to secure, as they either rank me low (P5 for A and D) or rank School_E higher (P1 for B, A, D). Given that we are in Round 4 and I am still unmatched, and Student_E is highly dedicated, holding out further for P1, P2, or P3 carries significant risk of ending up unmatched or matching with P5. Accepting Student_E (P4) secures a strong, highly committed match. I will accept this application."
