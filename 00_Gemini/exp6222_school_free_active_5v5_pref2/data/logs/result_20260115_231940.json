While Student_A is my top choice, Student_A has higher preferences for other schools (School_E and School_B) and is likely applying there this round. Securing Student_C (R2) immediately is a strong outcome, guarantees a match with a highly motivated student, and minimizes the risk of ending up unmatched or settling for a much lower rank if Student_A is matched elsewhere or never applies to me. I will accept Student_C."

It is highly likely they will apply to School_E or School_D in Round 1. Therefore, School_C might receive few high-priority applications.

Student_E, ranked 4th, has applied with [APPLY] and listed School_C as their absolute top preference (P1 choice for them). While I prefer Student_B, Student_A, and Student_D, their preferences show they are highly unlikely to approach School_C (Student_A/D list School_C as P5, and Student_B lists it as P2, likely applying to their P1, School_E, first). Given the high certainty of securing a P4 match who is strongly committed, and the high risk of ending up unmatched or with a P5 student if I hold out, accepting Student_E now maximizes utility under current market conditions."
