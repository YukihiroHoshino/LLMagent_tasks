It is highly probable that B, A, and D will apply to School_E in Round 1. If they apply to School_E, School_C will receive only my application (assuming Student_C applies elsewhere, likely School_D). Therefore, applying immediately to my top choice, School_C, offers a high chance of immediate acceptance in Round 1, capitalizing on the distribution of preferences among the top-ranked students."

Rejecting E is too risky, as it is highly probable I would remain unmatched or eventually have to settle for Student_C (P5). Given that E applied directly with [APPLY], I will secure the match immediately."
