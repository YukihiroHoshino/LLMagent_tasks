This leaves School_C relatively uncontested in Round 1, likely receiving only my application. Since School_C is my P1 and applying here maximizes my utility in this round without immediate risk of rejection due to higher priority candidates, I will formally apply to School_C."

Student_E is ranked 4th on my priority list, but they have designated School_C as their absolute top preference and have submitted a formal [APPLY] in Round 1. My quota is 1.\n\nMy top candidates (Student_B, Student_A, Student_D) all prefer School_E first. While Student_B ranks me second, Student_A and Student_D rank me fifth. It is highly probable that my top candidates applied to School_E and will be matched there or move to their next preferred school (which is usually not School_C).\n\nRejecting Student_E (Rank 4) carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as the probability of securing Student_B, Student_A, or Student_D in subsequent rounds is low given their preferences. Since Student_E is a strong applicant who has shown maximum commitment to School_C, securing this match now is a prudent strategic move, even though they are not my absolute top priority."
