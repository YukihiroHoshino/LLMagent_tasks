My quota is 1.\n\nStudent_E has applied in Round 1 and ranks me as their absolute first choice. \n\nI need to assess the likelihood of securing a higher-ranked student (B, A, or D). My top 3 priorities all prefer School_E first. Given that School_E also ranks B, A, and D highly (2, 3, 4 respectively), it is very probable that School_E will match with Student_B this round, and A and D will move on to their second choices (School_B and School_A, respectively), where they are also highly desired.\n\nSince my top 3 candidates view me as a low preference (B=2nd, A=5th, D=5th), relying on them to reach me is risky. Accepting Student_E (Rank 4) now guarantees a match with an enthusiastic student, which is preferable to risking an unfilled quota or only getting Student_C (Rank 5). I will accept Student_E."

Student_B, who lists School_E as their top choice, is an excellent match. Rejecting Student_B on the slim chance of matching with Student_E carries significant risk, especially since Student_B is highly desired by School_C (Student_B's second choice, and School_C's top priority).
