While this guarantees a secure match, Student_E is only my 4th preferred student.\n\nThe higher priority students (B, A, D) are very likely applying to their own Rank 1 or Rank 2 schools where they are also highly prioritized (e.g., A is R1 for School_B and School_D; B is R2 for School_E).\n\nIf I accept Student_E now, I forfeit the chance of matching with B, A, or D. The risk of waiting is that I might end up with no match or only Student_C (R5). However, given it is Round 1, I must maximize my potential outcome by signaling high standards and holding out for students ranked 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSince School_C is Student_E's top choice, if they are rejected by their subsequent choices (A, D, B, E), they are likely to return.
