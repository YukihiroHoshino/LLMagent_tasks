While Student_A is my Rank 1, they are unlikely to apply to me in Round 1 as I am only their Rank 3 preference, and they are the Rank 1 priority for School_B (which is their Rank 2 preference). The chance of securing Student_A is low, and the risk of losing Student_C (my Rank 2) by rejecting them is high. Securing a committed, high-ranking student (Rank 2/5) in the very first round is an excellent outcome and maximizes my utility given the market conditions. I will accept Student_C."
