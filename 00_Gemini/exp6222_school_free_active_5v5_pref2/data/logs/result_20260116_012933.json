School_A's third priority, Student_A, is also applying to School_E (A's top choice).\nBy applying to School_A in Round 1, I maximize my chances of securing my Rank 2 preference immediately, as the higher priority applicants for School_A are targeting a different school that is their top choice. This is the safest way to secure a highly ranked match."

Student_A (R2 for C) and Student_D (R3 for C) both rank School_C last (Rank 5).
