While Student_E is extremely enthusiastic (R1 preference for School_C) and persistent, accepting them now (Round 6) closes the door on securing Student_B (R1 TPL) or Student_A (R2 TPL). Student_B ranks School_C as their 2nd choice, making them a very likely candidate once their R1 choice (School_E) is finalized. Given Student_E's demonstrated extreme persistence despite previous rejections, I will reject this application again to hold out for higher-ranked students, specifically Student_B, for at least one more round."

I have repeatedly rejected Student_E recently (R4, R5, R6) while holding out for higher-ranked candidates (B, A, D).
