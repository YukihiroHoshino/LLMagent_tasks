1. Student D's top choice, School E, receives applications from A, B, and D. School E prioritizes B > A > D. School E admits B and rejects D.
2. Student D is rejected by E and applies to the next choice, School A.

Since School D cannot overcome the priority constraints at School E (B is preferred), and submitting true preferences guarantees the best stable match, any strategic deviation (e.g., applying to B first) would not improve the outcome and could potentially lead to a worse match (e.g., if A or C took School A while D was applying to B).

   - Student D prefers School E (Rank 1) over School A (Rank 2).
   - In M, School E is matched to Student B. School E prefers B over D (R_E: E > B > A > D > C). Since E prefers B, D cannot displace B from E, regardless of when D proposes E.
   - If D attempts to propose to A first (misrepresenting preferences), the resulting matching M' still yields D matched to A, as A prefers D over the remaining available students who might propose later. B still secures E immediately.
