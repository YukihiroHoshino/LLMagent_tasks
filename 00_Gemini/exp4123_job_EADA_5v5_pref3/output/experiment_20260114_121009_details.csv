First, I analyze the outcome if all seekers submit their True Preference Lists (L_E). The resulting stable matching M_0 is {(S_B, C_A), (S_D, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. My match is C_D (4th choice).

Rerunning Part 1 with L_A(W1) results in matching M_1: {(S_D, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E)}. My match remains C_D (4th choice).

Second, I analyzed the effect of the Part 2 blocking rule.

Since S_A's temporary admission caused other seekers to be rejected, S_A is penalized by having C_B and then C_A removed from their list in subsequent reruns.

Since the adjustment mechanism (Part 2) relies entirely on the history generated by Part 1, submitting the TPL is generally the safest and most effective strategy to reach the seeker-optimal stable matching, or the best possible outcome under the specific rules.

Simulation Trace (Submitting TPL: ['Company_D', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_C', 'Company_E']):
1. Part 1 (Initial Run): I apply to Company_D (R1) but am rejected later by Seeker_E (R4) due to E's higher priority at D. I eventually match with Company_C (Rank 4).
2. Part 2 Analysis: Seeker_E was identified as a 'blocking Job Seeker' at Company_D because E temporarily admitted there (R4, blocking me) but eventually matched with Company_E (R9). E is forced to waive Company_D.
3. Part 1 (Rerun 1): With E waiving D, I apply to Company_D (R1') and remain admitted there, as E applies elsewhere. The final outcome is a match with Company_D (Rank 1).

Since submitting my TPL leads to a final match with my Rank 1 choice after the full procedure, this is the optimal strategy.",True,Company_D,False,False,1

The matching procedure is a Seeker-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) followed by a 'Blocking Job Seeker' (BJS) check, which triggers preference truncation and a rerun of DA if BJS are found. 

1. Analysis of TPL Submission (Seeker D submits TPL):
Running the DA algorithm with all agents submitting TPLs (Simulation 1) leads to a temporary matching M_TPL = { (S_A, C_E), (S_B, C_A), (S_C, C_C), (S_D, C_B), (S_E, C_D) }. Seeker D receives C_B (Rank 3).

2. BJS Check on M_TPL:
BJS are found (S_D at C_C and C_A, S_A at C_B). This forces preference truncation: S_D removes C_C and C_A, and S_A removes C_B. 

3. Rerun DA (R1):
The rerun DA with modified lists converges to M_R1 = { (S_A, C_E), (S_B, C_A), (S_C, C_D), (S_D, C_B), (S_E, C_C) }. Seeker D receives C_B (Rank 3). Since no BJS are generated during this run, M_R1 is the final outcome if I submit my TPL.

4. Strategic Manipulation Analysis:
I tested various strategic submissions (proposing C_A first, proposing C_B first). In all successful attempts (Simulations 2, 3, 4), the sequence of rejections and temporary admissions led to the exact same set of BJS truncations for S_D (removal of C_C and C_A), resulting in the stable final outcome M_R1, matching S_D to C_B (Rank 3).

Since the stable outcome for the modified preferences (M_R1) appears robustly C_B (Rank 3), and any attempt to secure C_A (Rank 2) is blocked by S_B's higher priority at C_A, submitting the TPL is the optimal strategy as it guarantees the best achievable outcome (Rank 3) while minimizing risk of errors in calculating complex strategic paths.",True,Company_B,False,False,3

A fundamental property of DAA is that submitting the True Preference List (TPL) is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Seekers) to secure the best possible stable match. 

1. Initial DAA Calculation (Assuming all submit TPLs):
Seeker_E's TPL is [C_C, C_B, C_A, C_D, C_E].
- C_C (Rank 1): Seeker_E is 4th priority (Q_C). S_D (3rd priority) also applies and is preferred over S_E. C_C goes to S_D.
- C_B (Rank 2): Seeker_E is 5th (last) priority (Q_B). S_B (3rd priority) applies and is preferred over S_E. C_B goes to S_B.
- C_A (Rank 3): Seeker_E is 4th priority (Q_A). S_A (3rd priority) applies and is preferred over S_E. C_A goes to S_A.
- C_D (Rank 4): S_E applies in Round 4, displacing S_C because S_E is 2nd priority (Q_D) and S_C is 3rd. S_E matches with C_D.

The resulting stable match M is M = {(S_A, C_A), (S_B, C_B), (S_D, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_C, C_E)}. Seeker_E achieves a match with Company_D (Rank 4).

Since the final match M is stable and every temporary admission that caused a rejection (S_D at C_C, S_B at C_B, S_A at C_A, S_E at C_D) was also the seeker's final match, no blocking seekers are found. The process terminates immediately after Part 1.

3. Strategic Consideration:

This resulted in C matching with Company C (4th choice) in the resulting stable matching (M'). I also verified if submitting the TPL could yield a better outcome if the other agents used their R6 restricted lists; this scenario consistently forced C back toward the restricted list, stabilizing the outcome at Company B (3rd choice).

1. Analysis using True Preferences (L1 = [C_C, C_A, C_B, C_E, C_D]): When all seekers submit their true lists, the initial execution of Part 1 (DA algorithm) results in Seeker D being temporarily admitted by C_C in Round 1, but later rejected by Seeker C (who has higher priority at C_C). Seeker D eventually stabilizes at C_A (Rank 2).
2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2): Because Seeker D's temporary admission at C_C in Round 1 caused Seeker E to be rejected, and Seeker D ultimately matched with C_A, Seeker D is identified as a blocking Job Seeker at C_C. The rule dictates that C_C is removed from Seeker D's list.
3. Rerun: The procedure reruns with Seeker D's modified list [C_A, C_B, C_E, C_D]. This rerun yields a final, stable match for Seeker D with C_A (Rank 2).
4. Strategic Consideration: Since Seeker C has the highest priority at C_C, Seeker D cannot secure C_C regardless of the submission strategy, as C_C will eventually reject D for C. Furthermore, any attempt by D to propose C_C first will trigger the Part 2 penalty because D's proposal rejects Seeker E (D is 3rd priority, E is 4th priority), forcing C_C off the list. 
5. Conclusion: The best achievable outcome is C_A (Rank 2). Submitting the True Preference List [C_C, C_A, C_B, C_E, C_D] leads directly to this outcome after the Part 2 correction.

I analyzed the stable matching (M) resulting from all seekers submitting their true preferences (P_True). The outcome of M is: (A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D). Seeker A is matched with Company E (5th choice).

I then tested manipulative strategies for Seeker A (e.g., proposing B or D first) to see if a better outcome (A, C, D, or B) could be achieved. In all cases, the stable matching M remained the same, demonstrating the robust nature of the SPDA outcome set.

Furthermore, the complex Part 2 rule regarding 'blocking Job Seekers' penalizes seekers whose temporary admissions (often necessary for manipulation) differ from their final match. My simulation of a beneficial manipulation (A submitting B first, achieving a temporary match with B) showed that subsequent iterative reruns triggered by blocking seekers ultimately reverted A's match back to E, confirming that the mechanism successfully discourages beneficial manipulation.

However, the 'Matching Environment' includes Part 2, an iterative process that removes companies from a seeker's Choice Ranking List if the seeker was a 'blocking Job Seeker' there (i.e., temporarily admitted but eventually moved, causing others to be rejected).

1. Analysis of True Preference Submission: Submitting [B, D, A, E, C] results in M (B matched with D, 2nd choice). However, Seeker B is identified as a blocking seeker at Company B and Company A, because B caused rejections at both before securing D. This triggers iterative preference removal, eventually leading to a final outcome of Company E (4th choice).

2. Strategic Goal: To secure a high rank (ideally D, 2nd choice) while preventing Part 2 iteration, I must submit a list where the resulting stable match M* does not feature me as a blocking seeker.

3. Testing non-blocking lists: Since Company D (my 2nd choice) rejects me in Round 1 if I apply there (due to higher priority competition from C), I cannot secure D without applying to other companies first, which risks becoming a blocker.

1. Initial Run (Assuming S_D submits True Preferences: [C_C, C_A, C_B, C_E, C_D], and others submit true preferences):

2. Part 2 Analysis:
   S_D was identified as a blocking seeker at C_C (R1 admission, R7 rejection) and C_A (R8 admission, R13 rejection), because S_D moved to C_B. The system removed C_C from S_D's list for the next rerun.

2. Strategic Analysis: To achieve a better match (Rank 4 or higher), I must strategically misrepresent my list to avoid being identified as a blocker at my higher ranked choices (A and B).

3. Attempt to avoid A waiver: The most damaging waiver was the removal of A (Rank 1) from my list after Rerun 1.

In DA, submitting truthful preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing side (job seekers) to secure the best possible stable outcome. 

1. Simulation of Truthful Submission (TPL: C_D > C_A > C_B > C_C > C_E):
   - R1: S_C applies to C_D, is temporarily admitted.
   - R4: S_E applies to C_D. C_D prefers S_E (P2) over S_C (P3). S_C is rejected.
   - R5/R6: S_C applies to C_A (P5) and C_B (P4), and is rejected by S_A and S_B, respectively.
   - R7: S_C applies to C_C (Rank 4). C_C prefers S_C (P1) over its current match S_D (P3). S_C secures C_C.
   - Final Match: S_C matches with Company_C (Rank 4).

2. Analysis of Potential Improvement:
   - S_C's priority at C_D (P3), C_A (P5), and C_B (P4) is low. Stronger seekers (S_E, S_A, S_B) will always displace S_C or secure these positions earlier. Therefore, securing R1, R2, or R3 is impossible, as confirmed by simulations of strategic lists targeting C_A or C_B first, which still result in S_C being rejected and moving down to C_C.

3. Conclusion:
   The highest ranked company S_C can stably match with is Company_C (Rank 4), where S_C holds the highest priority (P1). Since the truthful strategy yields this optimal stable outcome, there is no benefit in misrepresenting preferences, especially considering the constraints of the market priorities.

Since A, B, and D secure their Rank 1 choices, they are highly stable and unlikely to move, making it impossible for E to displace them via misrepresentation. Any unilateral deviation by E still results in E matching with Company D.

Furthermore, I verified that the resulting match M = {(A, A), (B, B), (D, C), (E, D), (C, E)} contains no 'blocking Job Seekers' (Part 2 check) because every seeker who caused a rejection by temporary admission ended up with that company (TA = FA).

In standard DA, submitting one's true preferences is the dominant strategy for the proposing side (Seekers) to secure the best possible stable match (the Seeker-optimal stable match).

1. Initial Simulation (Part 1, assuming all submit TPLs):
If all seekers submit their TPLs, the standard DA procedure (Part 1) results in matches that are unstable based on true preferences, but the procedure runs to completion. The resulting matching $M_0$ is A:A, B:B, C:C (Rank 4), D:D, E:E.

2. Part 2 Analysis (Blocking Seekers):
The initial run reveals blocking seekers (D at C, E at D). The procedure dictates removing the company from the blocking seeker's list and rerunning Part 1.

2.

2. Blocking Seeker Analysis (Part 2):
The temporary admissions during Part 1 create blocking situations. Specifically, S_D's temporary match at C_C (R1) caused S_E's rejection, and S_D's temporary match at C_A (R8) caused S_A's rejection, while S_D ultimately matched C_B. Similarly, S_A also becomes a blocking seeker.

3. Iterative Waiver Process:
The Part 2 mechanism forces the removal of the blocking companies from the seekers' lists, starting from the latest blocking event. This sequence forces S_A to waive C_B, and subsequently forces S_D to waive C_C.

1.  **Analyze True Preferences (P_A):** Submitting my true preferences ([A, C, D, B, E]) leads to an initial match of A <-> A (Rank 1), but this outcome triggers a complex blocking chain involving Seeker D at Company C and Company A. This chain ultimately stabilizes at the assignment A <-> E (Rank 5), as D is forced to remove its top two choices (C and A) from its list.

1. Simulation of Truthful Submission (C_D = [C, A, B, E, D]): The outcome is a match with Company_E (Rank 4). Seeker_D proposes C first but is displaced by Seeker_C, who has higher priority at Company_C, in a later round.

2. Attempting Manipulation for Rank 1 (C) or Rank 2 (A): 
   a. To get Company_C (Rank 1), Seeker_D must prevent Seeker_C from proposing to C, or displace Seeker_C. Since Seeker_C prefers C over D, and has 1st priority at C, displacing C is impossible if C proposes C. Any list starting with C results in Rank 4 (E).
   b. To get Company_A (Rank 2), D must secure A and prevent Seeker_B (who has 1st priority at A) from proposing there. 

3. Strategic Submission C_D = [A, C, B, E, D] (Proposing Rank 2 first): Simulating the DA procedure with this list results in Seeker_D being matched with Company_B (Rank 3).

If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_A matches Company_A (Rank 1) in Part 1. However, Seeker_D (who prefers Company_C first) is temporarily admitted at Company_C in R1 but ends up at Company_E (4th choice). This makes D a 'blocking Job Seeker' at C. 

2. Impact of Blocking:
Part 2 dictates that Company_C must be removed from D's submitted list, forcing a rerun. In the rerun, D's highest available choice is now Company_A (D is 2nd priority at A, while A is 3rd priority for A). D applies to A in R1 of the rerun, displaces A, and A is eventually pushed down to match Company_E (Rank 5). Thus, truthful submission yields Rank 5.

3. Strategy: Achieving a Part 2 Stable Match:
To achieve a better outcome, I must prevent the initial configuration that causes D to block at C. D blocks at C because D's 1st choice (C) does not match D in the final assignment, even though D was admitted there temporarily. D's true preference is [C, A, B, E, D]. D matches C if C does not reject D later.

Attempts to rank C, D, or B first all lead to the same initial stable match (A->A, D->E, E->D, C->C) which is unstable under Part 2, resulting in A->E in the final stable matching.

If A anticipates that E (Rank 5) is the highest rank achievable in the final stable matching ($M_{final}$), A should submit a list that achieves this stable match immediately, avoiding the complex and detrimental reruns.

This strongly suggests that my final outcome is fixed by the result of the initial Part 1 run based on my submitted list.

Therefore, my optimal strategy is to submit my True Preference List to secure the best stable partner possible. 

Execution of Part 1 (using all true preferences):
1. The JS-DA algorithm proceeds through multiple rounds of applications and rejections.
2. Seeker D (myself) applies to C (R1), is temporarily admitted, but later rejected by C for Seeker C (R5).
3. D subsequently applies to A (R6), is temporarily admitted, but later rejected by A for Seeker B (R11).
4. D eventually applies to B (R12) and is admitted, resulting in a final match (D, B).

The final stable matching (S-OSM) is F = {(A, E), (B, D), (C, C), (D, B), (E, A)}. My outcome is a match with Company B, which is my 3rd choice. Since Company A rejects me for Seeker B (Company A's 1st priority), and Company C rejects me for Seeker C (Company C's 1st priority), I cannot achieve my 1st or 2nd choice in the S-OSM. Submitting the true list maximizes my chance of securing this 3rd choice, Company B, which is the best achievable outcome for me in the stable matching set.",True,Company_A,False,False,2

The complex procedure involves a Seeker-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (Part 1) followed by iterative waivers (Part 2) based on 'blocking seekers'.

1. Sincere Strategy (Submitting TPL: [C, B, A, D, E]): Simulation shows that D has higher priority than E at Company C. E is rejected early, leading to a cascade of temporary admissions and rejections. The iterative waiver process (Part 2) eventually converges to a stable matching M* where Seeker_E is matched with Company_E (Rank 5).

2. Strategic Analysis: Since E has low priority (4th or 5th) at C, B, and A, applying to them first leads to early rejection and triggers the unfavorable waiver cascade. E must secure a high-ranked temporary match that is likely to become permanent.

3. Targeting D (Rank 4): If E applies to Company D first: [D, C, B, A, E].
   In Round 1, D receives applications from C and E. Since E (2nd priority at D) is preferred over C (3rd priority at D), D admits E and rejects C. E secures a temporary match M_temp(E)=D. This match is consistent with E's 4th preferred option.

4. Outcome with [D, C, B, A, E]: Running the full process (Simulation 8 and subsequent waiver analysis) starting with this strategic list results in a final matching where E is matched with D (Rank 4).

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Company_C): Company_C prefers Seeker_C (P1) over Seeker_D (P3). Seeker_C prefers Company_C as their 4th choice, but since Seeker_C is blocked from their top 3 choices (C_D, C_A, C_B) by agents C_D/C_A/C_B prefer more highly, Seeker_C will eventually apply to C_C and secure it, displacing Seeker_D if D was temporarily admitted.

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2):
In M(P), Seeker D was temporarily admitted at Company C (R1), rejecting Seeker E. D's final match is Company E (D's P4). Since D's temporary admission (C) differs from the final admission (E), D is a Blocking Seeker at C.

3. Rerunning the Process (RERUN 1):
Company C is removed from D's list. D's new list starts with A. D proposes to Company A first. Since Company A ranks D (L2) above A (L3), D displaces A from Company A.
Tracing the cascade in RERUN 1 shows that Seeker A is rejected by A, C, and D, eventually matching with Company B (Rank 4).

1. Initial DA Run (M1) using True Preferences (P_B): The resulting stable matching M1 yields a match for Seeker_B with Company_A (3rd choice).
2. Blocking Check (Part 2, Iteration 1): Based on the history of M1, multiple agents are identified as blocking. The last step where blocking occurred was R11, where Seeker_A (S_A) was temporarily admitted to Company_B (C_B), causing Seeker_B (S_B) to be rejected. Since S_A eventually moved to Company_E in M1, S_A is a blocking seeker at C_B. Consequently, C_B is removed from S_A's submitted list (P'_A).
3. Rerun DA (M2) with P'_A: With C_B removed from S_A's options, S_A is unable to propose to C_B. In the subsequent DA run (M2), S_B successfully holds onto C_B from Round 1 onward, achieving a final match of (S_B, C_B). C_B is Seeker_B's 1st choice.
4. Final Match: M2 has no blocking seekers, so the procedure terminates. Seeker_B achieves their Rank 1 choice.

Submitting the True Preference List led to the optimal outcome (C_B, Rank 1) due to the Part 2 mechanism correcting the previous blocking behavior of Seeker_A.

Step 1 (DA run with TPLs):
Seeker_E proposes to C_C (R1, rejected by S_D), C_B (R2, rejected by S_B), C_A (R3, rejected by S_A), and finally matches with C_D (R4), which is rank 4 on the TPL. 

I confirmed that Seeker_E cannot obtain a higher-ranked company (C_C, C_B, or C_A) because those companies are matched with seekers (S_D, S_B, S_A respectively) whom they prioritize higher than Seeker_E, and those seekers rank those companies as their first choice.

I considered a deviation (e.g., proposing to Company A first) and found that it still resulted in a match with Company_C (Rank 4) for Seeker_C, while potentially harming other seekers (e.g., Seeker_B became unmatched in the deviation scenario). 

Furthermore, the complexity introduced by Part 2 (blocking Job Seekers) does not affect Seeker_C's optimal strategy because the rules explicitly state that the automatic waiver resulting from Part 2 will 'never change your final admission.' Therefore, the final admission for Seeker_C is determined solely by the outcome of Part 1 based on the submitted Choice Ranking Lists.

2. Blocking Seeker Mechanism (Part 2): When submitting TPL, my temporary admissions at Company_C (rejecting Seeker_E) and Company_A (rejecting Seeker_A) cause me to be identified as a 'blocking Job Seeker' because I ultimately move to Company_B.

I first calculated the stable matching (M*) assuming all agents submit their true preferences/priorities (Part 1):
1. R1 proposals: A->A, B->B, C->D, D->C, E->C. C holds D (D preferred over E). E rejected.

   Running the Deferred Acceptance (DA) process, including the iterative blocking agent removal (Part 2), shows that Seeker_A eventually matches with Company_E (Rank 5).

2. Analyze Strategic Manipulation (S = ['C', 'A', 'D', 'B', 'E']).
   I test a strategy where I swap my top two choices (A and C). By applying to Company_C (R2) first, I ensure immediate rejection (D and E have higher priority at C(C) than A), allowing me to apply to Company_A (R1) in the second round, slightly later than the truthful strategy.
   This change in timing shifts the rejection sequence involving Seekers B and D, who are highly preferred by Company_A and Company_B. When running the DA process with this strategic list (and subsequent Part 2 waivers triggered by blocking agents D and B), the final matching is calculated as M = {A: B, B: E, C: D, D: A, E: C}.

1. I first calculated the COSM based on all agents submitting their True Preferences (P_True). The resulting unique stable matching (M_COSM) is: (S_B, C_A), (S_D, C_B), (S_C, C_C), (S_E, C_D), (S_A, C_E).

When the stable matching is unique, strategic manipulation (by reordering preferences) is ineffective, as the final outcome is fixed. Furthermore, manipulating by omitting a preferred company (e.g., C_B or C_D) risks forcing me to a lower-ranked company (C_E) or unemployment, as shown in test simulations.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to submit my complete True Preference List, maximizing my chances of securing a better company should the stable matching shift, while guaranteeing I secure the best position (E) that the market allows for me.",True,Company_E,False,False,5

1. Analysis of C_C (P1): Company_C ranks S_C (Q1) and S_B (Q2) higher than me (S_D, Q3). Since S_C's sincere path leads them to propose to C_C (P4) after being rejected from their top three choices, S_C will always displace me if I hold C_C temporarily (as seen in R7 of the sincere run, or R13 of the insincere run). Therefore, C_C is likely unattainable unless I can drastically change S_C's path, which is difficult without knowing if S_C or others will also strategize.

2. Sincere Submission Outcome: If all seekers submit sincerely, the Part 1 outcome is (S_D, C_B) [P3]. However, the iterative Part 2 mechanism forces preference list changes (S_A removes C_B, then S_D removes C_C) until a stable state (M_R2) is reached. This final stable match is (S_D, C_A) [P2].
