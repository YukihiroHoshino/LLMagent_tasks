I have a quota of 1. I previously rejected Seeker_C in Round 5, indicating a preference to hold out for higher-ranked candidates. Since my top 3 priorities (D, A, B) are still unmatched, and only 7 rounds have passed, accepting Rank 4 now sacrifices the chance to match with higher priorities. Seeker_C is also my lowest preference (Rank 5) on their list, suggesting they are desperate. I will maintain the strategy of holding out for a higher-ranked match by rejecting Seeker_C again, despite their renewed application, to maximize my priority rank outcome."

Seeker_C is now using a [TALK] tag to strongly reiterate their commitment and readiness to accept an offer, essentially pressuring for a decision. Since the tag is [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. I need to maintain Seeker_C's interest as a backup option while avoiding extending an offer or encouraging a third application that I would likely reject.

Seeker_C has applied twice previously (R5, R7) and used R8 to reiterate commitment ([TALK]). Since Company_B has not yet accepted, they are likely holding out for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D, A, B). If those seekers are matched, Seeker_C (rank 4 for B) is a strong contender compared to Seeker_E (rank 5 for B). Given the critical market situation (B being the last option) and the need to secure a match, I must apply again to demonstrate maximum urgency and commitment, forcing Company_B to make a decision based on their remaining options."
