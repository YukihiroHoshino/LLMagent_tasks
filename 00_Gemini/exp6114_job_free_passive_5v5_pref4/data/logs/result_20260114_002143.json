The competition for Seeker_D is fierce, and my chances of securing them are low. Given the certainty of securing a preferred candidate (Seeker_B) who is enthusiastic about the role, accepting this application is the prudent choice to fulfill my quota effectively, rather than risking ending up with only my last choice (Seeker_C) or no match."
