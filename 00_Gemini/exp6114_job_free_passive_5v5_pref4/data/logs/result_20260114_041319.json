This is a mission-critical role offering substantial strategic influence and visibility across the organization. Are there any specific metrics of success for this project you'd like to discuss?",

Seeker_C used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK].

However, Seeker_C is the only remaining candidate in Round 29, meaning securing this match is critical to avoid failing to meet my quota entirely. Matching with Rank 5 is vastly superior to failing to hire (Rank 0). The Job Seeker used the [TALK] tag, so I must respond with [TALK]. My strategy for many rounds has been to confirm my readiness to hire (since I have no other options) but require Seeker_C to formalize their commitment by using the [APPLY] tag, which triggers the [ACCEPT]/[REJECT] mechanism. I must repeat this strategy one last time, making it clear that the match is guaranteed immediately upon their formal application, as failure to do so risks the simulation ending before the match is established."
