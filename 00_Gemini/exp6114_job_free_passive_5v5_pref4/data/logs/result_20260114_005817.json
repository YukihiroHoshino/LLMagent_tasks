We are truly honored that Company_D remains your primary and highest preference, and we deeply value your commitment to accepting an offer immediately. Your dedication is noted and highly impressive. However, based on our ongoing internal prioritization and the current stage of our recruitment cycle, we are still not in a position to extend a final offer at this exact moment. We appreciate your persistence and strong interest.",

Accepting Seeker_A would fill my single quota and prevent me from securing Seeker_B. Although Seeker_A is applying aggressively and ranks Company_D as #1, I must prioritize my preferred candidate, Seeker_B. I will reject Seeker_A again to keep my quota open."

The market is highly saturated (Round 8), and only Company_D and Company_E remain unmatched. I have applied aggressively to Company_D (Rank 1), but they rank me last (5/5), making a match highly improbable. Company_E, however, ranks me first (1/5). Since I have only used [TALK] once with Company_E and have not formally applied, and given that Company_E is my best remaining chance for a favorable match, I must apply now to secure the position. This is a critical move to ensure employment given the advanced stage of the simulation."
