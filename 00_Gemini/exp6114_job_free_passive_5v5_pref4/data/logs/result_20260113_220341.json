This implies that all other seekers (Seeker_A, B, C, D) have matched with Companies A, C, D, E, leaving only Seeker_E and Company_B available. Although Company_B ranked me last (5th), given that their top four candidates are now matched elsewhere, I am their only viable option, and they are my only viable option to avoid unemployment.
