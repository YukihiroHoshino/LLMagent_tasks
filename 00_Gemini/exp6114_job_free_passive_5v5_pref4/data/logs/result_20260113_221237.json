I have previously applied to Company_E, and since they are still unmatched, that application was likely rejected or put on hold due to my low priority (5th/5) on their list. However, as the market progresses, Company_E might be lowering its standards or realizing its preferred candidates are gone. I must secure a match now. I will re-apply ([APPLY]) to signal unwavering commitment and urgency, hoping they accept me now that other options may have disappeared."
