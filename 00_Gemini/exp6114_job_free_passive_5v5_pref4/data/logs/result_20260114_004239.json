Given this strong mutual interest and the fact that I have already initiated a conversation ([TALK]) in a previous round, securing this match now is a prudent move. While Company_D (my #1 choice) is still available, Company_C represents a high-ranking safety match. I will proceed with a formal application to lock in this favorable position."
