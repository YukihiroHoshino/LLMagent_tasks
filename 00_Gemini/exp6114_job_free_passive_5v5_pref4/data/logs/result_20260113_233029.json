Company_A ranks me (Seeker_C) as their 2nd priority, which is a very favorable position. Given that my priority ranking is very low (P4 or P5) for my top 3 choices (D, C, E), securing a match with Company_A (my P4) early in Round 1, where I am highly desirable (P2), is a pragmatic move to ensure I don't end up with my lowest choice (B) or unmatched. I will apply now to capitalize on this high priority."

The current target, Seeker_C, is my second highest priority candidate. Since it is Round 1 and Seeker_C has already submitted a formal application, securing this high-priority match immediately is strategically sound, even though Seeker_E is ranked slightly higher. Accepting Seeker_C fulfills my quota with a top-tier candidate."

Since there is a strong mutual interest (Seeker_D is highly ranked by Company_C, and Company_C is ranked moderately high by Seeker_D), securing this match immediately is highly beneficial, as it guarantees a match and prevents other highly desired companies (D and B) from being taken by other seekers if I wait too long.
