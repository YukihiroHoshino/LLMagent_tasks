The market status indicates that only Company_A, Company_B, and Company_E remain unmatched, suggesting Company_D (my Rank 1) is gone.\nAmong remaining options, Company_B is my 2nd choice (after Company_A). Crucially, I must consider Company_B's priorities. Company_B ranks me 2nd overall (['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', ...]). If Seeker_D matched with Company_D (which is highly likely as D was Rank 1 for both), then I become Company_B's effective top priority.\nSince I am highly ranked by Company_B and they are a high preference for me, securing this match now is crucial, especially as Company_A has not yet accepted my previous application. I will formally apply to Company_B."
