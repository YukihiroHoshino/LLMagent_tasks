Having followed your recent successes, I am confident that my background and skill set align well with your team’s strategic objectives.

The market is nearing conclusion, with only Company_A and Company_E remaining unmatched. I have heavily pursued Company_E (my 3rd choice), but Company_E ranks me last (5th). Conversely, Company_A ranks me 2nd ('Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', ...). Given the high probability of acceptance from Company_A, and the extremely low probability of acceptance from my higher-ranked remaining option (Company_E), it is rational to secure the match with Company_A now. I have not applied to Company_A previously, so I will formally apply."
