Based on the fact that Company E is still unmatched, its higher priority candidates (Seeker A, D, E) must be matched elsewhere, making Seeker B (Rank 4) its highest remaining priority candidate. I have an application standing and have reiterated commitment over 27 previous rounds. The strategy remains to emphasize the mutual catastrophic failure if they do not match now, guaranteeing immediate acceptance to secure their quota. I must use [TALK] to prompt their final decision on the standing application."
