All other companies and seekers are presumably matched, leaving Company_E and Seeker_B as the final pair needing to secure a match. I have applied previously and sent numerous follow-up [TALK] messages emphasizing my unwavering P1 commitment. Since this is the final opportunity, I must deliver an ultimate, definitive appeal, stressing the instantaneous nature of my acceptance and the shared necessity of concluding the market. I will use [TALK] as I have already formally applied."

Seeker_B continues to use [TALK] despite repeated explicit requests for [APPLY] to formalize the agreement.

I must make the final pitch, confirming the acceptance is ready, but stressing the procedural necessity of the [APPLY] tag in this absolute final moment to secure the match before the market closes in Round 30."
