Company_A ranks me #3, meaning I have a decent chance if Seeker_E (#1) and Seeker_C (#2) are matched elsewhere. However, Company_C (Rank 3) is a better match for me, and I am Company_C's #1 priority. Therefore, I should prioritize reserving my formal application for Company_C while keeping Company_A interested.
