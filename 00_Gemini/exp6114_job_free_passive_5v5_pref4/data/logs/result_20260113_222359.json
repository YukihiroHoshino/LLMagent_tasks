However, Company_A's top four preferences (Seeker_E, C, D, A) are all likely aiming for Company_D in this initial round, as Company_D is their Rank 1 choice. This creates a small window of opportunity.\nGiven the high desirability of Company_A for me, I must be proactive and use [APPLY] immediately to test the market and secure the position if the higher-ranked candidates apply elsewhere."

Crucially, Seeker_D and Seeker_E both list Company_D as their top preference, making them strong potential matches in future rounds.
