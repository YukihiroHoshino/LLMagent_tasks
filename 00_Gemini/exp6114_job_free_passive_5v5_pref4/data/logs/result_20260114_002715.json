Since my 2nd priority (Seeker_A) is still unmatched and ranks me 3rd, I should continue holding out for A if possible, or B. Seeker_C ranks me last (5th), so accepting them now would secure a match, but it locks me out of potentially better matches.

However, since we are in Round 8 and Company_A is still unmatched, it is highly probable that its top candidates have matched elsewhere or are still pursuing their own top choices. Company_A's priority for me is P4. Given the narrowing market and my strong desire for this match, I must continue to press hard with an [APPLY] action. Switching to [TALK] would be detrimental at this stage, as it signals wavering commitment when I need to demonstrate absolute certainty to secure the match if its preferred candidates are gone."

Seeker_A is the target for this round and is ranked 4th. Crucially, Seeker_C (Rank 2) is still unmatched and available. Since I have only one quota, accepting Seeker_A would prevent me from potentially matching with the much higher priority Seeker_C later. Given that Seeker_A has been rejected four times already, maintaining the rejection stance is necessary to hold out for Seeker_C, whose top choices (D, C, E) are likely matched or rejected them, increasing the likelihood Seeker_C will apply to Company_A (their 4th preference) soon. I must reject Seeker_A again to keep my quota open."
