I have applied twice and expressed strong interest once already, but the market has changed significantly since then (only C and E remain). Given that Company_E's top priority candidates (S_A, S_D, S_E) are likely matched elsewhere, my ranking (#4) is now highly competitive against the only other remaining seeker (likely S_C, ranked #5 by C_E). I must apply again immediately to secure this top choice before C_E potentially matches with S_C or holds out further. The risk of being rejected is low compared to the reward of securing my #1 match."

Company_C has rejected me five times previously, as I am their lowest preference (5th).
