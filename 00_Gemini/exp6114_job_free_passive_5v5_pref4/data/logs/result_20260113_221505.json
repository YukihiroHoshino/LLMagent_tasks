Since Company_D (P1) is not listed among the unmatched companies, I must assume Company_C is now my highest available priority. My previous interaction with Company_C was a strong appeal using [TALK]. However, Company_C ranks me last (5th) on their priority list, meaning they highly prefer Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A, and Seeker_B over me. If I wait, Company_C is likely to match with a higher-ranked seeker soon. To secure this highly desired match before it's too late, I must move beyond talking and formally apply immediately, forcing them to make a decision based on their available quota and current offers. This is a high-stakes move necessary to lock in my highest remaining preference."

The target, Seeker_C, is my lowest priority.

Crucially, Company_A ranks me highly (2nd priority: ['Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', ...]). Since securing a match is vital, and Company_A is likely to accept me due to their high prioritization, I should apply immediately to secure my second-best available option (Rank 4 overall), especially while waiting for the outcome of my application to Company_C.
