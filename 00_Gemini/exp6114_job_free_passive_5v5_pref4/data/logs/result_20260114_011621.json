An entry-level developer proposed a complete overhaul of our legacy data processing pipeline, arguing that adopting a specific open-source framework would cut processing time by 40% and reduce operational costs significantly. Instead of dismissing it, we immediately formed a dedicated task force led by that developer, providing them with the necessary resources and mentorship. The implementation was a massive success, and that employee is now leading a core architecture team.
