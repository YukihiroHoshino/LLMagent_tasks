However, Seeker_B has applied directly and stated I am their top choice, guaranteeing a match. Furthermore, Seeker_B is the top priority for Company_D, a major competitor. Given that my top 3 targets (A, D, E) are highly competitive and likely to match elsewhere (especially D and A, who rank me low), securing a guaranteed match with a high-value candidate (who is highly desired by competitors) in Round 1 is a strong strategic move, even if they are 4th on my list. This prevents a competitor (Company_D) from immediately securing their top choice."

Crucially, Seeker_E has stated that Company_D is their top choice and has sent an official [APPLY]. While Seeker_B (Rank 1) and Seeker_D (Rank 2) are higher, Seeker_D is highly desired by multiple other companies (B and C rank D as 1st), and Seeker_B ranks D low (4th).
