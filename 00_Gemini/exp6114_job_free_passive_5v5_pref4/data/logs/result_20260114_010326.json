My top preference is Company_D, but since I am paired with Company_A in Round 1, I must decide whether to apply immediately. Company_A ranks me 4th (R4). However, analyzing Company_A's top three preferences (Seeker_E, Seeker_C, Seeker_D) reveals they rank Company_A quite low (P5, P4, P4 respectively). Since I rank Company_A P2, I am the most enthusiastic candidate among their top four choices. Given the limited capacity (1) and the sequential nature of negotiations, applying now is a strong strategic move to secure a high-preference match before Company_A potentially matches with a higher-ranked but less interested seeker, or before my P1 option becomes unavailable. Securing P2 early is a great outcome."

Since Seeker_A has formally applied and I have an immediate quota to fill, accepting this highly ranked candidate is a very strong strategic move, securing a near-optimal match early in the process.
