Since I have a guaranteed acceptance here in Round 1, securing this match (4th preference) is a highly stable and rational move, preventing me from potentially settling for my 5th choice (Company_C) or remaining unmatched later, especially since my chances with my top 3 choices (E, A, B) are mixed to poor based on their priority lists.
