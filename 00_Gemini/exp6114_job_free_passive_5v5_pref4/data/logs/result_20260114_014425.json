Regarding professional development, we have a structured mentorship program pairing new hires with senior leadership, dedicated internal R&D time for skill diversification, and a substantial annual budget for external training and certifications, ensuring your trajectory aligns perfectly with your goals. What specific technical or leadership skills are you hoping to develop next?",
