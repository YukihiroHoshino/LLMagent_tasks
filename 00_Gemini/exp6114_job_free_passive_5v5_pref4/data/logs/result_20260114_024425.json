Currently, our team is focused on developing and implementing advanced solutions for strategic market forecasting and scalable system architecture optimization. We are looking for a leader in this area whose skills align with high-impact, immediate needs. Your background in complex modeling and strategic implementation fits perfectly with our priority requirements for this crucial role. We strongly encourage you to formalize your interest.",

Seeker_C initiated with [TALK], inquiring about specific roles, indicating they are assessing fit before committing. Since Company_A is only Rank 4 on Seeker_C's preference list, I need to provide a compelling answer that signals strong mutual interest and specific alignment to encourage them to [APPLY] next round. I must reply with [TALK]."

Given that Company_C is still an acceptable match, withdrawing now might be premature, especially since I am only ranked 3rd on their priority list, meaning they might be waiting for Seeker_D or Seeker_E. I need to keep this option open while waiting for potential matches with higher-ranked companies (like Company_A, Rank 2).

I need to keep the conversation alive to maintain P3 as a viable backup option, without accepting prematurely.
