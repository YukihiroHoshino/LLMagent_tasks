Regarding the final decision timeline: once a formal application is submitted, we aim to move very quickly. Typically, we conclude the final interview stage and issue an offer within 48 to 72 hours. We prioritize candidates like yourself who demonstrate such clear potential and alignment with our strategic vision. We are excited about the prospect of you joining Company_E.",

I need to provide the requested information (timeline) clearly and maintain a highly enthusiastic tone to appeal to them, especially since I am their 4th preference. Securing Seeker_A is the optimal outcome for Company_E."

However, examining Company_A's priorities, I am ranked 2nd ('Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', ...). This is an extremely favorable position for me. My attempts to secure my P1 (Company_D) have failed twice. Furthermore, my rank at my P2 (C) and P3 (E) companies is P5 (lowest). Therefore, Company_A represents my highest realistic chance of getting accepted. Given that we are in Round 3 and I need to secure a match before better opportunities vanish for others, I must capitalize on this high priority ranking at Company_A, even though they are P4 for me. I will submit a formal application."

Seeker_C's application ([APPLY]) indicates a willingness to commit now.
