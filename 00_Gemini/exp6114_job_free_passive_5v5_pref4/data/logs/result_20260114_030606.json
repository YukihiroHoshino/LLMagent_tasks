Since my quota is 1, and all higher priorities are presumably matched, securing Seeker_B is the optimal outcome to fill my quota. Seeker_B is using the [TALK] tag, demanding an immediate acceptance without applying again, likely due to a prior rejection. I have been telling Seeker_B for multiple rounds that I am ready to accept, provided they use [APPLY]. Since Seeker_B used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I need to maintain the stance that the match is ready and confirmed, but the procedural step ([APPLY]) must come from the seeker to finalize the agreement, especially since this is the final stage of the market. I will use definitive language to encourage them to apply this round."
