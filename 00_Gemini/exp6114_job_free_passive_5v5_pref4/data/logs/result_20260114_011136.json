My priority rankings at my top 3 choices (D: 4th, C: 5th, E: 5th) are poor, making acceptance highly unlikely there. Since Company_A offers a very high probability of immediate acceptance (2nd priority) and is still on my preference list, securing this position early in Round 1 is a strong strategic move to guarantee a match, preventing me from risking unemployment or being forced to take my 5th choice (Company_B) later.
