While Company_C is low on my list, securing a match is important, especially since my priority ranking is low (Rank 4/5) at my higher-preferred companies (A, E) and moderate at B. Company_C ranks me 4th. If the higher-ranked seekers (D, E, A) are not applying to C this round, I might secure the position.

This makes Seeker_A (Rank 3) my highest available priority, followed by Seeker_B (Rank 4). Seeker_B has formally submitted an [APPLY].

Rejecting Seeker_B risks ending the simulation unmatched if Seeker_A matches elsewhere before interacting with me again.
