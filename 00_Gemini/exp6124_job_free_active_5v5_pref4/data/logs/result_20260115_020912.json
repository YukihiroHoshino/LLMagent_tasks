I have been rejected twice by Company_C already. Given that all four companies I prefer more (A, B, D, E) are matched, Company_C is my only remaining option before remaining unemployed. Since Company_C is still unmatched, it means their top choices (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) must have matched elsewhere. I am Company_C's 4th ranked seeker. At this stage of the market, they should be willing to accept me to secure a match, especially if I am the highest available seeker left applying to them. I must make a final, firm application."
