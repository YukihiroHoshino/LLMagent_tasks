However, as the market reaches its final stages in Round 5, I am the only remaining candidate on my preference list, and you are the only available company. My commitment to you, my absolute top choice, is unwavering. Given that your capacity remains unfilled, I am confident that I now represent the strongest available candidate pool for your single position. I am formally applying one last time, ready to accept immediately.",
              "thought": "I am Seeker_B. My preference list is ['Company_E', 'Company_A', 'Company_B', 'Company_D', 'Company_C']. Currently, the only unmatched company is Company_E, which is my number one preference (P1). Companies A, B, C, and D are all matched, meaning my P2, P3, P4, and P5 options are gone. I have applied to Company_E twice before and was rejected, likely because they were holding out for higher priority candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_D, Seeker_E). Since we are in Round 5 and Company_E is still unmatched, it is highly probable that their top three candidates are now matched elsewhere, making me (Seeker_B, ranked 4th by Company_E) the highest priority seeker still available to them. I must apply aggressively now, as unemployment is the only alternative to matching with Company_E."

              "thought": "It is Round 5, and I, Company_E, still have an unfilled quota of 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C']. Seeker_B is my P4 candidate. I have rejected Seeker_B twice before, hoping for a higher-ranked match. However, my top three candidates (A, D, E) were highly desirable to other companies (A, D, C, B) and placed Company_E low on their preference lists, making it highly likely they are already matched. Seeker_B's message strongly implies that the market is closing and they are the best available option, reaffirming their commitment (E is P1 for them). Given the late stage of the simulation (Round 5), securing a P4 match is a strong outcome compared to risking an unfilled quota. I will accept Seeker_B."
