My quota is 1.\nSeeker_B (Rank 3) and Seeker_C (Rank 4) have applied this round. I have rejected both previously.\nIf I accept Seeker_B, I secure a Rank 3 match.

Seeker_A is likely to be rejected by their higher preferences (Company_D and Company_A rank them low) and apply to me soon. Seeker_D might also become available if rejected by Company_D.\nSince I have rejected Seeker_B twice already, maintaining the rejection for a high-priority candidate (Rank 1 or 2) is consistent with my goal of maximizing rank, despite the risk of ending up unmatched or forced to take Rank 4 or 5 later. I will prioritize holding out for Seeker_D or Seeker_A."
