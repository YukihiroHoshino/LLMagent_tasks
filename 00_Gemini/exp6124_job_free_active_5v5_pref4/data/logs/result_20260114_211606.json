Company_A (Rank 2): I have applied twice and been rejected twice. I am the lowest priority (5/5) for Company_A. Further application is highly likely to result in rejection unless all higher priority candidates have matched elsewhere.\n2. Company_C (Rank 5): This is my lowest preference company, but it is still on my list. I have had no prior interaction. I am 4th out of 5 on Company_C's priority list, which gives me a slightly better relative chance than with Company_A, especially since the market is advanced (Round 4).\n\nSince securing a match is the priority over repeated futile attempts, I will pivot to Company_C and formally apply to secure the position while it is still available."
