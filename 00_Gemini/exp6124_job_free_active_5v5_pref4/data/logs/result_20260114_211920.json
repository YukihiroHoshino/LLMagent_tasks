Seeker_B, the current applicant, is my 4th priority. Seeker_B has indicated that Company_C is their last resort (Rank 5 preference). While Seeker_B is low priority, accepting them guarantees a match. My higher priorities (D and E) are highly desired by other companies (D, A, E, B) and rank Company_C only 3rd. Seeker_A ranks me 5th. Given that we are in Round 4 and Seeker_B has already exhausted their top 4 preferences, the market is stabilizing rapidly. The risk of holding out for D, E, or A, who are likely to match elsewhere, is higher than the benefit of potentially securing a slightly better candidate. Since Seeker_B is ranked higher than Seeker_C (whom I rejected earlier), securing this Rank 4 match is a reasonable strategic choice to fulfill the quota and avoid going unmatched."
