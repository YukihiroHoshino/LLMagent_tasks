While waiting for P1 is tempting, securing P2 when the quota is 1 is strategically sound, especially since Seeker_D's primary preference is Company_D, and they might match there or elsewhere before considering Company_B.\nAccepting Seeker_A guarantees a high-quality match (P2) and fulfills my quota.

Seeker_D is likely to be matched by Company_D (P2 for D) or Company_B (P1 for D), but Seeker_A (P1 for E) and Seeker_E (P3 for E) remain viable targets, especially since Seeker_A's preferences are spread out and Seeker_E views me as their P2.
