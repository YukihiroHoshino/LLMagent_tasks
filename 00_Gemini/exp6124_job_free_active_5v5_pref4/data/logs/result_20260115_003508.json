While your commitment is commendable, we have not yet concluded our evaluation process regarding that precise strategic fit.

Given that my top three candidates (D, E, A) are significantly higher priority, and we are still early in the matching process, I should continue holding out for them. Seeker_B is also applying to me (their last choice) out of apparent desperation, which confirms that higher-ranked companies (E, A, B, D) are likely engaged with other seekers.
