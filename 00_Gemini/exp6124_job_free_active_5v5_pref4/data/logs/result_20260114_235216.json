Rejecting Seeker_B now is also strategically beneficial, as Seeker_B is Rank 1 for Company_D. If Seeker_B matches with Company_D, it removes a competitor for my Rank 1 candidate (Seeker_D) at their preferred company (Company_D), increasing the likelihood that Seeker_D will apply to Company_B next."

I have applied twice before and was rejected both times with generic responses about ongoing evaluation. Since time is passing (Round 5), and my top two choices (E and A) are presumably matched, Company_B is now the most critical target. I must show extreme persistence and confidence. By making this the 'third and final' application, I am pressing them for a decision, acknowledging their priority list might be thinning out, and reiterating my readiness to accept immediately. Company_B ranks me 3rd, so if Seeker_D and Seeker_A are matched elsewhere (which is likely given the high number of rounds and rejections from my top choices), I should be accepted."

We are not yet ready to extend an offer at this time, but we encourage you to remain available.",
              "thought": "Company_B's goal is to maximize the rank of the matched job seeker. My priority list is ['Seeker_D' (Rank 1), 'Seeker_A' (Rank 2), 'Seeker_B' (Rank 3)]. Seeker_B is applying for the third time, indicating high commitment, and is likely rejected by their higher preferences (C_E, C_A). If I reject Seeker_B, they will likely turn to Company_D (their 4th preference, but C_D's #1 priority). If Seeker_B matches with Company_D, Company_D is taken off the market. This is advantageous because my top candidate, Seeker_D, ranks Company_D first and Company_B second. If Company_D matches with Seeker_B, Seeker_D will be forced to apply to Company_B (me) next, allowing me to secure my Rank 1 candidate. Therefore, rejecting Seeker_B now is the best strategic move to maximize my outcome."

Seeker_B is now submitting their fourth application, demonstrating extremely strong commitment and noting that I am their highest remaining preference. If I reject them again, they are highly likely to move to their next preference, Company_D, where they are Company_D's P1 priority. If Seeker_B matches with Company_D, I lose my P3 match, and while my P1 (Seeker_D) might become available, the risk of losing this confirmed P3 candidate is too high in Round 6, especially since P1 and P2 have not shown interest yet. Securing a P3 match is a favorable outcome and minimizes the risk of failing to match or matching with P4/P5 later. I must accept Seeker_B now."
