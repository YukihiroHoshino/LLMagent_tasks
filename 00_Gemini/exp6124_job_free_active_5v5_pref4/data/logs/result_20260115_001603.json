We truly appreciate your dedication and formal re-application. However, as we finalize our selection process, we must remain strictly focused on securing a profile that meets a very specific, immediate strategic requirement.

I have already rejected Seeker_C (Rank 5) and Seeker_B (Rank 4) once. Since we are only in Round 4, there is still a reasonable chance that higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) may become available or shift their attention to Company_C, especially as negotiations conclude with their higher preferences (e.g., Company_D, Company_A, Company_B, Company_E). Seeker_B's re-application shows high commitment, likely because they have been rejected by all their preferred companies (E, A, B, D). While Seeker_B is a viable option, my primary objective is to maximize priority rank. I will reject Seeker_B again to hold out for my top 3 candidates (D, E, A). If the market tightens further, Seeker_B might still be available in later rounds given their demonstrated commitment."

Seeker_B is my 4th priority. I have previously rejected Seeker_B three times, hoping to secure a higher-ranked candidate (D, E, or A). It is Round 5, and Seeker_B's message strongly suggests the highly competitive job market is closing, implying that top candidates (D, E, A) are likely matched elsewhere, given their high preference for other companies (A, B, D, E) and high priority status among those companies. Since I have not received applications from D, E, or A, and Seeker_B is demonstrating extreme commitment and availability as the highest currently applying candidate, the risk of remaining unmatched (Rank 6) outweighs the benefit of waiting for a candidate who is increasingly unlikely to be available or interested. Accepting Seeker_B (Rank 4) secures a match before the quota is lost."
