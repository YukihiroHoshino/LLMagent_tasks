This suggests that Company_E's higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_D, Seeker_E) are highly likely to apply to Company_D in the first round.\n\nBy applying immediately to my Rank 1 choice, Company_E, I maximize the chance of securing a match quickly, potentially before Company_E receives applications from its higher-priority candidates who fail to match with Company_D in subsequent rounds.
