Although Company_B previously rejected my application, they are still unmatched, suggesting their top choices (Seeker_D, Seeker_A) may be unavailable or matched elsewhere. This presents an opportunity to re-apply. I will use the [APPLY] action to show renewed commitment and force a decision, hoping that my status as their 3rd preferred seeker (Company_B Priority: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', ...]) now makes me acceptable as their options narrow."
