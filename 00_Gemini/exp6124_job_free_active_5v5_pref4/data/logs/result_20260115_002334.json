Company_C is my lowest preference (#5), and I have already been rejected by them once.\nSince Company_C is the only active company on my list, I must secure a match here to avoid unemployment. Company_C previously rejected me (Seeker_B, ranked #4 on their list). Since they are still unmatched, their top three priorities (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) must have matched elsewhere. This means I am now the highest available candidate remaining on their priority list who has previously applied.\nI will re-apply aggressively, emphasizing my dedication and suitability, hoping that their reduced pool of options will lead them to accept me."

I have a quota of 1 remaining.\n\nMy top three candidates (D, E, A) are highly sought after by other companies (D, A, B, E) and rank Company_C low on their preference lists (3rd, 3rd, and 5th, respectively). Given that we are in Round 5, and none of my top three priorities have applied, the probability of securing them is decreasing rapidly as they likely match with their preferred companies.\n\nSeeker_B has demonstrated significant persistence and commitment by reapplying after a previous rejection, indicating they are serious about joining Company_C, despite it being their last preference. Although Seeker_B is my 4th choice, securing a committed candidate now is strategically sound, preventing the risk of missing out entirely or settling for Seeker_C (my lowest priority). I will accept Seeker_B to fulfill my quota with the highest ranked available candidate who is actively pursuing me."
