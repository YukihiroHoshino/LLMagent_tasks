Company_E prioritizes Seeker_A (1st) and Seeker_D (2nd) above me (3rd). Both Seeker_A and Seeker_D have Company_D as their top choice and are expected to apply there.\n\nIf I apply to Company_E, the main competition is Seeker_B (whose 1st choice is E, but who is E's 4th priority). Since I am Company_E's 3rd priority, I rank higher than Seeker_B. If Seeker_A and Seeker_D apply to Company_D, Company_E will likely accept me immediately, securing my Rank 2 position in Round 1.
