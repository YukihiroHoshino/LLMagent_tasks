My priority list is ['Seeker_E' (P1), 'Seeker_C' (P2), 'Seeker_D' (P3), 'Seeker_A' (P4), 'Seeker_B' (P5)]. I have already rejected P4 and P5. Seeker_C (P2) has applied with an [APPLY] tag. Since P1 (Seeker_E) ranks Company_A last (P5 preference), waiting for Seeker_E is highly risky and unlikely to yield a match. Seeker_C is an excellent, high-priority match (P2). Given I have 1 quota remaining, accepting Seeker_C maximizes my objective function by securing my second-highest priority candidate immediately."
