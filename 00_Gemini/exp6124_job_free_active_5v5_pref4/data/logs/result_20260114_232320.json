In this round, I received applications from Seeker_C (R5) and Seeker_A (R1). Since Seeker_A is my highest priority candidate and has applied, I must prioritize accepting them.

Since securing a match is paramount, and Company_E offers a near-certain acceptance at my 4th preferred option, I choose to apply to Company_E now to finalize a stable outcome. This strategy prioritizes securing a high-certainty match over risking another rejection from Company_A."

Since the company is still unmatched, this is a strong opportunity.\nI must submit a formal [APPLY] immediately to maximize the chance of securing this match, especially before Seeker_E potentially applies to Company_A (though E prefers A only as their 5th choice, they might apply now that their top options are gone, or if they applied previously and were rejected/accepted elsewhere).\nGiven the high ranking Company_A gives me, a decisive application is warranted."
