Accepting Seeker_B now would prevent me from matching with my top three priorities (D, E, A). Since it is only Round 5, and I have not yet received applications from D or E (who rank me 3rd on their preference lists), I must prioritize waiting for them. Seeker_B has applied previously and was rejected, indicating they are likely unsuccessful with their higher preferences (E, A, B, D).
