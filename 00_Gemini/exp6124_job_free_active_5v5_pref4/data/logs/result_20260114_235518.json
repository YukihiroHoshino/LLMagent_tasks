Company_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but it is still on my list. The current situation indicates that Company_C is the only company not yet matched, implying that Company_E, A, B, and D have all matched elsewhere. I have previously applied to and been rejected by Company_C. However, since all my higher preferences are gone, and Company_C is the only available option, I must re-apply. Company_C's top priorities (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) must have matched elsewhere if C is still available. I (Seeker_B) am Company_C's fourth priority. Given that C is unmatched, it is highly likely that its top priorities are unavailable, making me its best available choice. I must use the decisive [APPLY] tag to secure the match."

Since Seeker_B is relatively low on my priority list, and I have not yet secured my top three candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A), I must reject this application to keep my quota open for a higher priority match. Although Seeker_B indicates high commitment, accepting them now would block a potentially better match later in the process. This is the third time Seeker_B has applied, confirming they are likely running out of higher-preferred options, which reinforces my decision to wait."

I have rejected Seeker_B three times previously, hoping for a match with D, E, or A. We are now in Round 5, and Seeker_B is stating that Company_C is the 'sole unmatched opportunity in the market' for them. This strongly suggests that the higher priority candidates (D, E, A) have likely matched with their preferred companies (D, A, B, E). Since my quota is 1, and Seeker_B is an acceptable candidate (ranked above Seeker_C and above an empty slot), continuing to reject them poses a significant risk of ending up with no match at all. Given the persistence and the closing market, securing Seeker_B now is the strategically sound move to guarantee filling the quota with an acceptable candidate."
