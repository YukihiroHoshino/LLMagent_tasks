Accepting Seeker_B (Rank 4) now would lock up my quota and prevent me from matching with a higher priority candidate if they become available in later rounds. Given the high priority of D, E, and A, and the fact that Seeker_B is my lowest preference among the active applicants (Seeker_C was already rejected), the optimal strategy is to continue rejecting Seeker_B to keep the quota open for a better match."
