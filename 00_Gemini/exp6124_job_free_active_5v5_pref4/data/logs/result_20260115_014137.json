Accepting Seeker_B now would prevent me from matching with my top three choices (D, E, A). Since Seeker_B is the only applicant this round, and I have higher ranked candidates still available, I must reject Seeker_B to keep my options open for a higher priority match. This is Seeker_B's second application attempt, which shows strong interest, but my strategic priority is maximizing rank."

I have been rejected by Company_C twice already (Rounds 1 and 2), suggesting they were holding out for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A). Assuming those candidates have now matched elsewhere, Company_C might be ready to accept a lower-ranked candidate like me.
