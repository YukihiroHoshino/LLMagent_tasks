Seeker A and Seeker C also prefer D highly. It is extremely likely I will be rejected by Company D in Round 1 if I apply, as Seeker D (or potentially Seeker B if they apply) will be chosen.\n\n2. Analyze Company E (Rank #2):\nCompany E prioritizes Seeker A (#1), Seeker D (#2), and then me (Seeker E is #3). Seeker A and Seeker D are both expected to apply to Company D (their #1 choice).

Seeker_C has actively applied ([APPLY]).\n\n1. Seeker_E (Priority #1) is highly unlikely to match with Company_A, as we are their last preference (Rank 5) and they are highly desired by other strong competitors (Company_D, Company_C, Company_E).\n2. Seeker_C (Priority #2) applying suggests that their higher preferences (Company_D, Company_C, Company_E) are likely unavailable or have rejected them. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-priority match immediately.\n3. Rejecting Seeker_C in hopes of securing Seeker_E is too risky and likely to result in a worse match overall, or leaving the quota unfilled.\n\nTherefore, I will accept Seeker_C to secure the second-highest priority match."
