Seeker_B claims that Company C is the 'sole remaining company with an open position.' While this claim cannot be definitively verified, the advanced round number (Round 8) and the lack of engagement from my higher priorities (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) suggests that they are likely matched or pursuing higher preferred companies, making their application to Company_C (3rd/5th choice for them) highly unlikely now. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched if I reject Seeker_B again, and Seeker_B's guaranteed commitment, securing a match with my 4th priority is strategically sound at this stage of market closure."
