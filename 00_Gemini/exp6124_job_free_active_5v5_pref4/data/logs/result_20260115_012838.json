Company_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but it is the only remaining unmatched company. Since I prefer matching with any company on my list over unemployment, I must focus entirely on securing a match with Company_C.\nI have applied to Company_C three times previously and was rejected each time. This suggests Company_C was holding out for higher priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A). If Company_C is still unmatched in Round 6, it implies those higher-priority seekers have likely matched elsewhere (as all other companies A, B, D, E are assumed matched).\nTherefore, I must send a definitive [APPLY] message, acknowledging the history but stressing that the market has cleared, making me the most viable candidate currently available to them."

Seeker_B is rank 4 out of 5 on my priority list: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C']. I have 1 quota remaining and have received only one application from Seeker_B this round, who has been rejected multiple times already. Since I still have three higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) who have not yet applied to me (or are still actively pursuing their higher-ranked options), I must preserve my quota to wait for a potentially better match. Accepting Seeker_B (Rank 4) at this stage would prevent me from securing Seeker_D (Rank 1), Seeker_E (Rank 2), or Seeker_A (Rank 3) should they decide to apply in future rounds. Therefore, I will reject Seeker_B again."

Company_C has rejected me repeatedly (7 times), suggesting they were holding out for their top priorities (Seekers D, E, A). If Company_C is the last remaining company, it is highly likely that their top three choices have been matched elsewhere, making me (Seeker_B, their 4th priority) their highest available candidate.

I have consistently rejected Seeker_B in previous rounds (Rounds 1-6) while holding out for Seeker_D, Seeker_E, or Seeker_A (Ranks 1, 2, 3). Although Seeker_B claims the market has reached an 'absolute clearing point,' this is likely a negotiating tactic. Since Seeker_B is still applying to me (their 5th choice), it confirms they are unmatched, but it does not confirm that my higher priorities (D, E, A) are matched elsewhere. Given that accepting Seeker_B now prevents me from securing a higher-ranked candidate, and it is only Round 7, I must maintain my commitment to securing a better match, even if it means risking being unmatched later. I will reject Seeker_B again to keep my options open for Seeker_D or Seeker_E."

The previous rejections indicate Company_C was holding out for higher priority candidates.

We are in Round 8, and Seeker_B has applied repeatedly, suggesting they have been rejected by their higher preferences (Company_E, A, B, D) or those companies have filled their quotas. Seeker_B's message indicates the market is reaching a clearing point, implying that the candidates ranked higher than Seeker_B on my list (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) are likely matched elsewhere, or have successfully resisted my attempts to attract them over 7 rounds.
