Let's analyze the competition for C based on R1 strategies (everyone targets their Rank 1):\n1. Company_D receives A, C (if I apply there), D, E applications. Matches D-D.\n2.

Since Company_C has not matched yet, it indicates they are now forced to consider the remaining candidate(s).

Since it is still relatively early (Round 6) and my quota is 1, the strategic choice is to maintain my high standards and reject Seeker_B again, signaling that the position remains open for a candidate with a more specialized profile, while acknowledging the evolving market."

Given that Company_C is a low preference for D, E, and A (Rank 3 or 5), the probability of securing a match higher than Seeker_B is rapidly diminishing.
