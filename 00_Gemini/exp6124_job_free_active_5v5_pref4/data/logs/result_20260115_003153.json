This implies that all my higher-ranked preferences (E, A, B, D) are already matched with other seekers.

Given that Seeker_B is low priority, and I have not yet received applications from my top three choices, I must continue to hold out to maximize my priority match, especially since Seeker_B's persistence indicates they have run out of better options, suggesting they will likely apply again if rejected.
