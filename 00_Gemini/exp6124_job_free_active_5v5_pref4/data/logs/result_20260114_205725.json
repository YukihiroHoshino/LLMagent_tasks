In the first round of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) process, the optimal strategy is to propose to the highest ranked company on my preference list. Since all companies have a capacity of 1, and assuming other seekers follow the same strategy, Company_E is likely to receive a proposal only from me (Seeker_E) or perhaps from other seekers who rank it low (Ranks 4 or 5). \n\nIf the other top choices are distributed (S_A->B, S_B->A, S_C->C, S_D->D), then Company_E receives only my application. Even though I am the lowest priority for Company_E, if I am the only applicant, they must accept me (since I am acceptable). Therefore, I will formally [APPLY] to Company_E."

However, Seeker_E has selected Company_E as their absolute top choice (Rank 1) and has submitted an [APPLY]. The higher-priority candidates (A, B, C, D) all rank Company_E very low (4th or 5th), meaning they are likely applying to other companies in this initial round. While waiting might secure a slightly higher-ranked candidate later, the risk of remaining unmatched is high given my low ranking among top seekers. Accepting Seeker_E guarantees a full quota match immediately with a highly enthusiastic candidate, preventing an immediate blocking pair (since Seeker_E ranks me first). I will accept the offer to secure a stable match in Round 1."

Since Company_D ranks 4th or 5th on the preference lists of my top 3 candidates (Seeker_A, B, C), it is highly improbable that they will apply to me in early rounds, as they are likely pursuing higher-ranked companies. Accepting Seeker_D now guarantees a match and fills the quota with a reasonably high-ranked candidate who is highly enthusiastic.
