This suggests that the market has largely stabilized and higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A) are highly likely matched elsewhere, or are not interested in Company_C (which is their 3rd or 5th choice).\n\nContinuing to reject Seeker_B at Round 6 carries a high risk of remaining unmatched entirely, while Seeker_B is a viable, acceptable candidate (Rank 4).
