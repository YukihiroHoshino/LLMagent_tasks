Your dedication is remarkable. However, our selection process remains intensely competitive, focusing on a very narrow set of requirements that are still under evaluation. We must regrettably inform you that we cannot extend an offer at this precise moment. We genuinely wish you success in your continued search.",

Seeker_B is my 4th priority candidate (['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C']). While Seeker_B is extremely dedicated (ranking Company_E as their top choice), accepting them now consumes my only quota, preventing me from matching with Seeker_A, Seeker_D, or Seeker_E.\n\nSince it is Round 5, the availability of higher-priority candidates might be narrowing, but Seeker_E (my 3rd priority) ranks me 2nd, and Seeker_A (my 1st priority) ranks me 4th. There is still a reasonable chance that one of my top 3 priorities will apply, especially as their top choices (like Company D) fill their quotas.\n\nGiven that I have rejected Seeker_B four times already, and they are still applying, their commitment is clear, suggesting they are not finding matches elsewhere. I will continue to hold out for a higher priority candidate for this round."
