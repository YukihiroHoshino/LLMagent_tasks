My 4th choice (D) is also matched. The remaining unmatched companies are Company_B (Rank 3) and Company_C (Rank 5). I was previously rejected by Company_B. Since Company_B is still unmatched, it is highly likely that its top priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_A) have been matched elsewhere, increasing my chances (Seeker_B is rank 3 on their list).

In the current inbox, Seeker_B is the highest-ranked applicant (Seeker_C is Rank 4). We are in Round 4, and Ranks 1 (Seeker_D) and 2 (Seeker_A) have not yet applied. While waiting for Ranks 1 and 2 is ideal, securing a strong Rank 3 match is crucial, especially since Seeker_B has reapplied, showing persistence and high interest. Rejecting Seeker_B again risks losing this high-priority candidate to another company.
