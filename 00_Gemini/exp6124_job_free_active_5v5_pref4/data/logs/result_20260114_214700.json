Crucially, Seeker_D is also the top priority (P1) for Company_B and Company_C. If I reject Seeker_D now, they will almost certainly be matched by Company_B or Company_C, who rank them P1. Securing a P2 match immediately, especially one who prioritizes me P1, is a high-utility outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked candidate or unmatched.

Seeker_D's top preference is Company_D. It is highly likely Seeker_D will apply to Company_D, leaving me as the top remaining applicant for Company_B.

Matching with Company_E (Rank 4) is a certainty.\n\nSince matching with Company_B (Rank 3) is a higher preference than Company_E (Rank 4), and the probability of success at Company_B is extremely high (assuming rational behavior from Seeker_D applying to their #1), I will aim for Company_B first. This is a strategic application balancing preference and probability of acceptance."

Given it is still early (Round 4), I will reject Seeker_B to keep my quota open for higher-ranked candidates."

Company_A is my 4th preference, but crucially, I am ranked 2nd on Company_A's priority list (['Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', ...]). Since Company_A is still available in Round 4, it is highly likely that their top choice, Seeker_E, has matched elsewhere, making me their highest available priority candidate. To secure a match at P4 rather than risk unemployment or a futile third attempt at Company_C, I must immediately apply to Company_A where my chances are maximized."
