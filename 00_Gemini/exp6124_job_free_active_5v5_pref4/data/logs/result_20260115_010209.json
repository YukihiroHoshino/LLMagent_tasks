I have rejected Seeker_B's applications in previous rounds, signaling that I am holding out for higher-ranked candidates. Since I still have my full quota (1) and it is only Round 5, accepting Seeker_B (Rank 4) now would close off the opportunity to match with Seeker_D (Rank 1) or Seeker_E (Rank 2), both of whom list Company_C as their 3rd preference. I need to maintain my strategy of waiting for higher-ranked candidates to finalize their decisions. Therefore, I must reject Seeker_B again."

Only Company_C (Rank 5, my lowest preference) remains unmatched.\nI have applied to Company_C three times previously and been rejected, despite emphasizing commitment. However, since all other companies (A, B, D, E) are now matched, Company_C is the only remaining option for me to avoid unemployment, and I prefer matching with Company_C over unemployment.\nGiven that Company_C is still unmatched in Round 6, it is highly likely that its higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_E, Seeker_A) have matched elsewhere. Company_C must now settle for either Seeker_B (4th priority) or Seeker_C (5th priority).\nI must apply again, using the current market dynamics (last available company/seeker) to force a stable match. I will emphasize that this match is now mutually optimal and necessary for closure."

I have repeatedly rejected Seeker_B in previous rounds, holding out for higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A). However, we are now in Round 6, and Seeker_B's message strongly suggests the market is nearly depleted, positioning this as a necessary and final match. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched if I continue to reject B, and since Seeker_B is not my lowest priority (Seeker_C is), securing this match ensures I fulfill my quota (1) and achieve stability, even if it is with a moderately lower-ranked candidate. I will accept Seeker_B's definitive application."
