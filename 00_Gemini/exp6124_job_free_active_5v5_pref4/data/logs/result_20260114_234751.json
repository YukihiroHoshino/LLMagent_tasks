Company_D (P1): Highly competitive. Seeker_D's P1 is Company_D, and they are P2 for D. Seeker_B is P1 for D. If Seeker_D applies to D, I (P3 for D) will likely be rejected.\n2. Company_E (P2): Seeker_A is P1 for E. If Seeker_A applies, I (P3 for E) will be rejected.\n3. Company_C (P3): Seeker_D is P1 for C. However, Seeker_D's P1 company is D. It is highly rational for Seeker_D to apply to Company_D. If Seeker_D applies elsewhere, I become the highest priority applicant for Company_C (P2 for C). Since Company_C is my P3, securing this match in Round 1 is an excellent outcome.\n4. Company_A (P5): I am P1 for A, guaranteeing acceptance, but it is my lowest preference. I should aim higher first.\n\nStrategy: Apply immediately to Company_C, anticipating that Seeker_D will apply to their top choice (Company_D), thus allowing me (P2 for C) to secure the position."

It is highly probable that Seeker_D will match with a higher preferred Company this round or soon, meaning waiting for them carries significant risk of remaining unmatched or settling for a much lower priority.\nSeeker_E is an excellent candidate (Rank 2).

Although Seeker_B is my #1 choice, Seeker_B prefers three other companies (E, A, B) before me, making it risky to reject Seeker_D on the hope that Seeker_B will apply later.
