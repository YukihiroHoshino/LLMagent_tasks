Seeker_B's argument—that the higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A) are likely matched elsewhere given the late stage of the process—is compelling and likely accurate, as those seekers are highly desirable across the market. If I continue to hold out, I risk ending up unmatched, especially since Seeker_B is the highest available candidate remaining on my list.
