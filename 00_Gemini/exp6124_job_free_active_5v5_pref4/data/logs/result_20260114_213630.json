Company_B.\n\nChecking Company_D's priority list: ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_A']. Seeker_D is highly ranked (2nd overall). Analyzing potential competition suggests that Seeker_B (rank 1) will propose to Company_E. This makes Seeker_D the highest priority applicant likely applying to Company_D in this round.
