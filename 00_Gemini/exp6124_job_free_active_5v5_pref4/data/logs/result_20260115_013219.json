Given that 4 other seekers also rank Company_D highly, an immediate application to D is likely to result in rejection by higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D and Seeker_E are likely applicants and ranked higher than me, and Seeker_B is ranked highest overall). \n\nI must look for a company where my priority ranking is high, even if my preference ranking is lower, to secure a match early.\n\nCompany_A is my 4th preference, but critically, Company_A ranks me (Seeker_C) 2nd overall (Priority: ['Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B']).\n\nSeeker_E (A's top priority) is likely to apply to Company_D (E's 1st choice). If Seeker_E applies to D, they won't apply to A in R1. If Seeker_E is elsewhere, I become the highest priority applicant at Company_A.\n\nApplying to Company_A in Round 1 offers the highest probability of securing a match immediately, albeit with my 4th choice.
