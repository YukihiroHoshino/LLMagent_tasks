Since it is only Round 4, and I have not received applications from my top 3 priorities, rejecting Seeker_B is the optimal strategy to maximize my priority score. Seeker_B's preference for C is very low (last place), suggesting they are likely applying to C only after failing elsewhere, reinforcing the need to hold out for candidates who might still be available and rank higher on my list."
