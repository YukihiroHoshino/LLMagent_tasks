Company_E ranks me 3rd ('Seeker_E').\n\nAnalyzing likely applicants for Company_E:\n1. Seeker_A (C_E Rank 1) prefers C_D or C_A (C_E is 4th on S_A list).\n2. Seeker_D (C_E Rank 2) prefers C_D (C_E is 5th on S_D list).\n3. Seeker_B (C_E Rank 4) prefers C_E (C_E is 1st on S_B list).\n\nIf I apply to Company_E, the main competition is Seeker_B. Since Company_E ranks me (Seeker_E, rank 3) higher than Seeker_B (rank 4), if we both apply, Company_E will accept me. This provides a high probability of securing my second most desired position immediately in Round 1. This is a strategic move to maximize utility."
