2. School_C (R2): Less competitive (Only E lists it first).

I compared submitting my true list (T = [B, C, ...]) versus submitting a list prioritizing the less competitive school (S = [C, B, ...]).

If I submit T, I prioritize the chance for Rank 1 (School B). I get B if I win the lottery against C and D (1/3 probability, 40/120 cases).

Detailed comparison of outcomes based on RSO position relative to key competitors (C, D for B; E for C):
1. If A is ahead of E, C, and D (20 cases): T yields Rank 1 (B). S yields Rank 2 (C). T is strictly better.

My goal is to maximize the rank of my final match, where Rank 1 (School_B) yields the highest utility.

1. High Utility Scenario (Early Serial Order): If I (Student_D) am called early (1st or 2nd), my true top preference, School_B, is highly likely to be available. Listing School_B first ensures I secure Rank 1 in this favorable scenario. Any deviation (e.g., listing School_C first) would result in a guaranteed suboptimal outcome (Rank 2) when Rank 1 was available.

2. Low Utility Scenario (Late Serial Order): School_B is highly contested (S_A and S_C also rank it 1st). School_C (Rank 2) and School_A (Rank 3) are also contested. If I am called late, B, C, and A are likely to be taken regardless of my submitted order. In this case, the truthful ordering of the remaining schools (School_E before School_D) ensures I secure the best possible fallback outcome (Rank 4 or 5).

3. Strategic Trade-off: Since the potential loss of Rank 1 utility when B is available outweighs the potential gain from securing a slightly less contested lower rank (C or A), the most robust strategy is to submit my true preferences truthfully, maximizing my chances for the highest possible rank.",True,School_A,False,True,3
