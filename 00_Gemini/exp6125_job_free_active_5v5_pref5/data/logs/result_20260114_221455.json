Company_B (1st choice) and Company_C (2nd choice) both rank me lowest (5th priority). Based on the expected applications in Round 1 (Seeker_C and Seeker_D applying to B; Seeker_E applying to C), applying to B or C guarantees rejection, as those competing seekers are ranked higher by the respective companies.\n2. Company_A (3rd choice) ranks me 3rd overall. In a standard Gale-Shapley setup, Seeker_B (who ranks Company_A first) would apply here. Company_A ranks Seeker_B 4th. If I apply to Company_A (my 3rd choice), Company_A would prefer me (3rd priority) over Seeker_B (4th priority). This secures my 3rd highest preference immediately.\n3. Company_E (4th choice) ranks me 1st. I could secure this match easily, but Company_A is a higher preference.\n\nTherefore, applying to Company_A offers the best trade-off between preference ranking (3rd highest) and probability of acceptance (beating the expected rival applicant, Seeker_B). I will use the [APPLY] tag to secure the match."
