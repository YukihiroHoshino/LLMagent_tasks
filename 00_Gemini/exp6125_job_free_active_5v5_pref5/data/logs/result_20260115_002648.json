Company_A prioritizes me (Seeker_A) 3rd overall, ahead of Seeker_B (4th) and Seeker_C (5th). Seeker_B's top preference is Company_A, meaning they are likely to apply immediately. If both Seeker_A and Seeker_B apply to Company_A, Company_A will accept me (Seeker_A) because I am preferred (Rank 3 vs Rank 4).
