Applying to C_B is a guaranteed rejection, but it helps clear the market.\n\nAnalyzing C_C (My P2):\nCompany_C prioritizes S_B, S_C, S_D. I am 3rd.

If S_B and S_C follow their preferences and apply to C_B (where S_B is likely accepted), C_C will receive my application only, ensuring a match with my second highest preferred company.
