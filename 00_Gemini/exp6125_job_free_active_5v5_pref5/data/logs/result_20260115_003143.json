Despite applying five times previously and being rejected due to specialized requirements (and being ranked last, P5, on Company_D's priority list), I must apply again, as this is the only remaining option to secure a match. Since Company_D is still unmatched in Round 6, it indicates their higher priority candidates (Seeker_D, A, C, E) are likely matched elsewhere, or they have simply refused to compromise. My strategy must now emphasize the cost of their continued unemployment (the open position) versus my guaranteed immediate availability and high commitment, hoping they finally settle for the best available candidate."

However, Company_D operates under a strict quota of one position, which requires a highly specific and specialized skill set matching our immediate technical demands.

Seeker_B is applying for the sixth time and is my lowest priority candidate (P5). While it is Round 6 and the risk of remaining unmatched increases, accepting the lowest priority candidate now means sacrificing the chance of matching with P3 (Seeker_C, who ranks D 3rd) or P4 (Seeker_E, who ranks D 2nd). The persistence of Seeker_B applying suggests they have exhausted higher preferences, but it does not confirm that P3 or P4 are matched yet. Given the specific goal to maximize priority, I will risk one more round and maintain the rejection stance used previously, emphasizing the specialized nature of the single role, hoping to attract P3 or P4 soon."

Seeker_B has been rejected six times by Company_D, who claimed they were holding out for a more specialized candidate. However, since Company_D is still unmatched in Round 7, it is highly probable that all candidates ranked higher than Seeker_B on Company_D's priority list (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_E) have found matches elsewhere (as Companies A, B, C, and E are matched). This situation creates immense pressure on Company_D to accept Seeker_B, as rejecting Seeker_B now carries the high risk of remaining unmatched entirely.
