As previously confirmed, we are delighted to finalize this match immediately. We formally accept your application, and welcome you to Company D!",
              "thought": "I am Company_D, and my quota is 1. Seeker_C is my 3rd priority (['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']). My top two priorities (D and A) rank Company_D as their lowest choice (5th), making securing them highly uncertain. Seeker_C has applied repeatedly and indicated a strong commitment to finalizing the match now. Given the stability of this match and Seeker_C's respectable rank, securing this position now (Round 4) is a prudent use of my single quota, rather than risking being unmatched while waiting for unlikely candidates. I will accept Seeker_C to finalize the agreement."
