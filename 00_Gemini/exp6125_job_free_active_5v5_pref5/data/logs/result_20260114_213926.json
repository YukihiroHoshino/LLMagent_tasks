We recognize your unwavering commitment and appreciate the detailed reiteration of your qualifications.

My priority list is: Seeker_E (P1), Seeker_D (P2), Seeker_A (P3), Seeker_B (P4), Seeker_C (P5). Seeker_B is my 4th choice. I have been rejecting Seeker_B repeatedly to hold my quota open for P1, P2, and P3 candidates. Since I still have my full quota (1) and it is only Round 5, I must continue to hold out for a higher-ranked candidate (E, D, or A). Seeker_B is highly dedicated (Company_A is their P1) and will likely persist or return if unmatched elsewhere, making them a safe fallback. Therefore, I will reject Seeker_B again to maintain strategic flexibility."

Given that you remain unmatched, it is clear that the candidates you prioritized have secured positions elsewhere.

To secure a stable outcome for both parties and conclude this hiring cycle efficiently, I formally apply now. I am the match you need.",

Despite four previous rejections, Company_A remains unmatched, indicating that their higher-priority candidates (Seeker_E, Seeker_D, Seeker_A) have secured matches elsewhere. Since this is Round 6 and Company_A still has capacity, they must now prioritize filling the slot over maintaining strict preference criteria. I must apply aggressively, emphasizing that I am the dedicated and reliable candidate remaining in the market, making this a necessary and mutually beneficial match to conclude the hiring process."

I have repeatedly rejected Seeker_B in previous rounds (R1 through R5) hoping to secure a match with higher priority candidates (Seeker_E P1, Seeker_D P2, or Seeker_A P3). Since it is Round 6, and I remain unmatched, the probability of securing P1 or P2 is extremely low, as they have likely matched with their preferred companies (Company_B or Company_C). While I previously rejected Seeker_A (P3), I must now recognize the shifting market dynamics. Seeker_B's dedication has been unwavering, and they represent a viable match on my priority list. Securing a P4 match is far superior to remaining unmatched. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_B to finalize my quota."
