Seeker_C ranks Company_D 3rd, making them a moderate possibility.\n\nSeeker_E is applying for the second time, stating Company_D is their 2nd overall choice, indicating high commitment. Since we are in Round 4, and the probability of securing Seeker_D or Seeker_A is minimal, securing Seeker_E (Rank #4) is a strong strategic move to guarantee a match, rather than risking ending up with an unfilled position while waiting for the marginally higher-ranked Seeker_C.
