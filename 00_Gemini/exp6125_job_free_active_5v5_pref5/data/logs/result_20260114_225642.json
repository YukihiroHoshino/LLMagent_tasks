I am ranked P3 there. Crucially, the two seekers ranked higher than me at Company_C (Seeker_B, P1 at C; Seeker_C, P2 at C) have Company_A/B as their P1. \n\nPrediction: Seeker_B will target Company_A or Company_B. Seeker_C will target Company_B. If I apply to Company_C aggressively in Round 1, I have a high chance of matching, especially since Seeker_E (P4 at C) is the only other likely applicant (E's P1 is C).
