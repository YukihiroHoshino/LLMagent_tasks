Given that Company_B is the top choice for Seeker_C and Seeker_D, who are ranked higher than me by Company_B, a direct application to B in Round 1 is highly likely to result in rejection, potentially leaving me with only my 5th choice (D) remaining in subsequent rounds, as A, B, and C are likely to be matched quickly.\n\nCompany_E is my 4th preference, but crucially, I am ranked 1st by Company_E. Since Company_E is ranked low (4th or 5th) by all other seekers, it is highly probable that I will be the only applicant, or at least the most preferred applicant, securing a match immediately. Securing my 4th preference now is a much better outcome than risking rejection and ending up with my 5th preference later, or remaining unmatched.\n\nI will target Company_E and send a formal [APPLY]."
