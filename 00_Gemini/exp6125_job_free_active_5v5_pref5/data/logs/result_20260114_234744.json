I previously applied (Round 2 or 3) and was rejected, with Company_D citing 'current hiring needs and team composition requirements.' Since the company is still unmatched in Round 4, it suggests their higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D, A, C) are either matched elsewhere or have rejected Company_D. As my 2nd preference, and the last available option before unemployment, I must make a strong, final attempt to secure the match. I will re-apply, emphasizing my dedication and immediate availability, hoping that Company_D is now willing to settle for their 4th priority (Seeker_E)."

Accepting Seeker_E now would prevent me from matching with my top three candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C). Although Seeker_E is demonstrating strong dedication by reapplying after a previous rejection, it is too early in the process (Round 4) to settle for a 4th-ranked candidate when higher-ranked options have not yet contacted me or been matched elsewhere. I must preserve my quota for higher priorities."

Currently, Company_D is the only remaining unmatched company. All other companies appear to be matched (as they are not in the 'not yet matched' list). Although Company_D previously rejected me twice (as I am ranked 4th on their priority list), the current market dynamics suggest that their higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C) are likely matched elsewhere, given that 4 out of 5 companies have filled their quotas. If I do not match with Company_D now, I remain unemployed. Therefore, I must make a final, strong application, leveraging the fact that I am likely the only available applicant for their remaining spot."

While I previously rejected Seeker_E hoping for my top 3 priorities (D, A, C) to apply, waiting further into Round 5 carries a high risk of failing to fill the quota. Given Seeker_E's persistence and high availability, and the indication that higher-ranked candidates may already be matched elsewhere, securing a match with my 4th priority is a prudent move to fulfill my objective."
