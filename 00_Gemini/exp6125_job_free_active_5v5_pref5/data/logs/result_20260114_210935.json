This makes an immediate match with Company_B unlikely (likely going to Seeker_C).\n\nMy second preference is Company_C. I am ranked 3rd by Company_C (behind S_B, S_C). \n\nAnalyzing predicted Round 1 applications based on top preferences:\n- S_A, S_C, S_D (Me) target B.\n- S_B targets A.\n- S_E targets C.\n\nIf I target Company_C instead of Company_B, Company_C receives applications from S_D (Me) and S_E. Company_C's priority list places S_D (3rd) above S_E (4th). Therefore, if only S_E and S_D apply, Company_C will accept me.
