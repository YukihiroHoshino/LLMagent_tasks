Company_A ranks Seeker_B 4th. If Company_A receives applications from higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_E or Seeker_D), Seeker_B will be rejected and will likely approach Company_B (their 2nd choice) in Round 2. \n\nAccepting Seeker_C now closes my opportunity to match with Seeker_B. Rejecting Seeker_C is a calculated risk to maximize my priority score. Although Seeker_C might match with Company_C (their 2nd choice, where C ranks them 2nd), the potential gain of securing Seeker_B outweighs the risk of losing Seeker_C and having to settle for Seeker_D or Seeker_A later.

Seeker_B is targeting Company_A (Rank 1 preference), and Seeker_C is targeting Company_B (Rank 1 preference). This leaves me (Seeker_D) as the 3rd highest priority applicant available for Company_C, competing mainly with Seeker_E (who is targeting C as their Rank 1 choice, but E is 4th priority for C).\n\nIf I apply to Company_C, I am prioritized (3rd) above Seeker_E (4th).
