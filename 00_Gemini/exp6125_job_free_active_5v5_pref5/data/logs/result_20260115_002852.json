Company_D is ranked 3rd on my list, making it highly desirable given the current limited options. I have previously applied to Company_D and was rejected in a previous round, but the rejection suggested they were still evaluating the pool. Since this is the final available company, I must re-apply immediately and assertively. Company_D ranks me 3rd on their priority list. Assuming the higher-ranked seekers (Seeker_D and Seeker_A) are now matched with the other four companies (A, B, C, E), I am likely their top remaining candidate. I will use the [APPLY] tag."

My highest priority candidates are Seeker_D (Rank 1) and Seeker_A (Rank 2), but both rank Company_D last (5th) in their preferences, making it highly unlikely they will approach me unless they fail to match with 4 other companies. Seeker_C is my 3rd priority, a strong candidate. Seeker_C has applied twice and now states that Company_D is their 'final outstanding opportunity.' This indicates Seeker_C is highly motivated and available, likely having been rejected by their top two choices (B and C). Given the late stage (Round 4) and the low probability of securing my top two candidates who rank me last, securing a reliable Rank 3 match now is the optimal strategy to maximize my priority satisfaction and prevent Seeker_C from matching with a lower-priority company (like Company_E, who ranks C highly). I will accept Seeker_C."
