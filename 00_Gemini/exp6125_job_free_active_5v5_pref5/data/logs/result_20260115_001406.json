Analyze Company_B (My #1):\n   - Company_B's priority list: ['Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A']. I am ranked 4th.\n   - Competition: Seeker_C (C's #1) is ranked 3rd by Company_B. If S_C applies, I will be rejected.\n   - Applying to C_B is too risky in Round 1, leading to likely rejection and loss of opportunity.\n\n2. Analyze Company_C (My #2):\n   - Company_C's priority list: ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_A']. I am ranked 3rd.\n   - Competition analysis based on assumed top choices:\n     - Seeker_B (Rank 1 at C_C) is likely aiming for Company_A (#1 for S_B).\n     - Seeker_C (Rank 2 at C_C) is likely aiming for Company_B (#1 for S_C).\n     - Seeker_E (Rank 4 at C_C) is likely aiming for Company_C (#1 for S_E).\n   - If Seeker_E applies to Company_C, and I (Seeker_D) apply to Company_C, Company_C will choose Seeker_D (Rank 3) over Seeker_E (Rank 4).\n\n3. Conclusion:\n   Applying to Company_C maximizes my chances of immediate success with my second-highest preference, minimizing the risk of being rejected by a higher-ranked competitor (like S_C at C_B) and securing a match before other highly ranked candidates (like S_E) can take it."
