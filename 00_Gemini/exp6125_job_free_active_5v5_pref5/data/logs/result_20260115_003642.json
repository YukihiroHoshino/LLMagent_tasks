This is the highest priority ranking I receive from any company.\n3. Analyzing competition for Company_A: The seekers ranked higher than me (Seeker_E, Seeker_D) both have higher preferences elsewhere (E prefers C; D prefers B). If they follow their top preferences, Company_A will likely receive applications from Seeker_B (A is B's 1st choice, but A ranks B 4th) and me (A is A's 3rd choice, A ranks A 3rd).
