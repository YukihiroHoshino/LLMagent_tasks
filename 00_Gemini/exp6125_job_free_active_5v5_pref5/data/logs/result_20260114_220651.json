Since we are now in Round 4 and the other four companies are matched, it is highly probable that Company_D's higher priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C) have been matched elsewhere. This significantly improves Seeker_E's standing (who is D's 4th preference). I must use a final, definitive [APPLY] message that leverages the market closure and Seeker_E's high preference for Company_D to secure the match."

We have been highly impressed by your qualifications and your consistent dedication throughout this process. We have finalized our evaluations and agree that your profile is an excellent fit for our requirements. We are pleased to offer you the position immediately.",
              "thought": "I am Company_D, and my quota is 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']. Seeker_E is my 4th priority. I have previously rejected Seeker_E twice, hoping for a match with higher-ranked candidates (D, A, C). However, higher-ranked candidates (D and A) rank Company_D very low (Rank #5), making a match unlikely unless they are rejected by everyone else. Seeker_C (Rank #3) is a possibility, but they rank me #3 and are likely pursuing their top choices (B and C). Seeker_E is highly motivated, ranking Company_D as their #2 preference, and is applying strongly for the third time, indicating commitment. Given that we are in Round 4, and the highest priority candidates have not applied, holding out further risks ending up unmatched entirely. Securing a Rank #4 match who is eager to join is a prudent decision at this stage."
