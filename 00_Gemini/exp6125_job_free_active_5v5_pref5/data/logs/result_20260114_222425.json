Your profile, combined with your demonstrated dedication, assures us of your immediate value to our team. After careful review of the current market landscape and your continued enthusiasm, we are pleased to formally [ACCEPT] your application. Welcome to Company_D.",
              "thought": "I am Company_D, and my quota is 1. Seeker_E is my 4th priority (P4). I have previously rejected Seeker_E twice in hopes of securing a higher priority candidate (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, or Seeker_C). We are now in Round 4, and Seeker_E is demonstrating absolute commitment (listing me as their #2 preference and applying for the third time). Given that my top priorities (D and A) rank Company_D last, and Seeker_C is highly sought after by other companies, the probability of securing a P1, P2, or P3 candidate is diminishing rapidly. To mitigate the risk of failing to fill my single quota, securing a highly committed candidate who is still within my acceptable priority range (P4) is strategically sound at this stage. I will accept Seeker_E."
