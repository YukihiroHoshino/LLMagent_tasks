Company_B (Rank 1) is matched (rejected me, position filled).\n2. Company_A (Rank 3) is matched (rejected me, position filled).\n3. Company_E (Rank 4) is matched (rejected me, position filled).\n\nThe list of unmatched companies is ['Company_D']. This implies Company_C (Rank 2) is also matched, as it is not active.\n\nCompany_D (Rank 5) is the last and lowest acceptable option available on my preference list. Since I prefer matching with any company on my list rather than remaining unemployed, I must apply to Company_D immediately to secure a match.\n\nGiven that Company_D has not matched yet, and I am their top priority (from the overall context data, though I don't strictly use this knowledge in the message, it informs the confidence of the action), a formal [APPLY] is the appropriate action to finalize the matching process."
