All companies except Company_D are now matched, as they are not listed in the 'companies not yet matched' list. Company_D is my 4th choice. I have already applied to Company_D once and was rejected, likely because I am their lowest priority candidate (P5). Since Company_D is the only remaining option and the market is closing (Round 5), they must have failed to secure their higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C, Seeker_E). I must apply again, making a final, strong appeal, banking on the fact that they need to fill their quota and I am the only available option left for them. Remaining unemployed is worse than matching with my 4th choice."

I have rejected Seeker_B twice already, aiming for higher-ranked candidates (D, A, C). Since this is only Round 5, and I still have high-priority candidates (especially Seeker_C, who ranks Company_D third) potentially available, it is strategically sound to hold my quota open rather than settling for P5, especially since Seeker_B has shown persistent interest, suggesting they may remain available longer.

Although I was rejected twice before, those rejections likely occurred because Company_D was holding out for higher-priority candidates (Seeker_D, A, C, E).\nSince Company_D is still unmatched in Round 6, it is extremely likely that all candidates prioritized above me have successfully matched with companies they prefer more (A, B, C, E).\nTherefore, Seeker_B is now the highest priority available candidate for Company_D (P5 on their list). I must apply aggressively now, as this is the final opportunity to secure a match and avoid unemployment, which is ranked below E.\nI will use the [APPLY] tag."

It is Round 7, and I have rejected Seeker_B four times and Seeker_E once, hoping to secure a top-3 candidate (D, A, C). Seeker_B is applying for the fifth time, asserting that the market has stabilized and Company_D is the 'sole capacity available.' This strongly suggests that candidates D, A, C, and E have matched with their higher-preferred companies (as Company_D is a low preference for D and A, and mid-preference for C). While Seeker_B is my lowest priority candidate, securing this match prevents the risk of remaining unmatched, which would be the worst outcome. Given the late stage of negotiations and the persistent applications, it is strategically sound to accept Seeker_B now to fulfill the quota."
