This is a highly favorable position. If the preferred candidate for Company_A (Seeker_E) targets their own top choice (Company_C), and I apply to Company_A, I have a very strong chance of being accepted immediately, potentially securing a P3 match in Round 1. If Seeker_B (who prefers Company_A) also applies, I still outrank them (D is 2nd, B is 4th on A's list). \n\nI will pivot to Company_A and use [APPLY] to capitalize on my high priority ranking there."
