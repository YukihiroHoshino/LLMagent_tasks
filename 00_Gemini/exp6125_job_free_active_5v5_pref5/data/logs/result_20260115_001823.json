My preference list is: ['Company_B', 'Company_C', 'Company_A', 'Company_E', 'Company_D'].\n2. I have been rejected by Company_B (Rank 1), Company_C (Rank 2), and Company_E (Rank 4). Company_A (Rank 3) is not on the active list, implying it is matched.\n3. The only remaining unmatched company is Company_D (Rank 5).\n4. Although Company_D is my lowest preference, it is still preferred over remaining unmatched (unemployed). \n5. Critically, Company_D ranks Seeker_D as their absolute top priority: ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_B']. Applying to Company_D guarantees a match. \n6. Therefore, I must apply to Company_D now to secure a stable match."
