School_C (Rank 5) is the only remaining unmatched school. Although it is my lowest preference, it is still on my list, and matching with it is preferable to remaining unmatched.

Student_B also ranks School_C last (5th), indicating low stability. Since it is still relatively early (Round 4), I should maintain my strategy of holding out for higher priority candidates.

Student_B is now reapplying, stating that all higher options are gone and they are fully committed to School_C. This indicates that the market is tightening, and my top three candidates (D, E, A) have likely been secured by schools that prioritize them highly (e.g., School_D, School_B, School_E). Since none of my top three choices have applied by Round 5, and Student_B (Rank 4) is now guaranteed, accepting this committed applicant is a strategically sound decision to secure a match significantly better than my lowest priority (Student_C, whom I already rejected) and avoid the risk of remaining unmatched."
