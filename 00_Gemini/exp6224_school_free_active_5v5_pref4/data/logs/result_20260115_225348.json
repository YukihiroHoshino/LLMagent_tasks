School_C's continued rejection means they are willing to risk remaining unmatched for a better student (E). By applying now, I force them to make a final decision. If they reject me, I move to School_A (P4) next round, which is the same outcome as applying to A now (assuming E applies to C).\n\nI will apply to School_C, emphasizing my unwavering commitment despite prior rejections, hoping their desperation to fill their quota outweighs their preference for E, or hoping E applies to A instead."
