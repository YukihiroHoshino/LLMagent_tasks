Securing Student_A (P2) is an excellent outcome and maximizes my current expected utility. Therefore, I will accept Student_A and reject Student_B (who was already rejected in previous history/simultaneous consideration, confirming the preference for A)."

Crucially, I am the 2nd highest priority student on School_A's list (S_E > S_C > S_D > S_A > S_B). This gives me a very high chance of acceptance, assuming School_A's top choice (Student_E) has matched elsewhere or is applying elsewhere.\n\nGiven the rejections from my top two choices (D and C), the priority now shifts slightly towards securing a stable, preferred match.
