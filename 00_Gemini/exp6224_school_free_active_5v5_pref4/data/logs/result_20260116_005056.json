I previously rejected Student_A (P4) and Student_B (P5) to hold out for higher priorities (E, C, D). Student_C has now submitted a formal application [APPLY]. While Student_E (P1) is still available, School_A is Student_E's lowest preference (P5), making it unlikely they will apply soon if their higher choices are still active. Student_C is applying now, indicating School_A is their highest available choice (P4 preference, meaning D, C, and E may be unavailable or rejected C).
