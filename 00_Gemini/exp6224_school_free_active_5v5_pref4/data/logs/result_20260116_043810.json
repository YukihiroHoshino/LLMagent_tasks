I am the 4th priority on School_A's list. The students ranked higher than me (E, C, D) all prefer School_D (#1 preference) strongly.

We appreciate your consideration of School_C, even as your final preference.

We are unable to extend an offer at this time. We wish you success in securing a placement.",

While Student_B has applied, accepting them now (Round 3) would fill my quota, preventing me from matching with my higher-ranked targets (D, E, A), who may still be available or applying soon after being rejected by their top choices. Student_B also explicitly stated School_C is their final preference, indicating low commitment relative to other potential candidates. Consistent with the previous rejection of Student_C (my 5th choice), I must hold out for a student ranked 1-3. Therefore, I will reject Student_B."

I have already been rejected by my top two choices (School_E, School_A) and also previously by my last choice (School_C). The current list of unmatched schools only contains ['School_C']. This means all other schools (A, B, D, E) have likely filled their quotas and are off the market, leaving School_C as the only remaining option on my preference list. Although School_C previously rejected me (likely prioritizing Student D, E, or A, who rank higher than me), the market has shifted. If School_C is still unmatched, it means their top candidates either matched elsewhere or are still available but haven't applied to C yet. Since I am ranked 4th by School_C, and I have no other options, I must re-apply and stress my commitment, hoping that School_C's higher-priority students are now matched elsewhere, making me their best available candidate."

My quota is 1.\nStudent_B (P4) is reapplying with an [APPLY] tag, emphasizing commitment despite School_C being their P5 preference. I previously rejected Student_B and Student_C (P5).\nWe are in Round 4. While P1, P2, and P3 are preferred, their failure to apply suggests they are either matched elsewhere or holding out for higher preferences that are also highly competitive. Holding out further significantly increases the risk of ending up unmatched or forced to accept Student_C (P5) later.\nStudent_B is the highest-ranked student currently applying and is showing persistent dedication. Accepting P4 guarantees a match, which is a good outcome given the market competitiveness and the risk of remaining unmatched. I will accept Student_B."
