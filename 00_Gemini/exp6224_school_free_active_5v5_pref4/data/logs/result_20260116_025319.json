School_C is my absolute highest remaining preference.\nI have been rejected twice by School_C, who is holding out for higher priority candidates (Students D, E, A, B). Since Schools D, E, and A are no longer in the unmatched list, it is highly probable that Students D, E, and A have been matched elsewhere, meaning School_C's top three priorities are gone. School_C is likely waiting only for Student_B.\nIf Student_B applies to School_B (which is their higher preference, P3, compared to School_C, P5), School_C will be left with only me (Student_C, P5 for School_C). Although School_C is extremely patient, I must attempt to secure my P2 now by highlighting the market reality and the high risk they face of remaining unmatched if they continue to wait for Student_B.\nI will apply to School_C one last time before resorting to School_B (P5)."

Your commitment to School_C, demonstrated by your P2 preference and continued applications, is highly valued.

Student_C correctly points out that P1-P3 are likely matched elsewhere (D, E, A are highly sought after). This leaves Student_B (P4) as the highest remaining priority target. However, School_C is Student_B's P5 choice, making it highly unlikely B will apply unless rejected everywhere else. Crucially, Student_C views School_C as their P2 choice, and if rejected again, Student_C is likely to secure a match elsewhere (e.g., School_A ranks Student_C as P2). If I reject Student_C now, I risk losing the only dedicated applicant (P5) while waiting for an unlikely applicant (P4), potentially leaving School_C unmatched. Given the depth of the process (Round 4) and the risk of being left unmatched, securing P5 is the strategically sound move."

Since School_D and School_A are now matched (as they are not on the 'not yet matched' list), I, Student_B, am now the highest ranked remaining applicant for School_B (I am rank 3 on their list).
