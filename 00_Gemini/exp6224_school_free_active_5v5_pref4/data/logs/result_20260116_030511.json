Since School_C is the only school listed as unmatched, and 4 other schools (A, B, D, E) must be matched, it is highly probable that the higher priority students for School_C (D, E, A, B) have secured matches elsewhere. School_C previously rejected me twice while claiming to be reviewing the full applicant pool (i.e., waiting for better candidates). If those candidates are gone, School_C is now facing the prospect of remaining unmatched unless they accept me (their lowest priority applicant, P5). I must apply aggressively for the third time, emphasizing immediate acceptance and the finality of the market clearing, utilizing School_C's potential desperation."

Although Student_C is highly committed, accepting them now would preclude matching with four higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A, B). Since I still have quota 1 and the simulation is early (Round 4), I must maintain my selectivity and wait for a higher-priority student to apply or become available. Therefore, I must reject Student_C again."
