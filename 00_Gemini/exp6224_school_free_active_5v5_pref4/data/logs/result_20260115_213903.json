Since School_A has a quota of 1 and has already rejected lower-ranked students (A and B), securing a match with the second-highest priority student is an excellent outcome. While Student_E (Rank 1) is preferred, waiting for Student_E is risky as Student_E has multiple higher-ranked school preferences (D, E, C) and those schools also prioritize Student_E highly. Given the small quota, securing this high-priority match now is the optimal strategy."
