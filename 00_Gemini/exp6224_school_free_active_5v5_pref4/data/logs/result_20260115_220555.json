I have a quota of 1 and am currently unmatched (Round 5). While I prefer D, E, and A, none of them have applied, and B is actively applying with a strong message of commitment, suggesting they have exhausted their higher preferences. Given the risk of being left unmatched if I hold out too long for higher-ranked students who view School_C as their 3rd or 5th choice, securing Student_B (Rank 4) is a prudent move to fulfill the quota. I will accept this application."
