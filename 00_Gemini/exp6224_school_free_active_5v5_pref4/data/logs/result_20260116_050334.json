Given the rejection history with School_A, I should move to my next highest preference on the active list, which is School_B (Rank 3).\nSchool_B is a highly favorable target because it ranks Student_A 2nd on its priority list (behind Student_D). If Student_D has matched elsewhere (likely School_D, their top choice), or if School_B hasn't received a better application yet, I have a high chance of being accepted.\nTherefore, I will send a formal [APPLY] message to School_B, emphasizing commitment and fit, to secure this match."

Waiting for Student_D carries the risk of losing both Student_A and potentially Student_D if they match elsewhere (e.g., School_D).
