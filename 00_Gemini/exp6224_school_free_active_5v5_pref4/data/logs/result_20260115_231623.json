However, since we are in Round 8 and all other schools (A, B, D, E) are implied to be matched, School_C must have failed to secure any of the students they rank higher than me (Student_D, E, A, B). Since I am the only remaining viable option for School_C to fill their quota, they are highly incentivized to accept me now, even though I am their lowest preference. I must apply aggressively for the third time, emphasizing the finality of the process and guaranteeing immediate acceptance."

I have rejected Student_C twice previously, holding out for a higher priority student. It is now Round 8, and Student_C is applying for the third time, claiming the market is 'critically narrowed' and other schools have finalized quotas. While Student_C is P5, accepting them guarantees a match (Quota 1 fulfilled), preventing the risk of remaining unmatched if P1-P4 students have already secured placements elsewhere. Given the advanced stage of the matching process and the lack of applications from higher priority students (D, E, A, B) in this round, the risk of waiting further outweighs the benefit. Accepting P5 is better than failing to match."
