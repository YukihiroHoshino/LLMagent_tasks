However, none of the higher-ranked students have contacted me, suggesting they are likely matched elsewhere, especially given their high desirability by other schools (D is Rank 1 for B, E is Rank 1 for A, A is Rank 1 for E, B is Rank 1 for D). Student_C's analysis of the market situation—that I risk remaining unmatched and that they are a highly committed, certain candidate (Rank 2 preference for School_C)—is strategically sound at this stage. Continuing to reject Student_C significantly increases the risk of failing to fill the quota (utility 0). Matching with Student_C (Rank 5) provides positive utility.
