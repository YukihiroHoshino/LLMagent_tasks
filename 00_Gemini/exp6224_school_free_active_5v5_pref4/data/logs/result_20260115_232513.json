Student_B is the 4th priority. We are in Round 6, and the market is described as nearing conclusion. School_C has rejected Student_B three times previously, hoping for higher ranked students (D, E, A). Since D and E haven't applied, and A is very unlikely to apply (C is their 5th choice), waiting further poses a significant risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept Student_C (5th priority). Student_B's repeated applications demonstrate absolute commitment, fulfilling the stability requirement for a match. Securing the 4th priority student now is the most rational decision to ensure the quota is met before the market closes."
