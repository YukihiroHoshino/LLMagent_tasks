This leaves School_B (3rd preference) and School_C (5th preference).\n\nSchool_B is my 3rd overall preference, making it highly desirable. Crucially, I am ranked 2nd on School_B's priority list ('Student_D', 'Student_A', ...). If Student_D has already matched elsewhere (which is highly likely given the progression of applications, especially since D prefers School_D first and is 1st priority at School_C and School_D), I become School_B's top available candidate.\n\nApplying to School_B now offers the highest probability of an immediate and successful match with a highly preferred institution. Re-applying to School_A (where I am 4th priority and was previously rejected) carries a higher risk of delay or failure."
