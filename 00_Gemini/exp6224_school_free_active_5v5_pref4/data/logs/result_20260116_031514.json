Student_B is now applying for the fourth time, claiming the market is concluding and I am the 'sole available institution.' This strongly suggests that Student_B has exhausted their higher preferences (School_E, A, B, D) and that my higher priority students (D, E, A) are likely matched elsewhere, given their desirability by other high-ranking schools. Since Student_B is the highest available candidate actively applying, and securing a match (P4) is far better than risking going unmatched or settling for Student_C (P5), it is prudent to accept this application now.
