I must press the case one final time, emphasizing the market dynamics and the risk to School_A of remaining unmatched if they continue to adhere strictly to theoretical rankings when the higher-ranked students are gone. If this fails, I will immediately pivot to School_C in the next round, where I am P4 on their priority list."

Given that School_A is a low preference for E, C, and D, and Student_A was previously rejected, it is highly likely they have secured matches at their higher-preference schools (e.g., School_D). Student_B is highly committed and represents a guaranteed match, ensuring my capacity is utilized before the market closes. Rejecting Student_B again poses a significant risk of ending up with an unfilled quota.
