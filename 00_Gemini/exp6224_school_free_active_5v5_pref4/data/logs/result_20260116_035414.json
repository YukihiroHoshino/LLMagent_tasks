Although School_C has rejected me twice (likely holding out for higher priority students D or E), they must now prioritize matching over remaining unmatched, as I am the highest ranked student left on their list (even though I am their lowest priority overall).

Student_C is my 5th and lowest priority. Although Student_C has shown high commitment (2nd choice) and is applying aggressively, accepting them now (in Round 4) would exhaust my single quota, preventing me from securing a match with any of my top four preferred students (D, E, A, B), who might still become available as the market clears. Since I have rejected Student_C twice already based on the same prioritization logic, I must reject them again to maximize my potential outcome, despite the risk of ending up unmatched.

They are clearly holding out hope for a better candidate or prefer remaining unmatched.\nHowever, since they are the only school left, they are under immense pressure to fill their quota. My strategy is to apply one last time, emphasizing the mutual necessity of this match and the fact that I am highly ranked on my list (Rank 2) and ready to commit immediately.

If this assessment is accurate, my top 4 students (D, E, A, B) are likely matched elsewhere, leaving Student_C as the only available candidate. While Student_C is my last preference, securing a guaranteed match (Rank 5) is superior to risking remaining unmatched (Rank 6/Unfilled).
