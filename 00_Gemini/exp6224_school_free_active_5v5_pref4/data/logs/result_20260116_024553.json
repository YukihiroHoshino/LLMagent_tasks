School_D's priority list suggests they will likely accept Student_D, rejecting A and E. \n\nCrucially, Student_E (my 3rd priority) ranks School_E as their 2nd choice. If rejected by School_D, Student_E is highly likely to apply to School_E in the next round. Since Student_B is ranked low for me, rejecting them now to wait for Student_E is the optimal strategy.
