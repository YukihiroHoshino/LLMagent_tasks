School_C is the only school remaining unmatched, according to the current situation. I previously applied to School_C and was rejected (Round 4). However, since School_C is still available (Capacity 1), it implies they have failed to secure a match with higher priority students (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A). School_C ranks me 4th (Student_B). If D, E, and A are matched elsewhere, I am now the highest available candidate for School_C.

Accepting Student_B now would close the market prematurely for School_C, foregoing the possibility of a P1, P2, or P3 match. Therefore, I will maintain my strategic position and reject Student_B."

My strategy is to highlight the current state of the market: all students they preferred (D, E, A) are gone, and accepting me guarantees they fill their quota, which is better than remaining empty.

Student_B's message strongly suggests that all higher-ranked students (D, E, A) have matched elsewhere, and they are now the highest available candidate. Since I have only one quota slot and the process is progressing, the risk of remaining unmatched or being forced to accept my lowest priority (Student_C, who I've already rejected) is high if I wait further. Accepting Student_B secures a match at rank 4, which is a satisfactory outcome given the likely depletion of higher-ranked candidates. I will accept Student_B."
