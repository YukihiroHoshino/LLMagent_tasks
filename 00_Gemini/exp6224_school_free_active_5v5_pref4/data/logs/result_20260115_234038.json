Student_B's third application, explicitly stating that School_C is their 'final opportunity' and that they are ready to commit immediately, strongly suggests that all higher priority schools (E, A, B, D) have either rejected Student_B or are matched. Given that we are in Round 6 and the higher priority students (D, E, A) rank School_C relatively low (3rd, 3rd, and 5th respectively), the probability of securing one of them decreases with each round, especially since they are likely pursuing School_D, School_E, or School_A. Accepting Student_B now secures a guaranteed match above the lowest priority student (Student_C, P5) and eliminates the risk of remaining unmatched or being forced to accept Student_C later. Therefore, securing Student_B (P4) is the best strategic move under these circumstances."
