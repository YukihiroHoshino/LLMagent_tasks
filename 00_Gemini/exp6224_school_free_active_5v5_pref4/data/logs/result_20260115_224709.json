Student_C has been aggressively applying to School_C (4 times) and has been rejected every time, likely because School_C had higher priority applicants (D, E, A, B) or was holding out. Given that all other schools (A, B, D, E) are assumed to be matched, it is highly probable that all other students (D, E, A, B) are also matched, leaving Student_C as the only remaining student applicant. In this scenario, School_C, to fill its capacity, should accept Student_C, despite C being their lowest priority.

Student_C has applied repeatedly and has been rejected every time. Although Student_C claims the market has shifted and I am the only remaining institution, accepting my lowest priority student now (Round 5) means foregoing the chance to match with Student_D, E, A, or B, all of whom are higher on my list. Since the simulation allows many more rounds (up to 30), and I have not yet received applications from my top 4 choices, I must continue to hold out for a better match.
