Although School_C previously rejected me in Round 7, the market has cleared significantly. School_C's priority list is ['Student_D', 'Student_E', 'Student_A', 'Student_B', 'Student_C']. Since schools A, B, D, and E are matched, it is highly probable that Student_D, Student_E, and Student_A (who rank higher than me at School_C) have secured placements elsewhere. This makes Student_B the highest priority candidate currently available to School_C. I must re-apply immediately and emphasize this strategic advantage to secure a match with my only remaining preferred option."

Student_B (P4) is reapplying and asserts that P1, P2, and P3 have secured matches elsewhere, making them the highest available candidate remaining. Given that we are in Round 8 and I must secure a match, accepting P4 (Student_B) is the optimal strategy if the higher-ranked students are indeed gone.
