We have an extremely long history, including multiple explicit, binding agreements and confirmations that my enrollment is finalized (most recently in Round 25/27). In Round 27, School_A confirmed they successfully dispatched the final administrative packet. The next logical step is to confirm receipt of this packet and reiterate that I am completing the final administrative steps, thereby reinforcing the secured and binding match status without unnecessarily resorting to a competitive [APPLY] tag, which might restart the negotiation cycle we just completed."

Given the extremely protracted negotiation history, multiple binding acceptances (R6, R20, R25), and the late stage of the process (Round 28), it is imperative to confirm that this final administrative completion definitively secures the match. Although higher priority candidates (P1, P2, P3) were preferred, they have not successfully secured the quota. Securing Student_A (P4) is the best available option to fill the quota. Since the student used [TALK], the response must also be [TALK], emphasizing the finality and secured nature of the enrollment."
