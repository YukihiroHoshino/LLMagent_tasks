Given that all other high schools in the market are now matched, School_B is my final opportunity for placement. By accepting this application, you immediately finalize your enrollment capacity with a committed student. I formally apply, confirming my immediate acceptance if offered.",
              "thought": "School_B is the only remaining unmatched school. Although it is my lowest preference (Rank 5), it is the only viable option left, as Schools D, C, E, and A are all matched (inferred from the history and the list of unmatched schools). I have applied three times previously and been rejected, indicating School_B highly prefers other candidates (D, A, B) who must still be available or who School_B is waiting on. Since this is Round 6 and the market is closing, I must make a final, forceful application, emphasizing that School_B secures a match immediately by accepting me, as I have no other options remaining."

We have finalized our internal review and are impressed by the alignment of your goals with our institution's mission. We are pleased to extend an offer of enrollment based on your definitive application. We [ACCEPT] your commitment immediately, finalizing our match.",
              "thought": "School_B's priority list places Student_C at the 4th position (P4: ['Student_D', 'Student_A', 'Student_B', 'Student_C', 'Student_E']). I have 1 quota remaining. Student_C has repeatedly applied, demonstrating extreme commitment, and now claims that all other high schools are matched, making School_B their final option. If this market assessment is accurate, rejecting Student_C risks being left with only Student_E (P5) or no match at all, as higher priorities (D, A, B) are likely matched elsewhere. Since Student_C is an acceptable priority (P4) and guarantees immediate commitment, it is strategically sound to secure this match now rather than risk being left unfilled or forced to take the lowest priority candidate (Student_E). I will accept Student_C."
