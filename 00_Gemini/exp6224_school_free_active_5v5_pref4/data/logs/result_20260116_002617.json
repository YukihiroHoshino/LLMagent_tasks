It is only Round 5, and I still have my full quota (1). Accepting Student_C now would lock me out of matching with any higher-ranked student. Although Student_C is highly persistent and ranks me as their second choice, I must continue to reserve my slot for higher priority candidates. I have rejected them twice before, and I will reject them again now."

All other schools (D, E, A, B) are presumed matched, as School_C is the only school listed as unmatched. Although School_C has rejected me three times previously (likely waiting for higher-priority students D, E, A, B), the market must be near its end. If School_C has not matched anyone by Round 6, it means all four students ranked higher than me on their priority list have matched elsewhere or rejected School_C. This is the optimal time to press for an acceptance, leveraging the fact that they risk remaining unmatched if they continue to wait. I must formally [APPLY] and emphasize immediate commitment."

However, Student_C is the only student applying this round, and I have rejected them repeatedly in previous rounds while holding out for higher priority students (D, E, A, B). Given that we are now in Round 6 and I remain unmatched, the probability of securing one of the top four students who have higher preferences elsewhere is extremely low. Remaining unmatched is worse than accepting the lowest acceptable student on my list. Student_C has shown unwavering commitment (School_C is their Rank 2 choice). Therefore, to secure a match and fill my quota before the market closes, I must accept Student_C."
