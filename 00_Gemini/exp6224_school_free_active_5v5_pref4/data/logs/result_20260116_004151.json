School_C is my P5, the lowest choice, but matching is preferred over remaining unmatched. I was previously rejected by School_C. Given that all other schools (A, B, D, E) appear to be matched, and School_C still has capacity (1), I must reapply. According to School_C's priority list, I (Student_B) am ranked 4th. If the three students ranked above me (D, E, A) are all matched elsewhere (which is implied by the closure of A, B, D, E), I should now be the highest priority available candidate for School_C.
