The goal is to match the highest possible student, but avoiding an unfilled quota is paramount. The absence of applications from higher priority students (D, E, A, B) by Round 5, combined with Student_C's assertion that the market is closing ('all other schools have matched'), strongly suggests that D, E, A, and B have secured matches elsewhere (likely their preferred schools, D and E, which rank C lower). Continuing to wait risks failing to fill the quota entirely.
