Now, only Student_B (Rank 5) is applying for the sixth time, demonstrating extreme commitment. While Student_A (Rank 4) is theoretically preferred, they are not currently applying, suggesting they may be matched or pursuing other options. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched entirely if I reject Student_B at this late stage, securing a dedicated student to fulfill the quota is the most strategically sound decision, even if they are my lowest priority. I will accept Student_B."
