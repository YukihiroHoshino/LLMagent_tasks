This makes School_A a highly probable match, especially since their P1 (Student_E) is likely matched elsewhere (School_E is not active).\nTherefore, applying to School_A now provides the best strategic outcome: securing a stable match at Rank 4, which is better than risking a third rejection from School_C while higher priority students secure their positions."
