This presents an excellent opportunity to secure a match high on my preference list (Rank 4).\n4. School_B (Rank 5) is available, but is my lowest preference.\n\nStrategy: Target School_A immediately with a formal application ([APPLY]), leveraging my high priority ranking there to secure a stable match (Rank 4) before School_A potentially matches its #1 choice (Student_E) or before other students apply and complicate the process."
