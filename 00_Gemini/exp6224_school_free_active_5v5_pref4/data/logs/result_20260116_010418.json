I have an extensive history with School_B where they repeatedly accepted my application, acknowledging me as P2 on their priority list. The very last interaction resulted in an ambiguous '[TALK]' response due to a parsing error, indicating the match was not secured despite mutual intent. I must immediately re-apply to School_B to finalize the agreement, leveraging the strong history of acceptance and my high standing on their priority list, before they potentially match with Student_B (P3) or someone else."

We accept your application, securing this match immediately and concluding the negotiation process. Welcome to School_B.",

Student_A (P2) is applying for the final time and requesting definitive confirmation. Student_D (P1) is not currently applying, and given the late round (R13), waiting is too risky. Student_A is the highest ranked active candidate. I have a history of accepting Student_A, and I must finalize the match now to secure my P2 candidate. I will ACCEPT Student_A."

As the matching process nears its conclusion in Round 13, I wish to affirm that School_C is now my absolute highest available preference.

I have applied to School_B nine times consecutively (Rounds 4-12) and been rejected every time, with School_B consistently citing the need to prioritize Student A (P2) who is applying simultaneously. It is highly unlikely that School_B will accept me while Student A remains active and applying. Given that we are in Round 13 and School_C is my final preference, securing this match is critical to avoid remaining unmatched. School_C's priority list places me at P4 (after D, E, A). Since D, E, and A are highly likely matched elsewhere or focusing on higher preferences, I should now be the highest available student for School_C. I will apply to School_C with full commitment."

It is Round 13, and I have rejected Student_B previously. While I prefer Students D, E, or A, the matching process is nearing completion. There is significant risk that D, E, and A have already been matched by their higher preferences (School_D, School_A, School_B, School_E). Student_B is highly committed at this stage and guarantees a match, securing a moderate utility outcome (Rank 4). Holding out longer for higher-ranked students carries the severe risk of ending up unmatched entirely, or only having Student_C (Rank 5) apply later. Given the late round, securing the match with Student_B is the optimal strategic choice to fulfill the quota."
