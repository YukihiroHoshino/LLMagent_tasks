As we enter Round 7, I want to confirm that School C remains my absolute second preference overall, and unequivocally the highest school available on my list.

My goal is to match with the highest possible school on my preference list: ['School_D', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B'].\nSchool D, E, and B are likely matched, leaving School C (Rank 2) and School A (Rank 4) available.\nSchool C is my highest available preference. Although School C has rejected me four times (due to my low priority ranking of 5th), it is Round 7, and their top four priority students (D, E, A, B) may have matched elsewhere or remain uncommitted.\nSchool A is a near-certain match (I was accepted twice in the past history and I am their 2nd priority), but matching with A now would preclude matching with the preferred School C.\nTherefore, I must prioritize School C one last time before securing the guaranteed match with School A."

We recognize that School C remains your highest current preference and second choice overall.

Student_C is my lowest priority (P5). I have rejected Student_C four times already (Rounds 3-6). It is now Round 7, a relatively late stage in the matching process. My top four candidates (D, E, A, B) are highly sought after and have not applied or have been previously rejected (B). It is highly probable they have secured matches elsewhere. Student_C is highly committed (P2 preference for me) and guarantees a match. Given the increasing risk of remaining unmatched if I hold out further, and the low probability of attracting a higher-ranked student at this late stage, securing a guaranteed match, even P5, is strategically sound now. I will accept Student_C."
