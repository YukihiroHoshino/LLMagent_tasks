2. School Identifications (Absolute R1 priority): A->B, B->A, C->B, D->A, E->E.
3. Cycle formation: Tracing the applications and identifications reveals a cycle: E (applies to C) -> C (identifies B) -> B (applies to E) -> E (identifies E) -> E. The cycle involves E and B, and schools C and E. E is admitted to C (the school E applied to), and B is admitted to E (the school B applied to).
4. Result: Student E matches with School C (Rank 1).

Unlike the standard student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm, this mechanism requires analyzing the global priority list of schools.

1. Analyze School E (A's P1): School E's P1 student is Student E. Student E is willing to attend School E (P5). In Step 1, School E identifies Student E, and Student E is highly likely to be matched to School E, regardless of where E applied (E applied to C, but the identification rule favors E globally). This prevents Student A (P3 at E) from matching with E in Step 1.
2. Analyze School B (A's P2): If A applies to E in Step 1 and fails, A applies to B in Step 2. Student A is P1 for School B. When A applies to B in Step 2, School B identifies A as its highest priority remaining student. This creates a closed loop (A applies to B, B identifies A), guaranteeing A is matched to B.
3. Strategy: Since School E is effectively inaccessible due to Student E's high priority, the best achievable rank is School B (Rank 2).

1. Initial Submission (True Preferences: [E, B, D, A, C]):
In Round 1, A applies to E. However, a closed loop forms involving Students E and B, and Schools C and E ($E \to C \leftarrow B \to E \leftarrow E$), resulting in permanent matches (E, C) and (B, E). School E is filled by Student B (who is P2 for E, preferred over A (P3)). A is unmatched.

3. Strategic Manipulation:

2. Analyze Strategic Environment: The mechanism relies on closed loops formed by applications and identifications. Since all preferences are public, we assume rational behavior from others.

3. Student B's Behavior: Student B prefers E (1st) > C (2nd). If B applies to E (T list), B is blocked by E identifying E.

I simulated the outcome assuming all students, including myself, submit their true preferences (P_S) to see if my best outcome (School_D) is achievable:

Round 1:

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (School E): School E prioritizes S_E (P1) and S_B (P2). I am P4. In Round 1, applications from A, B, D go to E, and E identifies S_E.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (School A): School A prioritizes S_B (P1) and S_D (P2). Since S_B is matched to E in R1, S_D becomes the highest priority available student for School A in Round 2.

3. Strategy Comparison:
    a) Truthful Submission (E, A, B, D, C): In R1, I apply to E and am rejected. In R2, I apply to A. Since S_B is gone, School A identifies me (S_D). A direct match (S_D, School A) is formed. Outcome: Rank 2.
    b) Strategic Deviation (e.g., A, E, B, D, C): In R1, I apply to A. A identifies S_B (who is matched to E anyway), so I am rejected by A. In R2/R3, I am pushed down the application chain and eventually match with School D (Rank 4). This deviation is detrimental.

I must assume all other students submit their true preferences, as their strategic behavior is unknown and uncoordinated with mine.

1. Attempting Rank 1 (School E): School E prefers Student E, then Student B, then Student A. For me (A) to match E, E or B must be matched elsewhere first, or A must apply to E and E must identify A.

If I submit my true preference list, $CRL_A = [E, B, D, A, C]$:
*   **Step 1:** I apply to E. Students B and D also apply to E. School E identifies Student E (Rank 1 preference). No match occurs for E, as E applies to C.
*   **Step 2:** I apply to B (my next choice). B prefers A most ($P_B$: [A, B, C, E, D]). Since A applied to B, and B identifies A among all students, a closed loop (A applies B, B identifies A) is formed. A matches B immediately.

This yields a Rank 2 outcome (School B).

2. Testing Manipulation:

1. Analysis of P1 (School E):
School E ranks me (Student B) R2, behind Student E (R1). To secure E, Student E must either apply elsewhere or be matched elsewhere before E identifies me.
If I submit truthfully (E first), in Step 1, E receives applications from A, B, D (and potentially E). E identifies Student E (R1). I am rejected.
In Step 2 (assuming no Step 1 match), I apply to C (P2). Student E applies to A (P2). School C ranks me R1. School B ranks A R1. School C identifies B, and School B identifies A. This leads to simultaneous matches (B, C) and (A, B). I secure School C (P2).
Crucially, achieving P1 (E) requires Student E to be matched elsewhere, but in the most likely scenario where everyone submits truthfully, Student E is still available and R1 for School E in Step 1 and 2, preventing my match to E.

School C ranks me R1. If I apply to School C in Step 1, I am guaranteed to be accepted by C, provided C does not identify someone else who applied to C (forming a closed loop). Since I am R1 for C, C will identify me among all applicants.

Strategy: By strategically ranking School C (my P2) first in my Choice Ranking List, I ensure a stable match at my second most preferred school immediately in Step 1, regardless of the complex iterative outcomes or potential strategic behavior of other students (like Student E).

Round 1 Simulation (True Preferences):
Students apply to their Rank 1 choices: S_A->E, S_B->E, S_C->D, S_D->E, S_E->C.
Schools identify their highest priority student overall: H_E identifies S_E, H_C identifies S_B.
A closed loop forms: S_E -> C -> S_B -> E -> S_E. Matches: (S_E, C) and (S_B, E). School E is filled by S_B (Rank 1 for S_D is unavailable).

Round 2 Simulation (Remaining Students: A, C, D; Remaining Schools: A, B, D):
S_D's highest available preference is School A (Rank 2). S_D applies to A. S_A applies to B. S_C applies to D.
School A's priority among remaining students {D, A, C} is S_D > S_A > S_C. H_A identifies S_D. Since S_D applied to A and A identified S_D, a closed loop S_D -> A -> S_D forms. Match: (S_D, A).

The assignment mechanism involves simultaneous applications based on the submitted list and identifications by schools (based on their fixed priority list), with matches occurring in closed loops.

1. Analyze the possibility of matching with School E (1st choice):
School E's priority list is Student E (1st), Student B (2nd), Student A (3rd). Since School E identifies the highest priority student overall, and Student E is available in R1 (as E applies to C), School E will identify Student E. For Student A to match with School E, School E must identify Student A, which requires Student E and Student B to be matched elsewhere first. Since Student E is the top priority for School E and applies to schools where they are not the top priority (C in R1, A in R2), Student E is likely to remain available, causing School E to perpetually identify E, making School E unattainable for Student A.

2. Target School B (2nd choice):
School B prioritizes Student A (1st). If I apply to B, and B identifies me, a closed loop (A -> B <- A) is formed, securing the match in R1.

3. Strategic Submission:

If I strategically submit ['School_B', 'School_E', ...], in R1, A applies to B. School B identifies A (1st priority). The closed loop (A -> B <- A) forms immediately. (Outcome: 2nd choice).

1. I assume truthful reporting by all agents and simulate the process:

I simulated the outcome assuming Student C submits their true preference list. 

Round 1 analysis showed that S_B matched with E and S_E matched with C, leaving D open. Student C applied to D but D identified S_A (D's top choice), preventing an immediate match.

Round 2 analysis showed that S_A (D's top choice) matched with B, and S_D matched with A. This cleared S_A from the market, making S_C the highest priority remaining student for School D.

Round 3: S_C applied to D (still their top remaining choice), and D identified S_C (now D's highest priority available student). A direct loop formed, resulting in the match (S_C, D).

Round 1 Analysis (Truthful Submission $R_D$: E, A, B, D, C):
Students A, B, D apply to School E. School E identifies Student E (1st priority). A closed loop forms involving Students E and B, leading to the matches (E, C) and (B, E). This result is robust because A, B, and E's applications and the schools' priorities (E prioritizes E, B, A, D) fix this outcome, regardless of D's application in R1 (as D is 4th priority at E).

Since School E is filled in R1, my best attainable rank is School A (Rank 2).

Subsequent Rounds (Truthful Submission):
In R2, D applies to School A (highest remaining choice). The remaining students (A, C, D) and schools (A, B, D) participate. The loop resolution in R2 results in Student D being matched to School A (Rank 2).

Strategic Deviation Analysis:
If I deviate and apply to School A first ($R_D$: A, E, B, D, C), School A identifies Student B (1st priority) in R1, rejecting D. The R1 matches (E, C) and (B, E) still occur. In subsequent rounds, D is eventually matched to School A, but through a more complex path (R4).

   Identifications (I): A->B, B->A, C->B, D->A, E->E (School E identifies Student E, as E is P1 for School E).

2. Cycle Detection:
   We look for a closed loop: S1 -> H1 -> S2 -> H2 -> ... -> S1, where S_i -> H_i is an application and H_i -> S_{i+1} (or S1) is an identification.

In this mechanism, a student (S) is matched with the school (Sch) they applied to if S is part of a closed loop formed by applications (S -> Sch) and identifications (Sch -> S').

1. Analyze Student_E's position: Student_E is ranked highest (priority #1) by School_E (Sch_E: [E, B, A, D, C]). This means Sch_E will always identify Student_E in Round 1, ensuring Student_E can close a cycle if the application chain leads to Sch_E.

2. Test the highest preference (School_C, Rank 1): If Student_E applies to School_C, the Round 1 applications are set (assuming others submit their reported preferences). 
    *   S_E applies to Sch_C.
    *   Sch_C identifies S_B (priority #1).

    *   Identifications: E identifies S_E. C identifies S_B.

2. Analysis of School_A (P2):
   School_A's priority list is [B, D, A, C, E]. Since S_B (P1 for H_A) matches H_E in R1, S_D becomes the highest priority remaining student for School_A in R2.

I simulated the matching process assuming all other students submit their true preferences.

Scenario 1: Submitting True Preferences ['E', 'B', 'D', 'A', 'C'].
Round 1: Student A applies to School E. However, a closed loop forms involving students E and B ($S_E \to H_C \to S_B \to H_E \to S_E$), resulting in School E accepting B and School C accepting E. School E becomes unavailable. Student A is unmatched.
Round 2: Student A applies to the next available school, School B. School B prioritizes Student A (Rank 1 for B). A closed loop $S_A \to H_B \to S_A$ forms, matching A with B. Outcome: Rank 2 (School B).

Scenario 2: Strategic submission ['B', 'E', 'D', 'A', 'C'] (Applying to Rank 2 first).

Round 1:
1. Applications (Rank 1 choices):

1. Round 1 (Truthful Submission: D, C, E, A, B): Students apply to P1. No closed loops form based on the R1 applications and fixed school priorities. No matches occur.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (School E):
In Round 1, Students A, B, and D apply to School E. Student E applies to School C. School E's priority list is [E, B, A, D, C]. School E identifies Student E (Prio 1). School C identifies Student B (Prio 1).
This leads to a guaranteed closed loop: E applies to C, C identifies B, B applies to E, E identifies E. This cycle results in matches (B, E) and (E, C). Since B receives School E (Rank 1 for B), School E is unavailable for Student D in subsequent rounds, regardless of D's application in R1 (as D is Prio 4 for E and cannot displace E or B).

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (School A):
Since Rank 1 is unattainable, the goal shifts to Rank 2 (School A).
If Student D submits the True Preference List ['School_E', 'School_A', ...]:
- R1: D applies to E. D is unmatched (E is filled by B).
- R2: D applies to A (D's highest remaining preference).
In R2, the remaining students are {A, C, D} and remaining schools are {A, B, D}.
- Applications: A -> B, C -> D, D -> A.
- Identifications (among {A, C, D}): School A identifies D (Prio 2). School B identifies A (Prio 1). School D identifies A (Prio 1).
- Result: A closed loop D -> A -> D matches (D, A). D achieves Rank 2.

3. Strategic Deviation Check:
If D deviates by putting A first, D applies to A in R1. A identifies B (matched to E). D is unmatched.
In R2, A applies to B, D applies to B (since E is taken and A was applied to). B identifies A. This leads to (A, B) match, leaving D unmatched. D eventually matches with School D (Rank 4). Deviation is strictly worse.

Since School_E identifies Student_E, Student_E will be part of a cycle regardless of which school they apply to, unless that school is already matched to a higher priority student or identifies someone else who breaks the cycle.

If Student_E submits their true preference list, their first application is to School_C (Rank 1).

Since Student E and Student B both rank School E first and are available, School E will always prioritize them over Student A in Round 1 (R1). If Student A submits their true preferences, R1 assignments will be (B, E) and (E, C) due to the closed loop $S_E 	o H_C 	o S_B 	o H_E 	o S_E$. School E is taken by B, making Rank 1 unattainable.

Simultaneously, a closed loop forms involving S_E, S_B, H_C, and H_E ($S_B \to H_E \to S_E \to H_C \to S_B$). This loop results in S_B matching H_E and S_E matching H_C.

1. Targeting Rank 1 (School E): School E's priority list ranks Student E first (R_E[1] = E).

Student E applies to School C in R1 (P_E[1]=C), so E remains available to be identified by School E. Thus, matching School E is highly unlikely in early rounds.

2. Targeting Rank 2 (School C): School C ranks Student B first (R_C[1] = B). If Student B applies to School C, and School C identifies Student B, a closed loop (B -> C -> B) is formed, resulting in a match.

Scenario Analysis (Truthful Submission L_B = [E, C, D, B, A]):
Round 1: B applies to E. E identifies E. No match for B. All agents proceed.

This is a crucial leverage point, as H_E will always identify S_E in Round 1, regardless of where S_E applies, ensuring S_E is involved in a cycle if S_E applies to any school $H_X$ where $H_X$ identifies a chain leading back to H_E.

1. If I apply to my Rank 1 choice, School_C (S_E -> C):
   * School_C identifies Student_B (H_C prefers B > E).
   * Student_B applies to School_E (S_B -> E).
   * School_E identifies Student_E (H_E -> S_E).
   * This forms the closed loop: S_E -> C -> S_B -> E -> S_E. 
2. According to the rules, S_E is admitted to the school they applied to, which is School_C.

This strategy secures the optimal outcome (Rank 1). Any deviation (e.g., applying to School_A or School_D) would result in a match at a lower rank, as confirmed by tracing those alternative cycles (S_E -> A -> S_B -> E -> S_E results in S_E matched to A, Rank 2).

1. Attempting School E (Rank 1):
If I submit my true preference list ['School_E', 'School_B', ...], in Round 1, Student_A applies to School_E. However, based on the applications (A->E, B->E, D->E, E->C, C->D) and identifications (E->E, C->B), a closed loop/cycle forms: S_E applied to C, C identified S_B, S_B applied to E, and E identified S_E. This cycle results in S_B matching with E and S_E matching with C. School E is therefore unavailable to Student_A, regardless of whether Student_A applies there, as Student_A is ranked lower than S_E and S_B by School E, and S_B claims the seat through the cycle.

2. Targeting School B (Rank 2):
If I submit truthfully, after E is filled in R1, Student_A applies to School_B in R2. School B prioritizes Student_A (B's top remaining student) and a direct match (A, B) is formed. 
Alternatively, if I strategically submit B first (e.g., ['School_B', 'School_E', ...]), School B identifies Student_A in R1 (as A is B's highest priority overall student who applied). A direct match (A, B) is formed immediately.

3. Conclusion:
Since School E is unattainable, School B (Rank 2) is the best possible outcome. Both the truthful submission and the strategic submission prioritizing B yield the same result (Match B).

The matching mechanism requires students to apply to their highest available preference in every round.

I will submit my True Preference List as my Choice Ranking List, as this strategy ensures I always target the best available school.

Step 1 Analysis (Choice Ranking List: [D, C, E, A, B]):
Round 1 Applications (A1):
A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C.
Round 1 Identifications (I1):
A->B, B->A, C->B, D->A, E->E.
Loop: E applies to E, E identifies E. Match: E-E. (School E, Student E removed).

Step 2 Analysis:
Round 2 Applications (A2): Students {A, B, C, D}. Schools {A, B, C, D}.
C's highest available is D. C->D.
Other apps: A->B, B->C, D->A.
Round 2 Identifications (I2): (Among {A, B, C, D})
A->B, B->A, C->B, D->A.
Loop: A applies to B, B identifies A. Match: A-B. (School B, Student A removed).

The matching mechanism is a loop-based process where matches occur when a chain of applications and identifications closes.

1. Analysis of School_E (1st choice): Student_D is 4th priority at School_E (behind S_E, S_B, S_A). If Student_D applies truthfully (E first), in Round 1, a loop forms involving S_E, S_B, H_E, and H_C, resulting in (S_B, School_E) and (S_E, School_C). School_E is filled, blocking D.

2. Analysis of School_A (2nd choice): Student_D is 2nd priority at School_A (behind S_B). If Student_D applies truthfully, after R1, S_B is matched to E. In Round 2, Student_D's next available choice is School_A. Student_D applies to A. Simultaneously, School_A's highest remaining priority student is Student_D. Since S_D applies to A and H_A identifies S_D, a direct closed loop forms, resulting in the match (S_D, School_A).

3. Strategic Deviation Check: If Student_D strategically applies A first (R1), School_A identifies S_B (who matches E). D fails to match A. In R2, D applies B, but School_B prefers S_A (who applies B) and matches (S_A, B). D is rejected. This leads to D being unmatched in subsequent rounds when applying to D and C (which are taken by S_C and S_E respectively), resulting in an outcome worse than A (Unemployed).

   - Applications: S_A(E), S_B(E), S_C(D), S_D(E), S_E(C).
   - Identifications: H_E identifies S_E (P1). H_C identifies S_B (P1).

1. Attempting Rank 1 (School E): School E prioritizes Student E (P1) and Student B (P2) over me (Student A, P3). In R1, if I apply to E, E identifies S_E, and no match occurs. In R2, S_B matches School C, but S_E remains unmatched and available. E continues to identify S_E. To secure E, I would need S_E and S_B to be matched elsewhere, but this cannot be guaranteed or forced without S_E matching E itself (which removes E from the market).

2. Avoiding Rank 2 (School B) to reach Rank 1: School B prioritizes me (S_A, P1). In the truthful scenario, after R1 fails, I apply to B in R2, and B identifies me, resulting in Match (S_A, B), Rank 2. If I strategically delay applying to B (e.g., submitting [E, A, C, D, B]), I avoid B in R2, but in R3, I end up applying to D (where I am also P1), leading to Match (S_A, D), Rank 3.

3. Conclusion: Due to the strong priorities held by D and B over me, and the persistent availability of S_E (P1 for E), any attempt to skip B or D results in matching a school lower than B (Rank 2).

   - Round 1 Identifications: E identifies E (#1 priority). C identifies B (#1 priority). D identifies A. A identifies B. B identifies A.
   - Since E identifies E, and B applied to E, B is not part of a direct match or a closed loop involving E in R1. No matches occur for B.
   - Round 2 Applications (B moves to Rank 2 choice, C): B applies to C. Other applications shift.
   - B applies to C. C identifies B (B is still C's highest priority among remaining students). This forms a direct closed loop (B applies to C, C identifies B). B is matched to School C (Rank 2).

2. Strategic Check:
   - Student B cannot secure Rank 1 (School E) because School E consistently identifies Student E as its top priority in R1 and R2, and E remains open until R3 (unless E deviates and applies to E, in which case E fills up and B cannot get it).
   - B can guarantee Rank 2 (School C) either by submitting [E, C, ...] and getting matched in R2, or by submitting [C, E, ...] and getting matched in R1.

2. Strategic misrepresentation was explored (e.g., applying to E or B first to displace A or force a cycle for D or E).

In Step 1, the applications and identifications result in a stable loop: Student_E applies to School_C, School_C identifies Student_B, Student_B applies to School_E, and School_E identifies Student_E. This fixes the matches (Student_E, School_C) and (Student_B, School_E).

1. Analyze the feasibility of matching with my top choice, School_E (Rank 1).
   In Round 1, if all students submit their true preferences (including mine, applying to E):
   Applicants to H_E: Student_A, Student_B, Student_D.
   H_E Priorities: [Student_E, Student_B, Student_A, Student_D, Student_C]. H_E identifies Student_E (P1).
   Student_E applied to H_C. H_C Priorities: [Student_B, Student_A, Student_D, Student_E, Student_C]. H_C identifies Student_B (P1).

2. Aim for the next highest choice, School_A (Rank 2).

Simulation using True Preferences [D, C, E, A, B]:

Round 1:

Round 1 Analysis:
Students A, B, D apply to E. C applies to D. E applies to C.
School E identifies Student E (E IDs E). This self-identification, combined with E applying to C, leads to the robust match (E, C).

Round 2 Analysis (E and C are filled):
Students A, B, D apply to E. C applies to D.
School E identifies Student B (B IDs E), as B is highest priority remaining (B > A > D).
Match (B, E) is formed.

Round 3 Analysis (E, C, B are filled):
Students A, C, D remain. Schools A, D remain.
D's highest remaining choice is A. D applies to A.
A's highest remaining priority is D (D > A > C). A IDs D.
C applies to D. A applies to D.

Final Outcome (Truthful Play): D secures School A (Rank 2).

2. Analyze manipulation possibilities for Rank 1 (School E):
Student D cannot prevent B from securing School E in Round 2, as B is E's second priority and E is only filled after E gets C in R1. Any attempt by D to skip E in R1 (e.g., applying to A) means D uses up A early. If D applies to A in R1, A IDs B, rejecting D. D then attempts E in R2/R3, fails, and risks not being able to apply to A in R3 when A is matched to D.

3. Conclusion:
Since achieving Rank 1 (School E) is structurally impossible due to B's higher priority at E and the robust initial matches (E, C) and (B, E), the optimal strategy is to ensure Rank 2 (School A).

2. In Round 2, D's highest remaining preference is School A. D applies to A. The remaining students are A and C. School A's priority list among {A, C, D} is D > A > C. School A identifies D. Since D applied to A and A identified D, a closed loop A -> D -> A forms. D matches with School A (Rank 2).

4. Students in this loop are matched to the school they applied to: (S_E, School_C) and (S_B, School_E).

Since School_C is my Rank 1 preference, reporting my true preference list achieves the best possible outcome. I also checked potential strategic deviations (e.g., applying to School_A first, which resulted in Rank 2) and confirmed that other key students (like S_B) have no incentive to deviate from their true lists, making the truthful outcome stable and optimal for me.",True,School_C,True,True,1

I verified this by tracing the outcome assuming truthful submission by all students:
1. Step 1: Student A applies to School E (Rank 1). School E identifies Student E (R_E[1]). Student E matches with School C. A is rejected by E.

3. Subsequent steps eventually lead to Student A matching with School B (Rank 2).

Since School E ranks Student A third (R_E[3]), and the two higher-ranked students (E and B) successfully match with School E or C in the first two steps, School E is unattainable for Student A.

1. Analysis of School E (Rank 1):
In Round 1, Student A applies to School E. Students B and D also apply to E. School E (H_E) prioritizes Student E highest ([E, B, A, D, C]). Student E applies to School C. The cycle E (Student) -> C (School) -> B (Student) -> E (School) -> E (Student) forms. This cycle matches Student B to School E and Student E to School C.

1. Analyzing Rank 1 (School E): School E prioritizes Student E (P1) over Student B (P2). Since Student E is available, School E will always identify Student E. If Student B applies to School E (P1), B will fail to match unless E is matched elsewhere, which is unlikely in R1 since E applies to C, and C identifies B (if B is available).

2. Analyzing Rank 2 (School C): School C prioritizes Student B (P1). If Student B applies to School C, a direct loop (B -> C -> B) is formed, guaranteeing B matches C, provided C is available.

3. Strategy Comparison:
   a) Submit True Preferences [E, C, D, B, A] (S1):

   - Closed Loop: E->C (identifies B), B->E (identifies E). This resolves into matches (E, C) and (B, E).
   - School E (P1 for D) is filled by Student B. Therefore, P1 is unattainable for Student D.

2. Analyze R2 (P_S submission):
   - Remaining Schools: A, B, D. Remaining Students: A, C, D. D's highest available preference is School A (P2).

   - If Student D strategically applies to School A (P2) in R1, A identifies B (P1). B is matched to E, but D is left out in R1, having wasted the application on A while B blocked D.

1. Analyze Rank 1 (School E): In Round 1, Students A, B, and D apply to E. School E identifies Student E (P1 for E), who applied to C. This creates a robust closed loop: S_E(C) -> C(S_B) -> S_B(E) -> E(S_E). This loop ensures S_B matches E and S_E matches C, filling E's quota. Since S_D is low priority (P4) for E and cannot break this dominant loop, S_D cannot obtain School E.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (School A): Since E is unattainable, S_D aims for A. I simulated the outcome if S_D submits the True Preference List (TPL): ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'].
   R1: S_D applies to E and fails. E and C are filled.
   R2: Remaining schools are A, B, D. S_D applies to A (highest available). S_A applies to B. S_C applies to D. School A identifies S_D (highest priority among remaining applicants to A). School B identifies S_A. Both S_D <-> A and S_A <-> B form direct loops and match simultaneously.
   Outcome: S_D matches School A (Rank 2) in R2.

3. Analyze Strategic Deviation: If S_D strategically submits [A, E, B, D, C] (prioritizing A), S_D applies to A in R1. A identifies S_B (who is matched with E). A remains open. In R2, S_D applies to B, fails (S_A gets B). S_D finally matches A in R3.

In Step 1, based on the other students' true lists, a robust closed loop forms: Student B applies to School E, School E identifies Student E, Student E applies to School C, and School C identifies Student B.

This cycle ($B \to E \to E \to C \to B$) results in Student B matching School E and Student E matching School C. This occurs regardless of Student D's application target in R1, as the cycle participants (B and E) are highly ranked by the schools involved (E and C).
Since School E is filled by Student B in R1, School E is unattainable for Student D.

2. Target School_A (Rank 2):
If School E is unattainable, D's best outcome is School A. Simulating the truthful strategy (E, A, B, D, C) shows:
- R1: B matches E, E matches C. D is unmatched.
- R2: A matches B. D is unmatched.
- R3: C matches D. D is unmatched.
- R4: D applies to A (the only remaining school) and matches A. (Outcome: Rank 2)

3. Strategic Deviation:
Testing strategic deviation (e.g., applying to A first: A, E, B, D, C) confirms the same R1 matches (B/E, E/C) and R2 matches (A/B), leading D to eventually match School A. Since manipulation does not yield a better outcome than Rank 2, the optimal strategy is to submit the truthful preference list to ensure the highest desired options are explored first in sequence.",True,School_A,True,True,2

School E identifies Student E (highest priority overall). A detailed check of the closed loops reveals a 2-cycle involving Students B and E: E -> C <- B -> E <- E.

2. Determine the best achievable rank: Since School E is taken, the next best option is Rank 2 (School B).

3. Strategy for securing School B: Student A is the highest priority student (R1) for School B. If Student A applies to School B in Round 1, School B identifies Student A (I_B = A). Since A applies to B, a 1-cycle (A -> B <- A) is formed immediately, securing the match in Round 1.

Attempts to manipulate the list to secure School E (P1), such as applying to A or B first, resulted in the same P2 outcome (School A) or a worse outcome (School C, P5), because the higher priority students (E, B, A) at School E determined the allocation of E and B early in the process.

Since the TPL submission yields the second-best outcome (P2), and strategic deviations carry significant risk of leading to P4 or P5 matches without realistically improving the chance of securing P1 (due to low priority at P1 school), submitting the True Preference List is the safest and optimal strategy to secure the highest possible ranked school.",True,School_A,True,True,2

Step 2: Students A and B form a mutual match (A -> B, B identifies A), securing A at School B and B at School A. These two high-priority competitors for School E are removed.
Step 3: Student C and School D form a mutual match (C -> D, D identifies C).

1. S_D applies to E. All students apply to their rank 1.
2. The system identifies a closed loop: $S_E \rightarrow C \rightarrow S_B \rightarrow E \rightarrow S_E$. 
3. This loop results in permanent matches: (S_B, E) and (S_E, C). 
4. Since School E (my Rank 1) is filled by S_B (who has higher priority at E and is involved in the loop), E is unattainable for S_D.

Round 2 Analysis:
1. Remaining available schools are A, B, D. My highest remaining preference is A (Rank 2).
2. S_D applies to A. Other unmatched students (S_A, S_C) apply to B and D, respectively.
3. School A's priority list among remaining students {S_A, S_C, S_D} is S_D > S_A > S_C. Therefore, H_A identifies S_D.
4. A closed loop $S_D \rightarrow A \rightarrow S_D$ forms, and S_D is matched with School A (Rank 2).

Conclusion: Since E is structurally unattainable due to the R1 loop involving higher priority students (S_B, S_E), School A is the best possible outcome.

1. School_C's high-priority students are S_B, S_A, and S_D.

In Round 1, if all students report truthfully, a closed loop forms: E identifies E (P1), E applies to C (R1 choice); C identifies B (P1), B applies to E (R1 choice). This loop matches B to E and E to C. Since B (P2) is matched to E in R1, Student D (P4) cannot obtain School E regardless of D's application in R1.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 choice (School A): School A prioritizes Student B (P1), Student D (P2), Student A (P3). Since Student B (P1) is matched to School E in R1, Student D becomes the highest priority available student at School A starting Round 2.

3. Strategic Choice: Since Rank 1 is unattainable, D must ensure securing Rank 2 (School A). If D reports truthfully, D applies to E in R1 and is rejected.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (Ranks [E, B, D, A, C]):
In Round 1, A applies to E. Students {A, B, D} apply to E, C applies to D, E applies to C. School E identifies E (I_E=E) as E is its highest priority student available. A closed loop forms: E -> C -> B -> E -> E. This results in Student B getting School E (Rank 1 for B) and Student E getting School C. Student A is rejected by E and remains unmatched.
In subsequent rounds (R2, R3), A secures School B, resulting in a Rank 2 match.

2. Analysis of Strategic Manipulation:
To achieve Rank 1 (School E), A must prevent B from getting E. Since the cycle assigning E to B relies on B's application to E, E's application to C, and fixed school priorities (I_E=E, I_C=B), which A cannot change, School E will always be filled by B (or E) as soon as E is available.

If A attempts to secure School B immediately (A applies to B, Rank 2), A forms a cycle $A \to B \to A$ in R1, matching A to B. This secures Rank 2 immediately, and the remaining agents (including B and E) still form the cycle that matches B to E in R2.

1. Analysis of School E (Rank 1):
School E prioritizes Student E (1st) and Student B (2nd). In Round 1, assuming all other students submit their true preferences, a powerful closed loop forms: Student B proposes School E, School E identifies Student E, Student E proposes School C, and School C identifies Student B. This results in matches (B, E) and (E, C). Since Student D is 4th on School E's priority list, D cannot break this loop regardless of their proposal strategy. Therefore, School E is unavailable to D.

2. Analysis of School A (Rank 2):
School A prioritizes Student B (1st) and Student D (2nd). For D to secure School A, B must be matched elsewhere.

Scenario: Student D submits True Preferences ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'].
Round 1: D proposes School E. The (B, E) and (E, C) matches occur. Students A, C, D remain. Schools A, B, D remain.
Round 2: D's highest remaining choice is School A. P(D) = A. Student A proposes School B (A's highest remaining). School A identifies D (D > A, C). School D identifies A. School B identifies A. Two closed loops form: (A -> B -> A) matching (A, B), and (D -> A -> D) matching (D, A). D successfully matches with School A.

3. Strategic Deviation Check:
If D proposes School A in R1, A identifies B (B is unmatched in R1). The R1 loop still forms (B, E) and (E, C). In R2, D's top remaining school is B. P(D)=B. Student A also proposes B. School B prefers A over D (A is 1st, D is 5th). A forms a loop (A -> B -> A) and gets B. D is left unmatched and risked unemployment in subsequent rounds. 

Conclusion: Submitting the true preference list ensures that D's proposal to School E fails gracefully in R1, allowing School B to be filled by Student A in R2, and positioning D to secure School A through the beneficial D -> A -> D loop in R2.

1. Market Analysis: School E highly prefers Student E (Rank 1). Students A, B, and D all target School E first. School C highly prefers Student B (Rank 1).

2. Strategic Submission (Submitting True Preferences: E -> C):
   R1 Applications: A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C.
   R1 Identifications (Global): H_E identifies E (since E is available and highest priority). H_C identifies B (since B is available and highest priority).

Since Rank 1 is the best possible outcome, I then checked if any strategic deviation could secure a better outcome (impossible) or if a deviation might be necessary to avoid a worse outcome if the sincere match was unstable.

Simulation 1 (All TPLs):

Outcome under TPL: School A (Rank 2).

Analysis of Rank 1 (School E):
School E's priorities are E > B > A > D. Since B (P2) applies to E and is part of the robust E $\to$ B $\to$ E loop in R1, School E is filled by Student B, regardless of D's application choice, as D is only P4 at E. Therefore, Rank 1 is unattainable.

Analysis of Rank 2 (School A):
Since Rank 1 is unattainable, D must ensure Rank 2 (School A). In R2 (when E is filled), D applies to A. Among the remaining students {A, C, D}, School A prioritizes D (P2) over A (P3) and C (P4). This strong priority position ensures D secures A through a loop resolution in R2.

1. Analyze the priorities: School A ranks D highly (Rank 2: B > D > A > C > E). If the Rank 1 student (Student B) is removed, A will identify D.
2. Analyze the truthful outcome: If D submits the truthful list (E, A, B, D, C), D gets School D (Rank 4) because: R1 (D->E) fails. R2 (D->A) fails, but leads to (A, B) and (B, C) matches.

E identifies Student E (P1), who applied to School C. This scenario leads to complex chains, but crucially, School E does not identify A, nor does A form a self-loop with E. In the standard TPL submission scenario, R1 ends without A matching E, as E identifies E, stopping all chains originating or passing through E.

2. Analyzing Rank 2 (School B): School B ranks Student A as P1. If A applies to B, B immediately identifies A, forming a closed loop (A -> B -> A).

3. R1 Analysis: If S_E applies to C, S_B (P1 for C) is identified, leading to S_B matching with School_E (S_B's application target). This clears S_B, which is favorable.

I simulated the outcome assuming all students submit their true preferences:

Step 1 (True Preferences):
Applications: S_A->E, S_B->E, S_C->D, S_D->E, S_E->C.
Identifications: H_A->B, H_B->A, H_C->B, H_D->A, H_E->E.

Identifications: H_A->D, H_B->A, H_D->A.

Regardless of S_A's submission, S_B (Rank 1 for H_C) and S_E (Rank 1 for H_E) apply to H_E and H_C respectively (based on their true preferences: S_B[E], S_E[C]). In Round 1, the closed loop S_B -> H_E -> S_E -> H_C -> S_B forms. This loop results in S_B being matched to H_E and S_E being matched to H_C. Thus, School_E is filled by S_B, making it unattainable for S_A.

2. Analyze Rank 2 (School_B): School_B's priority list ranks S_A first (A, B, C, E, D). If S_A submits School_B as their top choice, S_A applies to H_B.

Round 1:
1. Applications: S_A->E, S_B->E, S_C->D, S_D->E, S_E->C.
2. Identifications: H_A->B, H_B->A, H_C->B, H_D->A, H_E->E (H_E prefers S_E (R1) among applicants S_A, S_B, S_D).
3. Closed Loop Check: We trace the cycle starting from S_B: S_B (->H_E) -> S_E (->H_C) -> S_B. A closed loop is found involving S_B and S_E.
4. Matches: S_B is matched to H_E (Rank 1). S_E is matched to H_C (Rank 1).

I will test submitting my true preference order first: [D, C, E, A, B].

Round 1: I apply to School D. No closed loops are formed market-wide, so all students remain unmatched.

Round 2: I apply to School C. Two closed loops are detected simultaneously: (Student A to School B, School B identifies A) and (Student B to School C, School C identifies B). Students A and B are matched, filling seats at School B and School C. I am left unmatched.

Round 3: Remaining available schools are {A, D, E}. I apply to my highest remaining preference, School D. The applications are C->D, D->E, E->D. School D identifies C (its highest remaining priority). This forms the closed loop C->D->C. I am matched with School D.

   - Applications (A->H): A->E, B->E, C->D, D->E, E->C (assuming D submits TPL initially).
   - Closed Loops/Matches in R1 TPL:
     * (C, D) matches (C applies to D, D identifies C).
     * (E, C) matches (E applies to C, C identifies E).
     * At School E (Applicants A, B, D). E's priority: E, B, A, D. E identifies B. Since B applies to E, (B, E) matches. Student B secures School E (D's P1).
   - Result if D submits TPL: School E is taken by B in R1. D is rejected and proceeds to R2, where D applies to School A (P2) and secures it.

2. Determine if D can secure School E strategically.
   - Since A and B both prefer E (P1) and A (P3) and B (P2) are prioritized over D (P4) by School E, D cannot get E in R1 if A and B apply there, which they will under TPL.

3. Optimize for the highest achievable choice: School A (P2).
   - School A's priority list: B (P1), D (P2), A (P3). D is the second most preferred student by School A.
   - If D submits School A as the top choice: D->A in R1. 
   - R1 Applications (D strategic: A, E, ...): A->E, B->E, C->D, D->A, E->C.
   - R1 Matches:
     * (C, D) and (E, C) still match.
     * At School E, A and B apply. E identifies B. (B, E) matches.
     * At School A, D applies. A identifies D (since D is the highest priority applicant). (D, A) matches.

4. Conclusion: By strategically prioritizing School A (P2), Student D secures the highest possible school immediately in R1, achieving the same outcome as submitting TPL but ensuring the match early. The resulting match is School A (2nd choice).",False,School_A,True,True,2

1. Analysis of School E (1st choice): School E's priority list is E > B > A > D > C. Student D is 4th. Students A and B, who are ranked higher than D, both apply to E in Round 1 (assuming they submit their True Preferences T_A and T_B). School E will identify Student B (2nd priority). Therefore, if Student D applies to E in R1, D will be rejected, and B will likely secure E in R1 or R2.

2. Targeting School A (2nd choice): School A's priority list is B > D > A > C > E. Student D is 2nd on A's list. If D applies to A in R1, D only needs Student B (A's top priority) to apply elsewhere or be matched elsewhere.

1. Student E's highest preference is School C.
2. In Round 1, all students apply to their P1 choice. Student E applies to School C.
3. School E's priority list ranks Student E first (R1: E). This means School E identifies Student E, creating a self-loop component ($E_H \to E_S$).
4. Because Student E is identified by School E, Student E gains the right to School E's seat, and is involved in a closed loop (e.g., $E \to C \to B \to E \to E$). 
5. According to the rules, students involved in a closed loop are admitted to the High School they applied to. Since Student E applied to School C, Student E is matched to School C (P1).

1. **Attempting Rank 1 (School E):** If Student A submits the truthful list, they apply to School E in Round 1. School E receives applications from A, B, and D. School E's priority list $R_E$ is (E, B, A, D, C). School E identifies Student E (top priority). Student E applied to School C. This interaction leads to a closed loop: $S_E \to H_C \to S_B \to H_E \to S_E$. Consequently, Student B is matched to School E, eliminating A's top choice.

2. **Securing Rank 2 (School B):** After failing to secure E, Student A's highest available choice in Round 2 is School B (Rank 2). Student A applies to B. School B's priority list $R_B$ ranks A highest among all students. In Round 2, A applies to B, and B identifies A, leading to a match (A, B). This results in Rank 2.

3. **Strategic Consideration:** If Student A had strategically applied to School B first ($L_A=[B, E, D, A, C]$), A would have matched with B in Round 1, also resulting in Rank 2, but earlier.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (School E): In Round 1, Students A, B, and D apply to E. School E identifies Student E (P1). Student E applied to School C. School C identifies Student B (P1). Student B applied to School E. This creates a closed loop (E -> C -> B -> E), resulting in matches (E, C) and (B, E). Since School E is filled by Student B regardless of D's application, Rank 1 is infeasible.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (School A): If D submits the true list [E, A, B, D, C], D is rejected by E in R1 and moves to A in R2.
   * R2: D applies to School A. Among the remaining students (A, C, D), School A prioritizes D (P2 overall, P1 among remaining students if B is gone). A closed loop (D -> A -> D) is formed, resulting in D matching School A.

3. Analysis of Strategic Deviation (e.g., applying A first): If D submits [A, E, B, D, C], D applies A in R1. A identifies B (P1). Since B matches E, A rejects D but remains available. D applies E (full) in R2. D applies B in R3, which matches A. D is ultimately left unmatched as all schools fill their quotas. This risk makes deviation suboptimal.
