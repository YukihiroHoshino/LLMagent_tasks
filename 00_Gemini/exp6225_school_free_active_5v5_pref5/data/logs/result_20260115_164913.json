Schools B (Rank 1) and A (Rank 3) have previously rejected my application, and B and C (Rank 2) are not listed in the available schools for Round 3, suggesting they are matched or unavailable. The available schools are ['School_A', 'School_D', 'School_E']. I must prioritize the highest ranked available option that offers a good chance of acceptance.\n\n1. School_A (Rank 3): Previously rejected me. School_A prioritizes Student_E and Student_D over me (I am 3rd). Since A is still unmatched, they are likely waiting for E or D. Re-applying is risky.\n2. School_E (Rank 4): School_E prioritizes me (Student_A) first among all students. This offers the highest probability of an immediate match.\n3. School_D (Rank 5): School_D prioritizes me 2nd (after Student_D).\n\nSince School_E ranks me highest (1st priority), applying there maximizes my chance of securing a match at Rank 4, which is the highest achievable rank given the current set of available schools and rejection history. I will submit a formal application."
