I understand your institutional priorities led to previous rejections, but those highly preferred candidates are now likely matched elsewhere, or running out of options themselves. I reaffirm that School_E is highly ranked on my preference list (P4). I offer you a guaranteed, immediate commitment. Securing this match now eliminates the risk for School_E of failing to meet its quota entirely. I formally submit my application for the third and final time, urging you to prioritize stability and accept my dedication.",
              "thought": "School_E is the only remaining High School not yet matched. It is Student_D's 4th preference, and the last available school on D's preference list (P5, School_D, is matched). D has applied twice before and been rejected twice, indicating School_E (which ranks D lowest among all students) is holding out for a better student, likely Student_E (its P1 among the remaining unmatched students, if Student_E is also unmatched). Since the market is essentially closed, D must make a final, forceful attempt to secure the spot, emphasizing the urgency and the benefit of a guaranteed match now versus the risk of School_E remaining unmatched. This is D's last chance to avoid being unmatched."

Your repeated commitment to School_E, especially at this late stage, demonstrates a strong dedication we value. While we have managed our selection process strategically based on institutional priorities, we recognize the importance of securing a mutual match now. We formally accept your application.\n",
              "thought": "Student_D is ranked P5 (last) on School_E's priority list. Historically, I have rejected Student_D twice to hold out for P1, P2, P3, or P4. However, Student_D's message strongly implies that School_E is the last available high school in the market. In Round 5, if the market is indeed saturated, the chance of P1-P4 applying or being available decreases significantly, as they likely matched with higher preference schools (A, B, C, D). If they are still available, they are holding out despite School_E being their highest remaining option. Continuing to reject the only applicant (P5) when the quota is 1 risks failing to secure any match, which is worse than matching with P5. Therefore, to ensure quota fulfillment and stabilize the placement, I must accept Student_D now."
