School_A's top two priorities (Student_E and Student_D) are likely applying to their own #1 choices (School_C and School_B, respectively).\n3.

I have already rejected Student_D (P3) and Student_E (P4) in previous rounds, demonstrating a strong commitment to securing either P1 (Student_B) or P2 (Student_C). Student_C is applying now, indicating School_C is their highest remaining priority. While Student_B (P1) has not yet applied, accepting Student_C secures an excellent outcome (P2) and fulfills the quota. Waiting longer risks losing Student_C to another school (like School_B) without a guarantee that Student_B, who ranks School_C third, will ultimately apply. Given the high priority and the application tag [APPLY], I will secure this match."
