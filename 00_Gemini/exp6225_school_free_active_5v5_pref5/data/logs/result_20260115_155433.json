It is Round 5, and I have not secured a match yet. Student_E has submitted a formal application ([APPLY]) and stated that School_E is currently their highest remaining preference, indicating a high likelihood of accepting the offer and forming a stable match. While Student_A, Student_C, and Student_B are higher priorities, they have not applied, and given their high desirability by other top schools (A, B, C), they are likely matched or pursuing options higher on their own lists. Waiting longer significantly risks ending up with no match or being forced to accept Student_D (who has already been rejected historically). Securing Student_E (rank 4) now is a prudent strategic move to fulfill the quota with a reasonably high-priority candidate."
