This leaves School_A (Rank 3) and School_E (Rank 4) as viable options.\nSchool_A is preferred over School_E.\n\nHistory shows I applied to School_A in Round 2 and was rejected, but School_A remains unmatched. School_A prioritizes Student_E and Student_D ahead of me. If School_A is still unmatched, it strongly suggests that Student_E and Student_D have been matched by the higher-ranked schools (B, C, D) that are now unavailable. This makes me School_A's highest remaining priority candidate.\n\nI will re-apply to School_A. Since I was already rejected once, I need to make a very strong, final appeal, emphasizing commitment and readiness to accept immediately, leveraging the apparent shift in the applicant pool dynamics."
