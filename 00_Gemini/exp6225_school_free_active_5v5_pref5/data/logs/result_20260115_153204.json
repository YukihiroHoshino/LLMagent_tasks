However, Student_E is highly persistent, reapplying in Round 4, and ranks School_D as their highest remaining preference (2nd overall). Student_D and Student_A rank School_D last (5th), making them unlikely targets unless all else fails. Student_C (Rank 3) is a possibility (ranks me 3rd). However, if I reject Student_E again, I risk losing them entirely, especially since School_A ranks Student_E as their #1 priority. Since it is Round 4 and securing a match (even Rank 4) is better than risking an empty quota, I should accept the persistent and highly motivated Student_E now before they match elsewhere. This secures a highly preferred student for the school relative to the available pool."
