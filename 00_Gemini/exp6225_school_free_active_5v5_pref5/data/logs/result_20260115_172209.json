If the two students prioritized above me (Student_E and Student_D) choose to apply to their higher preferences (e.g., School_C or School_B), School_A will accept me immediately.

My top three choices (Student_D, Student_A, Student_C) highly prefer School_B or School_C, and those schools also prioritize them highly.
