Since School_E is still open, it implies that the students School_E preferred over me (Student_A, C, B, E) have either matched elsewhere or have not applied/been accepted yet.\n\nGiven that School_E is the last available option on my preferred list, I must re-apply aggressively. I need to acknowledge the previous rejection but emphasize my continued commitment, hoping the shift in the market makes me a more appealing candidate now (especially if their higher-ranked students are gone)."
