In this round, I received applications from Student_D (Rank 2) and Student_A (Rank 3). Student_D is the most desirable candidate currently applying. While Student_E (Rank 1) is still available, securing Student_D (Rank 2) early is a highly favorable outcome and minimizes risk, especially since Student_E ranks School_A as their 3rd choice. I will accept Student_D to secure a strong match immediately."

School_E is my 4th preference (P4) out of 5, meaning it is still a desirable match, and certainly better than remaining unmatched. Given that all other preferred schools (School_B, School_C, School_A) are implicitly matched elsewhere (as they are not in the 'unmatched' list), School_E represents my last viable option. Furthermore, School_E prioritizes Student_A (P1 on their list). This match is highly probable and necessary. I must use the [APPLY] tag immediately to secure the match."
