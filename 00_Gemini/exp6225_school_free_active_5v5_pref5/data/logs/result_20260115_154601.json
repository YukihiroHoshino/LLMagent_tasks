All schools ranked 1 through 4 have either rejected me (B, C, E) or are unavailable (A, implicitly). The only remaining unmatched school is School_D, which is my 5th and last choice. Since matching with School_D is preferred over remaining unmatched, I must apply.\n\nCrucially, School_D's priority list places Student_D as their #1 choice: ['Student_D', 'Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_E', 'Student_B']. This makes acceptance highly probable.\n\nTherefore, the strategy is to formally apply ([APPLY]) to School_D immediately to secure the match."
