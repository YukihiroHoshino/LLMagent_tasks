All my higher preferences (B, C, E, and implicitly A) appear to be matched or unavailable, as the only remaining school is School_D. School_D is my lowest preference (P5), but it is still on my list. Since the goal is to match with the highest possible school, and School_D is the only remaining option, I must apply to avoid being unmatched. Crucially, School_D ranks me (Student_D) as its number one priority. Given this high priority and the fact that School_D has capacity (it's unmatched), a direct application should result in an immediate acceptance and secure the match."
