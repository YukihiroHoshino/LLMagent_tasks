The highest remaining preference is School_A (Rank 3), followed by School_E (Rank 4).\n\nSchool_A previously rejected Student_A, but since School_A is still unmatched (Capacity 1), it implies that its higher priority students (Student_E and Student_D) have either rejected School_A or matched elsewhere. Student_A is School_A's 3rd priority. Given the narrowing field, School_A should now be highly motivated to accept Student_A.\n\nSchool_E is a guaranteed match (Student_A is School_E's P1), but School_A is ranked higher.
