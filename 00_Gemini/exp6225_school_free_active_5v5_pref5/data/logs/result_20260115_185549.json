All schools except School_D appear to be matched (based on the 'List of high schools not yet matched'). I have been rejected by School_B (Rank 1), School_C (Rank 2), and School_E (Rank 4). School_A (Rank 3) is unavailable. Therefore, School_D (Rank 5) is the only remaining available option on my preference list. Since matching with School_D is preferred over remaining unmatched, I must apply immediately to secure this match.\r\nFurthermore, checking School_D's priority list reveals that I, Student_D, am their top choice. Given this high priority, a direct [APPLY] should result in an immediate acceptance."

Since my quota is 1 and Student_D is my top choice, I must secure this match immediately to maximize my outcome."
