Student_E has submitted an [APPLY] tag in this round, showing strong commitment.\n\nThe students ranked higher than E (A, C, B) are highly sought after by other top schools (A, B, C) and are unlikely to reach me, as School_E is low on their preference lists (4th or 5th choice). Student_E is also highly desired by School_A and School_B (Rank #1 for both), meaning if E is applying to me (4th preference for E), higher options may be closing off.\n\nSince securing A, C, or B is highly improbable, and Student_E is the highest-ranked candidate currently applying, accepting E ensures I fill my quota rather than risking being unmatched.
