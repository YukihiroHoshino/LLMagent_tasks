My objective is to match with the highest possible school on my preference list: ['School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E', 'School_D'].\nI have already been rejected by School_B (P1) and School_C (P2), suggesting they have matched or prioritized other students.\nSchool_A (P3) is not listed as available, so I assume it is matched.\nThe remaining available schools are School_E (P4) and School_D (P5).\nSchool_E is my P4 choice, while School_D is my P5 choice. I must prioritize School_E first.\n\nSchool_E's priority list places Student_D last (P5). This makes acceptance unlikely if higher-ranked students are applying or available.\nSchool_D's priority list places Student_D first (P1). This is a guaranteed match if I apply, serving as a crucial safety net.\n\nSince securing a match is vital, but maximizing preference is the goal, I will try for my P4 (School_E) first, knowing that my P5 (School_D) is available as a guaranteed match in the next round if necessary. I will submit a formal application [APPLY] to School_E, emphasizing its value to me."
