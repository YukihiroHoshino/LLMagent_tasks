All schools ranked 1 through 4 (B, C, A, E) are now unavailable, either because I was rejected or they matched with someone else. School_D (Rank 5) is the only remaining option on my preference list. Since matching with School_D is preferable to remaining unmatched, I must apply now.\nCrucially, School_D lists Student_D as its top priority candidate. Therefore, a formal application ([APPLY]) is highly likely to result in an [ACCEPT] tag and secure the final match."
