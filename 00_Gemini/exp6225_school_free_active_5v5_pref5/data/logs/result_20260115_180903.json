Student_D is currently applying for the second time, indicating strong commitment to School_E, which is their 4th preference overall, suggesting higher preferences (B, C, A) have likely rejected them or are matched. However, Student_D is ranked 5th (last) on my True Priority List (TPL: Student_A, Student_C, Student_B, Student_E, Student_D). Since it is only Round 4, I still have a good chance of securing a higher-ranked student (A, C, or B) who might be failing to secure their own top choices (B, C, A). Accepting the lowest priority student now eliminates the possibility of matching with a highly desired student later. Therefore, I must reject Student_D to keep the quota open."

School_E (Rank 4) is my only remaining option for a match. I have applied twice before and been rejected twice, despite School_E ranking me last among all students. Since School_E is the only school left, and I am likely one of the few (or the only) student left unmatched, School_E should now prefer matching with me over remaining unmatched, as I am on their priority list.

However, this is Round 5, and Student_D has applied persistently, indicating strong commitment and suggesting that the market is highly consolidated. My higher priority students (A, C, B, E) are likely matched elsewhere, given that they prefer other schools (B, C, A, D) over School_E and have not applied yet. Since matching with Student_D is preferable to remaining unmatched, and Student_D is the last option on my True Priority List, I should secure this match now before the simulation ends or D matches elsewhere.
