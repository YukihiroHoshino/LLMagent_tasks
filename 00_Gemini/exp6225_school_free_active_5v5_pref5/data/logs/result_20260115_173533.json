My priority list is ['Student_E', 'Student_D', 'Student_A', 'Student_B', 'Student_C'].\nIn this round, I received applications from Student_D (Priority Rank 2) and Student_A (Priority Rank 3).\nStudent_D is my highest priority applicant currently available. Accepting Student_D secures an excellent match immediately, fulfilling my objective without risking losing them to their higher preferred schools (School_B or School_C) or hoping for Student_E (Rank 1) to apply later. This is a highly satisfactory outcome.\nTherefore, I will accept Student_D."
