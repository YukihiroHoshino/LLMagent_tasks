Since School_A is currently unmatched (Capacity 1), applying now presents an extremely high probability of success, especially if Student_E (P1) has already matched elsewhere (likely, as School_C, E's top choice, is now matched/unavailable).\n\nTherefore, I will immediately apply to School_A."

While Student_E (Rank #1) is ideal, they have not applied, and School_A is only their 3rd preference. Given the high risk of rejecting Student_D (who might match with their 1st or 2nd choice school, School_B or School_C, if they receive offers), securing my Rank #2 student immediately is the optimal strategy to ensure a high-utility match within my limited quota.
