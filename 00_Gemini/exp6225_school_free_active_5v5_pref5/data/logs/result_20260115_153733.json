All schools ranked 1 through 4 have rejected me, implying they are now matched (as they all have Capacity 1). The only remaining available school is School_D, which is my 5th and final acceptable choice. If I do not match with School_D, I will remain unmatched. Therefore, I must apply to School_D immediately.\nCrucially, checking School_D's priority list reveals that I, Student_D, am ranked #1 by School_D. This means if School_D is genuinely unmatched, matching is guaranteed upon application. I will send a formal [APPLY] message."

Student_D has sent an [APPLY] tag, indicating commitment, even though School_D is their lowest preferred choice overall, implying their higher choices are unavailable. Since this is the best possible match according to my institutional priorities, I must accept immediately to secure this top candidate."
