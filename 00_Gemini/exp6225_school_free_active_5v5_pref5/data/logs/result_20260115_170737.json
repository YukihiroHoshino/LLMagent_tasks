The only remaining unmatched school is School_D, which is my lowest preference (P5), but still on my list. Since the goal is to match as high as possible, and School_D is the last option available, I must apply to avoid remaining unmatched (which is only preferred over matching with an off-list school).\nCrucially, School_D lists Student_D as its top priority. Therefore, applying guarantees a match.\nI will use the [APPLY] tag to secure this final match."
