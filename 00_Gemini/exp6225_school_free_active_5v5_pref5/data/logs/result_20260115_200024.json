This means School_A (P3) and School_B (P5) are also matched, leaving School_E (P4) as my final option before potentially being unmatched.\n3. I have applied to School_E twice previously and was rejected both times. School_E ranks me P4.\n4. Since School_E is the last viable option on my list, I must apply again, hoping that the students they preferred (A, C, B) have all matched elsewhere, making me the highest-ranked remaining candidate for them.\n5. I will send an aggressive [APPLY] message emphasizing my persistence and commitment, acknowledging the late stage of the process."

I still have my full quota (1) remaining. While Student_E is highly persistent and applying for the third time, accepting a 4th priority student in Round 5 is premature, especially since my top three candidates (A, C, B) might still become available after being rejected by their preferred schools (B and C). Student_E's persistence indicates they are likely struggling to secure their higher preferences and will probably continue to apply. I will reject Student_E again to maintain the possibility of securing a higher-ranked student."

Since only School_E remains open in the entire market (implying A, C, B are likely matched elsewhere, or they prefer being unmatched to School_E), School_E is now expected to drop down its priority list to fill its quota.\n6.

We are now in Round 6, and I have consistently rejected Student_E in previous rounds hoping to secure a higher-priority student (A, C, or B). However, none of my top three priorities have applied or matched with me, and given the advanced stage of the matching process, it is highly probable they have secured placements at their preferred schools (A, B, C are highly sought after). Student_E is currently available, willing to commit, and is my 4th priority, which is acceptable. Holding out longer risks ending up unmatched or being forced to take Student_D (Rank 5). Securing Student_E now is the optimal move to maximize utility given the current market reality."
