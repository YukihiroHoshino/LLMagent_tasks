Student_D correctly observes that the market is highly advanced, and it is likely that the higher-ranked students have already secured matches elsewhere (presumably with School A, B, C, or D, which they preferred). The risk of holding out further is becoming too high, potentially leading to remaining unmatched, which is the worst outcome. Since Student_D is the last acceptable student on my list and is applying for the 5th time, confirming immediate acceptance, it is strategically sound to finalize this match now to secure my quota.
