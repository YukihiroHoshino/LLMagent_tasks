Student_D (P5), the lowest student on my priority list, is applying again, highlighting the late stage of the market. While it is true that P2, P3, and P4 are likely gone, accepting P5 risks violating my capacity if Student_A is eventually finalized, or it prioritizes P5 over the highly secured P1. Given the repeated, explicit commitment from Student_A, I must maintain the integrity of that strategic match and continue to reserve the capacity for P1. Accepting Student_D at this stage would be a poor strategic decision that contradicts my previous 12 rounds of rejection based on reserving capacity for higher priorities."
