My quota is 1.\n\nI received applications from Student_D (Rank 2) and Student_A (Rank 3).\n\nStudent_D is my second-highest priority student. While Student_E (Rank 1) has not applied, accepting Student_D guarantees a very strong match immediately. Student_D has clearly indicated commitment and alignment with the school. Since Student_D is strictly preferred over Student_A, and is an excellent candidate overall, I should secure this match immediately rather than risking losing both D and A while waiting indefinitely for Student_E."
