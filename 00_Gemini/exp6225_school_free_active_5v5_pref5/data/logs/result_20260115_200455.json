School_E has not yet secured any of its top priorities (Student_A, Student_C, Student_B, Student_E). Accepting Student_D now would consume the only remaining quota spot, preventing a match with a significantly preferred student if they become available in later rounds. Despite Student_D's persistence, the strategic decision is to continue holding the quota for a higher-ranked candidate. Therefore, I must reject Student_D again."

Student_D's message indicates extreme commitment and desperation, stating that School_E is the 'sole high school available on my preference list.' If this is true, rejecting them again carries minimal risk of losing them, as they cannot secure a match elsewhere. Since I am only in Round 6 and still have my full quota, I must continue to hold out for higher priority students (Student_A or Student_C) who rank significantly better than Student_D. Accepting the lowest priority student now would prematurely lock in the worst possible outcome. I will reject again, maintaining a firm stance while acknowledging their commitment."

I have applied five times to School_E and been rejected every time, likely because I am their lowest priority student. However, given that four other schools have matched, it is highly probable that all other students (A, B, C, E) are already matched, making me the only remaining available student for School_E to fill its quota.
