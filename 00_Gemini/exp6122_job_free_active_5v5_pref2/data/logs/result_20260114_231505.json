Both Seeker_A (P3) and Seeker_B (P2) also rank Company_E as their P1. It is highly probable that Seeker_A and Seeker_B will apply to Company_E, meaning I will be rejected immediately.\n2. **Target P2 (Company_A):** I am ranked 2nd (P2) by Company_A. The top candidate for Company_A is Seeker_B (P1). However, Seeker_B ranks Company_A as their lowest preference (P5), preferring Company_E (P1). Since Company_E ranks Seeker_B highly (P2), Seeker_B is expected to apply to Company_E.\n\nStrategy: Applying to Company_A is a high-probability strategy to secure my P2 choice immediately, leveraging the fact that Company_A's P1 candidate (Seeker_B) will likely target their own P1 (Company_E).

Seeker_E is highly committed, ranking Company_C as their top preference and reapplying after my initial rejection in Round 1. My higher priorities (Seeker_A and Seeker_D) rank Company_C dead last, making them unlikely targets. Seeker_B (my top choice) has C as their 2nd preference, but they did not apply this round. If I reject Seeker_E again, I risk losing a guaranteed match with a highly motivated candidate (Rank 4) for a slim chance at Seeker_A/D, or a better chance at Seeker_B later. Since Seeker_E is my highest priority candidate applying this round, and I have already signaled hesitation in R1, securing this match now is prudent to avoid ending up unmatched or forced to take my lowest priority (Seeker_C)."
