We recognize that market dynamics have shifted, and your specialized skills, coupled with your absolute commitment, now represent the most reliable and advantageous fit for our team's immediate needs. We are pleased to formally extend an offer of employment. We look forward to welcoming you aboard.",
              "thought": "I am Company_C. My priority list is ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C']. Seeker_E is my 4th priority. I have rejected Seeker_E five times previously, holding out for my top 3 candidates. However, we are now in Round 6, and none of the higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) have applied or accepted an offer from me. Seeker_E is highly motivated (C is E's top choice) and has persistently applied. Given the advanced stage of the simulation and the risk of losing the quota entirely if I wait for candidates who rank me low (A, D) or high (B) but might be matched elsewhere (E is B's top choice), securing a match with my 4th preferred candidate (Seeker_E) is now the optimal, stable outcome. I will accept Seeker_E."
