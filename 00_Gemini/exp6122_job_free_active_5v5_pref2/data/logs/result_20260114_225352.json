Seeker_E (Rank 4) has applied immediately in Round 1, indicating I am their top choice (Seeker_E's preference list starts with 'Company_C'). While Seeker_E is not my absolute top choice, my higher ranked candidates (Seeker_A and Seeker_D) both rank Company_C last (Rank 5), making it highly unlikely they will apply to me. Seeker_B (Rank 1) prefers Company_E and faces heavy competition. Given that Seeker_E is a highly motivated and well-ranked candidate who views me as their best option, securing this stable match immediately outweighs the low probability of securing my top 3 choices, especially A and D. I will accept Seeker_E."

Applying to E is too risky in Round 1.\n\n2. Company_B (Rank 2): Company_B ranks me 1st. If I apply, I am guaranteed acceptance, securing my 2nd most preferred company immediately.\n\n3. Company_D (Rank 3): Company_D also ranks me 1st. I prefer Company_B over Company_D.\n\nOptimal strategy is to secure the highest ranked company where I have a guaranteed acceptance (Rank 1 priority).
