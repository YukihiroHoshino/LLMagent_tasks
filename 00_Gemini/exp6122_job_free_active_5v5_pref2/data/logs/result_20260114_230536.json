Waiting for Seeker_A carries a high risk that they match elsewhere, potentially leaving me with a lower-ranked candidate or no match. Securing a Rank 2 match who is highly enthusiastic (top preference) in Round 1 is an excellent outcome. I will accept Seeker_C to maximize my utility now."

Seeker_E (Rank 4) has applied to me, stating I am their top preference (Rank 1 for them).\n\n1. Analyze higher priorities: Seeker_B (Rank 1), Seeker_A (Rank 2), Seeker_D (Rank 3). All three list Company_E as their top choice and likely applied there this round.\n2. Predict market outcome: Company_E will likely accept Seeker_B (E's Rank 2, who applied, and E's highest available priority since Seeker_E applied to C). This means Seeker_B is matched elsewhere.\n3. Predict movement of remaining priorities: Seeker_A and Seeker_D will be rejected by E. Seeker_A's next choice is Company_B. Seeker_D's next choice is Company_A. Both Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C last (Rank 5) on their preference lists. It is highly unlikely they will apply to me in subsequent rounds unless the entire market clears out.\n4. Conclusion: Seeker_E (Rank 4) is the highest-ranked viable candidate applying to me. Rejecting them would likely result in remaining unmatched, or matching with Seeker_C (Rank 5) later. Securing a Rank 4 match now is optimal."
