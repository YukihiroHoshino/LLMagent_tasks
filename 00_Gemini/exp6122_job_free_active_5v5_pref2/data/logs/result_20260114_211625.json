Seeker_C is my second highest priority (P2). Seeker_C has applied immediately in Round 1, indicating strong interest (Company_D is their top choice, P1). While Seeker_A (P1) is technically preferred, they did not apply to me this round, likely pursuing their P1 or P2 options (Company_E or Company_B). Accepting Seeker_C guarantees a high-quality match (P2/P1) and eliminates the risk of missing out entirely if Seeker_A matches elsewhere.
