Seeker_B is my second highest priority (Rank 2) and has applied, stating I am their top choice. While Seeker_E is my Rank 1, Seeker_E ranks Company_E last in their preferences, making a successful match with them highly improbable in early rounds. Furthermore, if I reject Seeker_B, they are the top priority for Company_C, meaning I would almost certainly lose them to a competitor. Securing my Rank 2 match immediately is the optimal strategy to maximize utility and fulfill my quota, given the high risk associated with waiting for Seeker_E. I will accept Seeker_B."
