Since I have three higher-priority candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) who have not yet applied to me, and Seeker_B ranks me as their second choice, it is strategically optimal to hold my quota open for a higher-ranked match. Rejecting Seeker_E carries the risk of losing a guaranteed match (Seeker_E ranks me #1), but accepting Seeker_E eliminates the possibility of securing my top three choices.
