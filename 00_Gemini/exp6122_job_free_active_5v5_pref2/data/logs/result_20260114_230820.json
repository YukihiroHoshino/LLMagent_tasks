Seeker_C has contacted me in Round 1 with an [APPLY] tag and explicitly stated that Company_D is their top choice (Rank #1 preference for them). Securing a Rank #2 candidate who is strongly committed is an excellent outcome. While Seeker_A is my Rank #1, Seeker_A ranks me only #3 and is also Rank #1 for Company_B, making them highly contested and unlikely to reach me if I wait.

Rejecting Seeker_B carries a high risk of losing them to Company_C, where Seeker_B is Company_C's top priority (P1).
