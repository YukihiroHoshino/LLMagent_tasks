While Seeker_A is my P1 target, Seeker_A ranks Company_D as P3 and is highly likely applying to Company_E (P1 choice) or Company_B (P2 choice, where Seeker_A is Company_B's P1). Securing a P2 candidate who is strongly committed (P1 preference) in Round 1 is highly advantageous and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked match or no match at all.

This is a guaranteed match at P4 quality.\n\nMy top candidates are Seeker_B (P1), Seeker_A (P2), and Seeker_D (P3).\n\n1. Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C last (P5). They are highly unlikely to apply unless all 4 companies above me reject them.\n2. Seeker_B ranks Company_C second (P2). B likely applied to Company_E (P1 for B).\n\nIf Seeker_B applied to Company_E, Company_E's P1 (Seeker_E) is applying to me. Therefore, Seeker_B is Company_E's highest available candidate (P2 for E). It is highly probable that Company_E will accept Seeker_B immediately, eliminating my P1 option.\n\nGiven the low likelihood of securing P1, P2, or P3, accepting a highly motivated P4 candidate in Round 1 is the optimal strategy to ensure a high-quality match rather than risking being unmatched or settling for P5 (Seeker_C) later."
