If they apply to Company_E, Company_C will likely receive few applications, potentially only from me and possibly Seeker_C (who ranks C 2nd). Since I am applying to my top choice, I should use the [APPLY] action to try and secure the match immediately, exploiting the likely concentration of top talent at Company_E."
