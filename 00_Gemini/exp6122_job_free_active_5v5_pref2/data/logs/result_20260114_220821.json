My top 3 priorities (B, A, D) all rank Company_C very low (B is #2, A and D are #5), meaning they are likely targeting Company_E or other companies in Round 1. Given the high risk of my top priorities not reaching out to me, accepting a mutually favorable match (Seeker_E is rank 4 for me, and rank 1 for them) in Round 1 is a strong, stable strategy to fulfill my single quota."
