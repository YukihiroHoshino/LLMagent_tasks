If other seekers follow their preferences, only I (Seeker_C) target Company_D as my Rank 1 choice (P1). Seeker_A, B, and D target Company_E (P1), and Seeker_E targets Company_C (P1).

Seeker_C has applied directly and stated that Company_D is their top choice. While Seeker_A is my absolute top priority, Seeker_A ranks Company_D third on their list, meaning Seeker_A is likely applying to Company_E or Company_B this round, and Company_B ranks Seeker_A first. Waiting for Seeker_A carries a high risk of losing both Seeker_A (who might match elsewhere) and Seeker_C (who might move to their second choice, Company_C, if rejected).
