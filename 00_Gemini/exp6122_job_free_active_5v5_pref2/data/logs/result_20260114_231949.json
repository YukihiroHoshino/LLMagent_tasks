Securing a match with my #2 choice in Round 1 is highly desirable, as it prevents them from matching with other companies where they are also highly prioritized (e.g., Company_C where they are #1, or Company_B where they are #2).\nWhile Seeker_E (#1 priority) is theoretically available, they prefer me last among the companies they listed, making a successful match with them difficult or unlikely. \nTherefore, accepting Seeker_B is the optimal strategy to maximize priority within the current round's constraints and opportunities.
