Crucially, S_A and S_D rank Company_C (me) as their absolute last choice (Rank 5). Waiting for them to apply to me is extremely risky and unlikely to yield a match, as they will pursue Company_A, B, and D first.\n\nSeeker_E, despite being my Rank 4, ranks Company_C as their Rank 1 choice. Securing a match with a high-ranking seeker (Rank 4) who views me as their top option is a strong outcome, especially when the higher ranked candidates are highly unlikely to choose me.
