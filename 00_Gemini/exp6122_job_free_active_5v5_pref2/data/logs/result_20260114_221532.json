The seeker preferred ahead of me (Seeker_E) ranks Company_E last (5th), making it likely that Seeker_E will apply elsewhere (likely Company_C, their top choice). Therefore, applying directly to Company_E now offers the best chance of securing my rank 1 match.\nI will use the [APPLY] tag to formalize my interest immediately."

Securing Seeker_B now is a strong, low-risk move that fulfills my quota with a highly desired candidate who also ranks Company_E first. Therefore, I should accept the offer."

Seeker_E is my 4th priority (Rank 4/5), but they have applied directly in Round 1, indicating high enthusiasm (Seeker_E ranks Company_C first). My top priority, Seeker_B, is highly likely to match with Company_E this round as Company_E prefers B over A, D, C, and E's top choice (Seeker_E) applied to me. Seeker_A and Seeker_D both rank Company_C last (Rank 5), making it improbable they will approach me early. Given the low probability of securing my top 3 choices, accepting Seeker_E (Rank 4) immediately guarantees a high-ranked match and stability, preventing the risk of ending up with only Seeker_C (Rank 5) or remaining unmatched.
