After careful consideration of your profile and your unwavering enthusiasm across multiple applications, we are convinced that you possess the exact drive and alignment we seek for this role. We are pleased to formally extend an offer to you now, effective immediately.",
              "thought": "Company_C's priority list is ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C']. Seeker_E is the 4th priority (P4). We have a quota of 1. Seeker_E has applied four times previously, demonstrating unwavering commitment and ranking Company_C as their P1 choice. While P1 (Seeker_B) is desirable, the likelihood of securing P2 (Seeker_A) or P3 (Seeker_D) is extremely low as Company_C is their P5 choice. Waiting indefinitely for Seeker_B carries the risk of losing Seeker_E, a high-preference, guaranteed match, especially since we are in Round 5. Given the high commitment from Seeker_E and the low probability of securing higher-ranked candidates (P2, P3), securing P4 now is a prudent strategic move to ensure a stable match."
