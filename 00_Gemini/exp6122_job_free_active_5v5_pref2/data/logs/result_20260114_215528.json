Seeker_E is ranked 4th on my priority list ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C']. While I prefer Seeker_B, A, or D, an analysis of the market shows that they are highly likely to match with their higher preferred companies (Company_E, Company_B, Company_A) in subsequent rounds, as those companies rank them highly. Seeker_E, crucially, ranks Company_C as their 1st choice. Rejecting Seeker_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched or being forced to take Seeker_C (my lowest priority) later. Securing Seeker_E (Rank 4) now provides a stable and acceptable outcome, maximizing my utility given the current application and market dynamics."

It is unlikely Seeker_A will apply to me in Round 1.\n\nSince Seeker_C is a high-priority candidate (P2) who views me as their top choice, securing this match now is highly beneficial, as rejecting them carries the risk of losing them entirely without any guarantee of attracting Seeker_A later.
