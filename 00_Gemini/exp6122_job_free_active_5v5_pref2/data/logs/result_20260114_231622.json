It is highly probable that all three will apply to Company_E in Round 1, leaving Company_C relatively uncontested. Even if Seeker_B (ranked 1st by C) applies to C, I will be rejected, but the risk is worth taking for my top choice in R1. I must apply aggressively now."

My quota is 1.\nSeeker_E is ranked 4th on my list, which is acceptable.\nIn Round 1, Seeker_E has applied ([APPLY]).\nI must evaluate the opportunity cost of accepting Seeker_E versus waiting for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D).\n\nAnalysis of higher-ranked candidates' likely R1 applications (all prefer Company_E first):\n- Seeker_B (Rank 1): Applies to Company_E. Company_E prioritizes Seeker_B highly (Rank 2) and will likely accept Seeker_B, resulting in a match (E, B).\n- Seeker_A (Rank 2) & Seeker_D (Rank 3): Apply to Company_E and will be rejected by E (who chooses B).\n\nIf I reject Seeker_E, Seeker_A and Seeker_D will move to their next preferred companies in R2:\n- Seeker_A's next choice is Company_B. Company_B ranks Seeker_A 1st and will accept them immediately in R2.\n- Seeker_D's next choice is Company_A. Company_A ranks Seeker_D 2nd and will accept them immediately in R2.\n\nIf I reject Seeker_E now, I lose the chance to secure Seeker_A or Seeker_D, and Seeker_E (my 4th choice) will likely re-apply to me in R2 (since I am their 1st choice). Since higher-ranked candidates are highly desired by other companies and will be matched swiftly in R1/R2, accepting Seeker_E now secures the best available match (Rank 4) immediately. Waiting is too risky and likely leads to the same match (Rank 4) later, or worse."
