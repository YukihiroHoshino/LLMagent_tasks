Seeker_E's preferences are ['Company_C', 'Company_A', 'Company_D', 'Company_B', 'Company_E'].

Waiting for Seeker_E carries a significant risk of ending up with no match or a much lower priority match, as Seeker_B is highly sought after (Company_C also prioritizes Seeker_B highly).\n\nSecuring Seeker_B (P2) immediately is the optimal strategic choice, maximizing utility and minimizing risk."

Seeker_B ranks Company_C P2, but may be engaged with their P1 choice, Company_E. Given that we are in Round 3 and have rejected Seeker_E twice, rejecting them again risks losing a highly motivated candidate who is still reasonably high on my list (P4/5).
