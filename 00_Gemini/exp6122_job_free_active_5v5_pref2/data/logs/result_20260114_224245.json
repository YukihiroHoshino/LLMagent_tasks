Based on the preferences of Seeker_A and Seeker_B (both ranking Company_E as P1, and both ranked higher than me by Company_E), applying to Company_E in Round 1 is highly likely to result in immediate rejection.\n\nMy second choice is Company_A (P2). Company_A ranks me 2nd overall, behind only Seeker_B. Seeker_B ranks Company_A as P5, meaning Seeker_B is unlikely to apply to Company_A in Round 1, preferring Company_E or Company_C. This gives me an excellent opportunity to secure my P2 choice immediately and efficiently. I will formally apply to Company_A."

Securing a Rank 2 candidate who is actively applying in Round 1 is an excellent outcome and maximizes my utility immediately. I will accept Seeker_D."

Seeker_C is my second-highest priority candidate (Rank #2). Seeker_C has initiated contact with an [APPLY] tag, stating that Company_D is their absolute top choice, which aligns with Seeker_C's preference list. While Seeker_A is my Rank #1, Seeker_A ranks Company_D only third, making it unlikely they applied here in Round 1. Furthermore, if Seeker_A applied to Company_B (their Rank #2, but Company_B's Rank #1 priority), they are likely to be matched quickly.
