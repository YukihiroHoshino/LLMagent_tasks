Since this is Round 1, accepting a low-priority candidate immediately is detrimental to maximizing my objective. My top candidates (B, A, D) are currently likely applying to their top choices (E, B, A respectively).

It is highly probable that Seeker_B (ranked 2nd by Company_E) will apply to Company_E and be accepted in R1, leading to my rejection.\n\nI will pivot to my second preference, Company_A. Company_A ranks me 2nd overall (behind only Seeker_B). If Seeker_B pursues Company_E (their top choice), Company_A will likely receive no application from their Rank 1 candidate. By applying to Company_A in Round 1, I maximize my chances of securing a very high-ranked match immediately (Rank 2), which is preferable to risking a rejection and potentially being forced to settle for a lower-ranked company later. I will formally [APPLY] to secure this position."

Although Seeker_E was rejected by Company_C in Round 1, the fact that Company_C is still unmatched suggests that their higher priority candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) either matched elsewhere or were rejected by C, meaning Company_C may now be willing to consider lower-ranked candidates like Seeker_E (4th on C's priority list).

Seeker_E has consistently applied (3 times) and stated Company_C is their top preference. While I prefer Seeker_B, Seeker_A, or Seeker_D, the likelihood of securing Seeker_A or Seeker_D is extremely low as Company_C is their absolute last preference. Seeker_B is highly sought after by Company_E (B is E's 2nd choice). By rejecting Seeker_E twice, I risked losing them entirely. Seeker_E is highly motivated and available now. Securing a Rank 4 candidate who views me as their top choice is a strong outcome early in the process, mitigating the risk of being left with only Rank 5 candidates or going unmatched if higher priorities match elsewhere.
