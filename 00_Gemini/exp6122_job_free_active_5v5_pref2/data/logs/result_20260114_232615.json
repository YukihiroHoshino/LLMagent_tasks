Company_D ranks Seeker_C second on its priority list, right after Seeker_A. If Seeker_A applies elsewhere (their P1 is Company_E), I stand an excellent chance of being accepted immediately by Company_D. Even if Seeker_A applies to Company_D, I still need to apply now to secure a strong position for future rounds.
