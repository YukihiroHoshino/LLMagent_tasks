While Seeker_E (P1) is technically preferred, they rank me last (P5), making a successful match unlikely in early rounds. Seeker_B is a highly competitive candidate who ranks me P1, and accepting them secures a strong match immediately. Given the high rank (P2) and the risk of losing them to other companies (where they are also highly ranked, e.g., P1 for Company_C), I should accept Seeker_B now."
