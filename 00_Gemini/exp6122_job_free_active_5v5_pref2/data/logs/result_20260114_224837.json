Seeker_E is currently my 4th preference. Since this is Round 1 and I only have one quota, accepting Seeker_E now would prevent me from matching with my top 3 choices (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) who are likely pursuing their top preferences (Company_E, Company_B, Company_A) this round. Given the low priority rank of Seeker_E, I will reject the application now to keep my quota open for a higher-ranked candidate in subsequent rounds.
