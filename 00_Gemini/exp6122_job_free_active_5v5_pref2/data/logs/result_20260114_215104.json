Seeker_E is ranked 4th. My top priority, Seeker_B, ranks Company_C as their second choice. Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C last (5th), making them unlikely targets unless the market collapses entirely. Since I still have a chance with Seeker_B, and Seeker_E has demonstrated unwavering commitment (C is their 1st choice and they have applied repeatedly), the risk of losing Seeker_E immediately upon rejection is low. I must continue to prioritize waiting for Seeker_B or confirming their status before settling for Seeker_E. Therefore, I will reject Seeker_E again to keep my options open for higher-ranked candidates."

My previous five attempts to apply were rejected, despite my strong appeals and assertions that the market was stabilizing. Company_C is clearly holding out, even though their higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) must have matched with the other four companies (A, B, D, E) which are now filled. Since Company_C ranks me 4th, and I am the last available seeker, this match must occur for stability.

Seeker_E is now claiming that the market has resolved and that B, A, and D are matched elsewhere, making Seeker_E the highest available candidate (P4). Since Seeker_E ranks Company_C as their top preference (#1), this match, if accepted now, is highly stable and ensures I fill my quota with the best available option, avoiding the risk of ending up unmatched or matching with Seeker_C (P5). Given that we are in Round 7 and Seeker_E's commitment is unparalleled, it is time to secure the match."
