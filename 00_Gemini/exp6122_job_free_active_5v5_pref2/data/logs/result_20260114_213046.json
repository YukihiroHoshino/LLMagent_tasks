Since Seeker_B is significantly higher priority than Seeker_D, and I only have one quota, I must reject Seeker_D to keep the quota available for Seeker_B or potentially Seeker_E (who hasn't applied yet, but is unlikely to apply if I fill the quota now).

My Rank 1 choice, Seeker_A, did not apply to me this round, suggesting they targeted a higher preference (Company_E or Company_B).

Seeker_E is my 4th priority.\n\nSeeker_E has applied immediately and stated that Company_C is their absolute top preference, ensuring a highly stable match.\n\nIn Round 1, I must assess the probability of securing my higher priorities (B, A, D):\n1. Seeker_A (Rank 2) and Seeker_D (Rank 3) are likely to be matched quickly with Company_B (A's Rank 1 priority) and Company_A (D's Rank 2 priority) respectively, as they are high priorities for those companies.\n2. Seeker_B (Rank 1) likely applied to Company_E (B's Rank 1 preference). Company_E ranks Seeker_B 2nd. Given that Seeker_E (Company_E's Rank 1) applied to Company_C, Company_E is likely to accept Seeker_B. This means Seeker_B is also likely to be matched elsewhere in this round.\n\nSince securing a match with my top 3 candidates appears low risk, accepting Seeker_E (Rank 4) who views me as their Rank 1 choice is a strategically sound decision to fill the quota with a committed candidate, preventing the risk of ending up with only Seeker_C (Rank 5) or no match at all."
