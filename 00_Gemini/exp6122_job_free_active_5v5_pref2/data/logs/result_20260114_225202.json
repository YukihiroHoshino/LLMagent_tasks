Seeker_E is ranked 4th. While Seeker_E applying immediately (and having Company_C as their 1st choice) is tempting, accepting them would fill my single quota and prevent me from matching with my top 3 candidates (B, A, D). Seeker_B (my #1 priority) ranks Company_C as their 2nd choice. If Seeker_B's top choice (Company_E) rejects them, Seeker_B is highly likely to apply to Company_C next round. Since it is only Round 1, it is strategically sound to hold out for a higher priority match. Therefore, I must reject Seeker_E for now to keep the quota open."

Since Company_D and Company_E are now matched (implying 2 seekers are matched), it is highly probable that some of those higher priority seekers (e.g., S_B or S_D) have found matches elsewhere, or are now targeting their next highest available preference (Company_A or Company_B).\n\nIf S_A and S_D (who are higher priority for C_C than me) target A and B (which are high on their remaining lists), Company_C might receive few or no proposals, or only mine.
