I want to confirm, for the final time, that Company_C is my undisputed, highest professional priority. I am fully available and prepared to accept this role immediately. I formally apply now, urging you to finalize our long-awaited agreement and allow me to begin contributing to your mission without any further delay.",

I have repeatedly applied and been rejected with encouraging messages stating they are in the 'final stages' of internal review. Since the market is now almost entirely cleared (only Company_C remains), Company_C must make a decision based on its available candidates. Given that Seeker_E is Company_C's Rank 4 preference, and assuming the top three (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) are matched elsewhere, Seeker_E is now Company_C's most preferred available candidate. I must use this opportunity to apply one last time, emphasizing the finality of the hiring window and my persistent commitment."

We deeply value your dedication and the fact that Company_C remains your undisputed top professional priority. We are pleased to inform you that our executive review has concluded, and your candidacy aligns perfectly with our strategic needs. We formally accept your application. Welcome aboard, Seeker_E!",
              "thought": "I am Company_C. My priority list is ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E', 'Seeker_C']. Seeker_E is my 4th priority. We have reached Round 7, and I have stalled Seeker_E (who ranks C as their 1st choice) for six rounds, hoping to secure a higher-ranked candidate (B, A, or D). Given that Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C last (5th), securing them is highly improbable. Seeker_B ranks C 2nd, but likely prefers Company_E. At this stage, continuing to stall Seeker_E risks losing a highly committed candidate who is ranked acceptably (4th), leading to potentially failing to fill the quota entirely. Seeker_E's message indicates they are highly dedicated and the market is concluding. It is prudent to secure this stable match now to fulfill the quota (1) with a highly preferred candidate (E's #1 choice)."
