According to the stable matching theory (Job Proposing Deferred Acceptance), the optimal strategy for the proposer (Seeker) is to always propose to their most preferred available company in the first round.

While Seeker_E is a strong candidate, they are not my highest priority.\nSince this is Round 1, I have not yet heard from my top targets (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). Seeker_B lists me as their #2 choice, making them a realistic target if they are rejected by their #1 choice (Company_E). \nTo maximize my outcome, I must hold out for candidates ranked #1, #2, or #3.

While Seeker_A is my P1, Seeker_A lists Company_D as P3 and is likely pursuing higher-ranked companies (like Company_E).

Since Company_C rejected my application in Round 1, they were likely holding out for candidates they preferred (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D). Assuming a rational market progression (Deferred Acceptance logic), it is highly probable that those higher-ranked candidates have now applied and been tentatively matched with other companies (e.g., Company_E, Company_B, Company_D) where they were prioritized. If C's preferred candidates are now off the market, I, Seeker_E (ranked 4th by C), become their highest available applicant.\nI will re-apply to Company_C, emphasizing my unwavering commitment, hoping that the competitive pool has cleared, allowing them to accept me this round. Applying to Company_A (P2), where I am ranked dead last (5th), is a higher risk unless I know for certain that all four candidates preferred over me are matched."

However, Seeker_E has applied aggressively (twice) and stated that Company_C is their top priority (matching their listed preference). Since this is Round 2 and I have not secured a higher-ranked candidate (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D are not applying), and Seeker_A and Seeker_D rank Company_C very low, waiting for them is highly risky. Seeker_B (Rank 1 for me) might still be obtainable, but securing Seeker_E now guarantees a match with a highly committed candidate. Given the certainty of the match and the commitment level, securing Rank 4 now is better than risking an empty quota waiting for uncertain higher ranks."
