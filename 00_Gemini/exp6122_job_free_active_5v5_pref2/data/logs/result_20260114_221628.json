Seeker_E has sent an [APPLY] request. Seeker_E lists Company_C as their top choice (Rank 1). \n\nMy top priority, Seeker_B (Rank 1), likely applied to Company_E (S_B's Rank 1). Since Company_E also prioritizes S_B highly (Rank 2), S_B is likely to be matched there, removing my highest priority candidate.\n\nMy 2nd and 3rd priorities (Seeker_A and Seeker_D) both rank Company_C as their lowest choice (Rank 5), making it highly improbable that they will ever apply, even if rejected elsewhere. \n\nGiven the low likelihood of matching with my top 3 candidates, securing Seeker_E (Rank 4) who is highly motivated (C is their Rank 1) is a strategically sound move in Round 1 to fill the quota efficiently. I will accept the application."

If Seeker_A targets Company_E, Company_D will receive my application as their highest-ranked applicant in this round (R2). Given this favorable position for my top choice, I should formally apply immediately to secure the match."

Seeker_C has applied to me in Round 1, indicating I am their top choice. While Seeker_A is my absolute top priority, they did not apply this round (likely applying to their top choice, Company_E). Securing a high-priority, highly interested candidate like Seeker_C immediately in Round 1 is an excellent outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked match or no match at all if I wait for Seeker_A, who may match elsewhere. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_C."

Company_D is my third choice, and they also rank me 1st. \n\nComparing B (2nd choice, rank 1st) and D (3rd choice, rank 1st), B is strictly better for me.
