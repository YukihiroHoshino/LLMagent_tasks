I am ranked 2nd on Company_A's priority list (['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_D', ...]). Seeker_B (A's #1 choice) is likely targeting Company_E (B's #1 choice). By targeting Company_A, I maximize my probability of securing a high-ranking match (Rank #2), which is better than risking rejection for Rank #1 and potentially being forced into a lower match later.\nTherefore, I will formally apply to Company_A."

It is highly probable that A, B, and D will target Company_E in Round 1. This diversion of competition makes Company_C a high-probability match for me, despite my low priority ranking there.

My higher priority candidates (Seeker_A and Seeker_D) rank me last, making it highly unlikely they will apply unless rejected by everyone else. Seeker_B (Rank 1) likely applied to Company_E (their Rank 1).
