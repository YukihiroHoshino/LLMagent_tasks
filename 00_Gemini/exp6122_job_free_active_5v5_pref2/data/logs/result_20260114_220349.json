Company_D (P3): I am also ranked 1st by D. \n\nSince Company_B is my second choice, and I am the top candidate on their priority list, this is a highly desirable and secure match opportunity for Round 1.

Seeker_B (My #1) prefers Company_E (#1). B is likely matched elsewhere quickly.\n2. Seeker_A (My #2) prefers Company_E (#1), Company_B (#2). Company_C is A's last choice (#5).\n3. Seeker_D (My #3) prefers Company_E (#1), Company_A (#2). Company_C is D's last choice (#5).\n\nSince my top three candidates strongly prefer other companies and rank me last, waiting for them is highly risky and likely leads to being unmatched. Seeker_E, while my 4th choice, is highly enthusiastic and guarantees a match. Securing a strong, committed candidate early outweighs the minimal chance of attracting my top priorities given the market structure.\n\nTherefore, I will accept Seeker_E."
