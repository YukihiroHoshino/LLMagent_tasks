Since we are now in Round 6 and Company_C is still unmatched, it is highly likely that their preferred candidates have matched elsewhere. This is my final opportunity to secure a match with my highest preference. I must continue applying and emphasize my unwavering commitment and proven readiness, leveraging the fact that the candidate pool is now severely restricted."

Seeker_E is Rank 4.\n\nSeeker_E has applied persistently (Round 6) and views Company_C as their absolute top priority (Rank 1). I have rejected Seeker_E multiple times already.\n\nHolding out for Seeker_B (Rank 1) is risky because Seeker_B prefers Company_E (Rank 1 for B), and Company_E ranks Seeker_B highly (Rank 2 for E). Seeker_A and Seeker_D (Ranks 2 & 3) rank Company_C dead last (Rank 5).\n\nGiven the late stage of the process (Round 6) and the high likelihood that higher-ranked candidates will match elsewhere or never apply to me, continuing to reject Seeker_E risks losing a highly dedicated candidate and potentially being forced to accept Seeker_C (Rank 5) or remain unmatched. Securing Rank 4 now is a strong strategic move given the competitive landscape for my top targets."

Although I have previously held out for higher priorities (B, A, D), none of them have applied in this round, and the risk of remaining unmatched increases significantly if I continue to reject stable matches at this late stage. Furthermore, we have previously accepted Seeker_E multiple times, demonstrating internal recognition of their value. Securing Seeker_E now guarantees a stable match before the market concludes. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_E."
