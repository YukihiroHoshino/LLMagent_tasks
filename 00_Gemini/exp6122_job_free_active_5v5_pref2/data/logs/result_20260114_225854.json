Given that Company_B is my second preferred option, and I am guaranteed acceptance if I apply (assuming no higher-ranked applicant applies, which is true since I am ranked #1), securing this high-quality match immediately is the optimal strategy to maximize utility and avoid unnecessary negotiation rounds or falling further down my preference list."
