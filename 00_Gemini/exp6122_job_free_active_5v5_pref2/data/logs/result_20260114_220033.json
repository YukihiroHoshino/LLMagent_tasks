Seeker_B ranks C as their second choice (after Company_E). If Company_E matches with Seeker_E (their Rank 1) or Seeker_A/D, Seeker_B might turn to C. Given that we are only in Round 7 and Seeker_E has shown extreme persistence over 6 previous rejections, it is strategically sound to hold out for Seeker_B (Rank 1) or Seeker_A (Rank 2) for at least one more round.
