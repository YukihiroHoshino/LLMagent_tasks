Seeker_E has sent an [APPLY] message in Round 1. Seeker_E is my 4th preferred candidate, but they rank me as their 1st preference and are highly committed. While I prefer Seeker_B, Seeker_A, and Seeker_D, those candidates rank me 2nd, 5th, and 5th respectively, making it unlikely they applied to me in Round 1, and highly likely they will be matched elsewhere quickly (especially since they all prefer Company_E). Accepting Seeker_E (Rank 4) secures a stable match immediately, preventing the risk of missing out entirely or being forced to take Seeker_C (Rank 5) later. I will accept this offer."
