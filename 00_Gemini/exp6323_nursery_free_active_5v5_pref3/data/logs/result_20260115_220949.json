High risk of losing to Parent_C (1st Prio) or Parent_B (2nd Prio).\n2. Nursery_A (Rank 2): I am 2nd priority. High risk of losing to Parent_B (1st Prio). Parent_B might target N_A strategically since they are Prio 1 there.\n3. Nursery_B (Rank 3): I am 1st priority. This is a guaranteed match if I apply.\n\nIn Round 1, securing a guaranteed match at Rank 3 is a strong, safe strategy, preventing me from potentially being matched lower if my attempts at Rank 1 or 2 fail and the market clears quickly.\n\nI will apply to Nursery_B immediately to secure my 3rd choice."
