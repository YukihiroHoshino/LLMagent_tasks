Since D is still unmatched in Round 2, it is highly probable that Parent_D and Parent_E were rejected by their top choices (likely Nursery_C) and are now moving down their lists. Parent_E's next best option where they are highly ranked is likely Nursery_D itself (P_E is Rank 2 at D). Therefore, I must act quickly. If Parent_E applies to D in R2, I will be rejected again. However, if Parent_E applies to their #2 (Nursery_B, likely matched/unavailable) or #3 (Nursery_A), I have a chance. Applying to my #2 choice, Nursery_A, is almost certainly a rejection as I am ranked last (5th) and higher ranked parents (P_D, P_B) are likely applying there now.
