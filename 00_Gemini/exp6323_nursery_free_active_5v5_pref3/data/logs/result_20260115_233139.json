Analyze Nursery_D: N_D's priority list is ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_A']. Parent_E is ranked P2 here, which is my highest rank across all nurseries.\n2. Analyze Competition at N_D: Parent_D (P1) has N_C as their top choice and is highly expected to apply there. Parent_C (P3) has N_D as their top choice and is expected to apply here.\n3. Strategy: If Parent_D applies to N_C (P_D's #1), Parent_E (P2) becomes the effective highest priority applicant at N_D, beating Parent_C (P3).
