Given the high likelihood that these superior candidates will apply to their top choices in R1, Parent_E (P_E) is likely to be rejected by C, B, and A.\n2. Analyze Nursery D (P_E's 4th choice): Nursery D ranks P_E 2nd (['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', ...]). The parent ranked 1st (P_D) is applying to C (P_D's #1). The highest ranked parent likely applying to D is P_C (D's #3 priority, P_C's #1 preference). Since P_E (Rank 2) is preferred over P_C (Rank 3) by Nursery D, applying to D guarantees a match for P_E.\n3.
