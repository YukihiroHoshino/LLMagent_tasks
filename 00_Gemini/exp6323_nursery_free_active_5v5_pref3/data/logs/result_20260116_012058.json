If rejected, the market will likely clear, leaving me only with N_E (my 5th choice) in Round 2.\n\nHowever, if I apply to Nursery_D (my 4th choice), I analyze the competition. Parent_C ranks N_D as their 1st choice and is the likely competitor. At Nursery_D, I (Parent_E) have 2nd priority, while Parent_C has 3rd priority.
