The fact that my higher-ranked candidates (P_A, P_C, P_B) are not applying suggests they have successfully matched with their preferred nurseries (N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D), where they ranked Nursery_E low (4th or 5th preference). Waiting longer carries the high risk of remaining unmatched, as P_D (my lowest priority) is unlikely to improve my outcome. Since Parent_E is applying with absolute commitment and is still on my priority list, accepting this match secures my quota with the highest available candidate remaining."
