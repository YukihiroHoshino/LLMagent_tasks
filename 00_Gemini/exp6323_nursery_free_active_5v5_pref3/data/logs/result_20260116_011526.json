Analyzing Nursery_D (4th preference):\n    a. My priority rank at N_D is 2nd, which is my highest priority ranking across all nurseries.\n    b. Parent_D (1st priority at N_D) prefers N_C first and is expected to apply there.\n    c. Parent_C (3rd priority at N_D) prefers N_D first and is expected to apply here.\n3.

If I apply to N_D, I will be accepted because N_D prefers me (2nd priority) over Parent_C (3rd priority), who is the only other strong applicant.
