While Parent_D (P1) and Parent_A (P2) are higher priority, Parent_D lists me as their 3rd choice and Parent_A lists me as their 4th choice, meaning they are likely applying to higher preferred nurseries (Nursery_A or Nursery_C) in Round 1. Securing a Parent ranked 3rd out of 5 in the first round, especially one who prioritizes me highly, is a very strong outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked or no match later.
