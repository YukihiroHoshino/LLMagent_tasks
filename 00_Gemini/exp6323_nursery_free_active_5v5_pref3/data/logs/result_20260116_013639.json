Nursery_B (P_B #1 preference): P_B is only the 3rd priority here (behind P_D and P_A). Applying here is risky.\n2. Nursery_D (P_B #2 preference): P_B is only the 4th priority here (behind P_D, P_E, P_C). Applying here is very risky.\n3. Nursery_A (P_B #3 preference): P_B is the **1st priority** for Nursery_A.\n\nSince Nursery_A is my third preference and I am their top priority, applying immediately guarantees a match at a reasonably high level (Rank 3). This prevents me from being shut out of N_A if Parent_D (N_A's 2nd priority, N_A is P_D's 2nd preference) decides to apply there, which they might do if their top choice (N_C) rejects them.

N_A (R2): P2 priority. P_B is P1 priority. Since N_A is Rank 3 for P_B, and P_B is P1 here, P_B is highly likely to apply to N_A for a guaranteed match, meaning I would be rejected.\n3.
