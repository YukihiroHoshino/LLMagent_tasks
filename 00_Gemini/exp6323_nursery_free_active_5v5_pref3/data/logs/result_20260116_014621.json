Parent_E has submitted a formal [APPLY]. Since it is Round 4, and my highest preferred parents (A, C, B) rank Nursery_E very low (4th or 5th preference), it is highly likely they have matched elsewhere or are pursuing higher-ranked nurseries. Rejecting Parent_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched entirely. Accepting Parent_E secures a match with a parent who is still preferred over Parent_D. I will accept this application to fulfill my quota."
