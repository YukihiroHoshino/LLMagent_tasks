P_A is N_A's highest remaining priority candidate. If I propose N_A (Prio 5 at N_A), I will certainly be rejected, and N_A will match P_A.\n2. Nursery_D (Rank 1): I was rejected by N_D in R1, likely because they were holding out for P_D or P_E (Prio 1 and 2). P_D is matched. P_E (Prio 2) is active and will likely propose N_A (3rd choice). N_A will reject P_E (in favor of P_A). N_D knows P_E will return in R3. N_D is rational and should wait for P_E, who is ranked higher than me (P_C, Prio 3).\n\nIf I apply to N_A, I waste the round and N_A is gone. If I apply to N_D, I force N_D's hand. Although N_D is likely waiting for P_E, applying aggressively to my top choice is necessary to maximize preference rank, especially since N_A is a lost cause. I must use a compelling message to emphasize commitment, hoping N_D prefers a bird in the hand over two in the bush."

While Parent_A, Parent_C, and Parent_B are ranked higher, Parent_A and Parent_C rank Nursery_E last on their preference lists, making it highly unlikely they will apply unless all other options (Nursery A, B, C, D) fail. Parent_B ranks me 4th, which is also low. Given that Parent_E has formally applied in Round 4, indicating strong commitment and that I am their only remaining preference, securing this match minimizes the risk of remaining unmatched, even though P_E is not my top choice. Since the chance of attracting my top 3 choices is very low, I will accept the current definite offer."
