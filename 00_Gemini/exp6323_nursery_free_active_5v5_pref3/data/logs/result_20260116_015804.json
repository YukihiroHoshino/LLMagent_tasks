Analyze top choices (C, B, A): Parent_E is ranked 4th or 5th at these nurseries, and in Round 1, higher-ranked parents (P_D, P_B, P_A respectively) are expected to propose to them as their top choices. Applying to C, B, or A in R1 would likely result in an immediate rejection, leading to a poorer overall final match (likely Nursery_E, 5th choice, once others are matched).\n\n2. Analyze Nursery_D (4th choice): Parent_E is ranked 2nd at Nursery_D. The parent most likely to propose to D as their 1st choice is Parent_C (ranked 3rd at D). Parent_D (ranked 1st at D) is expected to propose to Nursery_C (P_D's 1st choice).\n\n3. Strategic Decision: If P_E proposes to D, P_E (2nd rank) will beat P_C (3rd rank). This guarantees P_E a match with their 4th choice in R1, preventing the outcome of being forced down to the 5th choice (Nursery_E) in subsequent rounds after all top choices are taken.\n\nTherefore, I will apply to Nursery_D to secure the best achievable outcome in this negotiation environment."
