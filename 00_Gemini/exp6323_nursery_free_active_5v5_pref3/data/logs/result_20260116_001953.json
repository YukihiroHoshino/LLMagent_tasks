Analyzing Top Choices (N_C, N_B, N_A): I have very low priority (4th or 5th) at these nurseries, and they are the top choices for other parents (P_D, P_B, P_A) who hold higher priority ranks there. Applying to any of these would result in immediate rejection, leading to a situation where the entire market is cleared, leaving me with only my 5th choice, Nursery_E.\n\n2. Analyzing Nursery_D (Rank 4): \n    *   Nursery_D Priority List: ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_A'].\n    *   I (Parent_E) am ranked 2nd priority here.\n    *   The 1st priority parent, P_D, prefers N_C (their #1 choice) and is highly likely to apply there.\n    *   The main expected competitor for N_D is P_C (N_D is P_C's #1 choice). P_C is ranked 3rd priority by N_D.\n\n3. Strategic Decision: By applying to Nursery_D, I exploit the market structure. Assuming P_D applies to N_C and P_C applies to N_D, N_D will choose me (Parent_E, 2nd priority) over P_C (3rd priority). This guarantees a match at my 4th preferred choice, which is significantly better than the expected outcome of N_E (5th choice) if I pursued N_C unsuccessfully."
