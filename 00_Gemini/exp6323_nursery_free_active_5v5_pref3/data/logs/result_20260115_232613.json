If Parent_D has not matched yet, they are a better potential match for me.\nSince it is only Round 4, accepting my 4th choice now would eliminate the possibility of matching with my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice later.

I have rejected Parent_E four times already (R1-R4) hoping to attract higher priority parents (P_C, P_B, P_D), especially P_D who ranks me 1st. Given that we are now in Round 5 and I have not received any applications from P_C, P_B, or P_D, it is highly likely that these parents have either been matched elsewhere (P_D is highly ranked by N_A and N_B) or are focused on higher preferences (P_C). Continuing to reject Parent_E risks ending up unmatched or forced to accept Parent_A (5th priority) later. Parent_E has shown extreme dedication and ranks me 1st.
