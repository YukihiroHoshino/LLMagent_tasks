Parent_C has applied repeatedly (this is the 5th attempt) and was rejected every time because I am holding out for higher-ranked parents.

Since only Parent_C applied this round, and the market is still active, I must assume that Parents B, D, and E might still be available or might apply in future rounds if their current preferred nurseries reject them.

This means Parent_C is now the highest available candidate on Nursery_A's priority list. Therefore, Parent_C must submit another formal application ([APPLY]) to force Nursery_A to either accept or finally match with a higher-ranked parent if they haven't already.

For six rounds, Nursery_A has rejected Parent_C, holding out for higher-ranked candidates (P_B, P_D, P_A, P_E). It is now Round 7, and Parent_C notes that Nursery_A appears to be the sole unmatched nursery, suggesting higher-ranked candidates are settled. Given that P_B, P_D, P_A, and P_E have not applied or reapplied for several rounds, it is highly probable they have matched with their higher preferences (e.g., P_D likely matched N_B, P_A likely matched N_B or N_C after rejection). If all candidates ranked 1-4 are unavailable, Parent_C becomes the highest available candidate on the list. To secure a match and fulfill the quota of 1, accepting Parent_C now is the optimal move, as waiting longer risks going unmatched entirely."
