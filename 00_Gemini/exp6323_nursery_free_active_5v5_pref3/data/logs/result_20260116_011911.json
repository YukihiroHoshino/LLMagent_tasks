I must analyze the competition for Nursery_C.\n\nParent_D's ranking at N_C is 3rd (behind P_C and P_B).\n1. Parent_C (P_C's #1 choice is N_D)\n2. Parent_B (P_B's #1 choice is N_B)\n3. Parent_D (P_D's #1 choice is N_C)\n4. Parent_E (P_E's #1 choice is N_C)\n5. Parent_A\n\nBased on standard Deferred Acceptance logic (where everyone applies to their top choice):\n*   P_C will apply to N_D and likely be accepted (P_C is 3rd priority at N_D, but P_D is 1st priority). Wait, let's look closer at N_D.\n    *   N_D Priority: P_D (1st), P_E (2nd), P_C (3rd), P_B, P_A.\n    *   P_C applies to N_D. P_D applies to N_C. P_E applies to N_C.\n    *   N_D receives P_C. N_D accepts P_C if P_D and P_E apply elsewhere.\n    *   N_D only receives P_C (since P_D and P_E apply to N_C).\n    *   N_D accepts P_C.\n*   P_B will apply to N_B and likely be accepted (P_B is 3rd priority at N_B, but P_D is 1st priority).\n    *   N_B Priority: P_D (1st), P_A (2nd), P_B (3rd).\n    *   P_D applies to N_C. P_A applies to N_A. P_B applies to N_B.\n    *   N_B receives P_B. N_B accepts P_B.\n\nSince P_C and P_B (the two higher priority parents for N_C) are expected to propose to their own #1 choices (N_D and N_B, respectively, where they have good chances), Nursery_C will only receive applications from P_D (3rd priority) and P_E (4th priority). N_C prefers P_D over P_E. Therefore, applying directly to Nursery_C should result in an immediate match. I will use the [APPLY] action."
