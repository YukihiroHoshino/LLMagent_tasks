Parent_D is my 5th (and lowest) priority, but they are on my acceptable list. Since we are in Round 4 and I have received no other applications this round, and given that Nursery_E is ranked very low (4th or 5th) by all my higher priority parents (A, C, B, E), waiting longer carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched.
