Analyzing overall market clearance: Under standard DA assumptions, all other parents (A, B, C, D) are likely to secure their Rank 1 choices due to favorable priority rankings relative to top competitors (they are ranked 3rd, while top priorities apply elsewhere). If this occurs, I would be forced down to my 5th choice, Nursery_E, in subsequent rounds.\n3. Strategic opportunity at Nursery_D (Rank 4): I am ranked 2nd by Nursery_D, which is my highest priority ranking across all nurseries. Parent_C (Rank 1 N_D) is ranked 3rd by N_D. If I apply to N_D now, I have higher priority (2nd) than the likely primary competitor, Parent_C (3rd). \n\nBy strategically applying to Nursery_D in Round 1, I guarantee a match at Rank 4, improving upon the expected Rank 5 outcome if I followed the truthful preference path.
