In standard deferred acceptance mechanisms, the optimal strategy in the first round is to apply to the highest ranked school. Although Nursery_A ranks me 3rd (behind Parent_B and Parent_D), analyzing the other parents' top choices suggests they might apply elsewhere in Round 1:\n- Parent_B's top choice is Nursery_B.\n- Parent_D's top choice is Nursery_C.\nSince it is highly likely that my top competitors for Nursery_A (P_B and P_D) will apply to their own top choices, Nursery_A might only receive my application (or applications from lower priority parents who still rank N_A highly). Therefore, applying directly to Nursery_A in Round 1 maximizes my chances of securing my Rank 1 preference immediately."
