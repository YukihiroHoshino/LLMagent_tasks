Assuming those higher priority parents have matched with their own high preferences (C, D, or B), I should now be the highest remaining priority parent for Nursery_A (I am 3rd overall, ahead of Parent_E). This is the critical round for Nursery_A to finalize its decision. I must apply aggressively one final time to secure my top choice before settling for Nursery_E (where I am Priority 1 and guaranteed acceptance, but it's my lowest preference)."

Parent_A is the highest-ranked applicant currently applying.\n\nHolding out for Parent_B (Rank 1) or Parent_D (Rank 2) is risky. They have not applied to me yet, indicating they are still pursuing their higher preferences (Nursery_B/Nursery_C). If they become available, it will be in later rounds, but by then, Parent_A, who is highly desirable to Nursery_B (Rank 2 priority), might be matched elsewhere.\n\nParent_A has applied repeatedly (4 times), demonstrating strong commitment and ranking Nursery_A as their first choice. Securing a Rank 3 match in Round 4 is a very strong outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked candidate or unmatched. I will accept Parent_A."
