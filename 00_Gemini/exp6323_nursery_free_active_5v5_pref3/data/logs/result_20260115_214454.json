However, based on their preferences, Parent_A likely applied to Nursery_B, and Parent_B likely applied to Nursery_A. If they are accepted there, they will not reach out to me. Parent_C is the highest-ranked parent who has contacted me. Accepting Parent_C secures a match immediately, fulfilling my quota with a relatively high-priority parent. Rejecting them risks losing Parent_C to their next preference (Nursery_B) and potentially ending up unmatched if Parent_A and Parent_B are matched elsewhere. Therefore, I will accept Parent_C."

It is highly probable that all higher-ranked parents have secured matches with their preferred nurseries. Parent_E is the only candidate who ranks Nursery_E as their P1 choice, and they are applying again. If I reject Parent_E now, I risk remaining unmatched entirely.
