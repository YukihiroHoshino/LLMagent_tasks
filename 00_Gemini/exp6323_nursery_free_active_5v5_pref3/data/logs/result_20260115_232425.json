If I apply truthfully to N_C, I predict that N_A, N_B, N_C, and N_D will all be matched by higher priority parents in R1, leaving me with only N_E (Rank 5) in R2.\n\nI must look for a strategic application where I have a competitive advantage in R1. My 4th choice is Nursery_D. Parent_C (whose top choice is N_D) is expected to apply there. Nursery_D's priority list places Parent_E (me) 2nd, and Parent_C 3rd. By applying to N_D, I outrank the expected applicant (P_C) and secure an immediate match at my 4th preferred option (N_D), which is better than ending up with my 5th preferred option (N_E).
