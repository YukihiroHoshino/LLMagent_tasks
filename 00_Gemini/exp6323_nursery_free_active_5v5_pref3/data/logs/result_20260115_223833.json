Parent_D's top choice is C. Based on global preferences, it is highly likely that Parent_B and Parent_D will apply to their respective top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_C) in Round 1, leaving Nursery_A available for Parent_A, who is the highest priority applicant among those who prefer Nursery_A first (or who might apply here).\n4.
