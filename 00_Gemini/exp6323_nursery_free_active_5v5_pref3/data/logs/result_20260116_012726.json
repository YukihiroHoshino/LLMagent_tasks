If I apply to N_C (1st choice), I anticipate being rejected by Parent_D (who also targets N_C and has higher priority). This would leave me matched with N_E (5th choice) in Round 2, assuming all other parents apply to their top choice.\n\n2. Analyze N_D (4th choice): I am ranked 2nd by Nursery_D, which is my highest priority ranking in the entire market. \n   * Competition check for N_D: Parent_D (Rank 1) is likely targeting N_C (P_D's 1st choice). Parent_C (Rank 3) is targeting N_D (P_C's 1st choice).\n   * If I apply to N_D, N_D receives applications from P_E (Rank 2) and P_C (Rank 3). N_D will accept P_E.\n\n3.
