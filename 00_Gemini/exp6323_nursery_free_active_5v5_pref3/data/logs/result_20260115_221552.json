Nursery_E is my 5th and lowest preference, but it is still preferable to remaining unmatched. Crucially, I checked Nursery_E's priority list, and Parent_A is their absolute highest priority ('Parent_A', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_D'). Since this is the last available option and I am guaranteed acceptance due to being their top priority, I must formally apply ([APPLY]) immediately to secure the match and exit the market."

Parent_A is currently Rank 1 on my list and has submitted a formal [APPLY]. Since I have a remaining quota of 1 and Parent_A is my top choice, I must accept this application immediately to secure the best match."
