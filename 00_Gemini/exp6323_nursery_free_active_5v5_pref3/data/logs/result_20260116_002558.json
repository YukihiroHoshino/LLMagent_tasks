It is highly likely that both Parent_D and Parent_A will apply to their respective P1 choices in Round 1, leaving Nursery_B open to receiving applications from lower-ranked parents.\n\nSince Parent_B ranks 3rd overall for Nursery_B, and Nursery_B is Parent_B's absolute top choice, I must use [APPLY] immediately to secure the spot before a lower-ranked parent (like Parent_C or Parent_E) applies and gets accepted, or before Parent_D or Parent_A are rejected elsewhere and turn their attention to Nursery_B in later rounds.
