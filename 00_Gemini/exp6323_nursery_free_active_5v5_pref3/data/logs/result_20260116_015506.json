Parent_E (Rank 2) and Parent_C (Rank 3) have applied this round. While Parent_D (Rank 1) is my top choice, Parent_D lists Nursery_D as their last preference, making a future application unlikely. Parent_E is my second highest priority and has shown consistent interest. Securing a match with Parent_E now is the best move to maximize my priority score, as waiting for Parent_D is risky. I will accept Parent_E."

I have been rejected by Nursery_D (1st choice) twice and Nursery_A (2nd choice) once. Since the list of currently available nurseries is only ['Nursery_E'], and Nursery_E is my 5th and final preferred choice (but still preferred over being unmatched), I must now apply there.\nNursery_E ranks Parent_C as their 2nd highest priority. Given that Nursery_E is still unmatched, it is highly likely that their 1st choice (Parent_A) has matched elsewhere. Therefore, Parent_C has an excellent chance of being accepted by Nursery_E. I will send a formal application to secure this match immediately."

Parent_C has applied with a commitment ([APPLY]). Securing my second choice now is a strong outcome, mitigating the risk of being left with only lower-ranked parents (P_E, P_D) or being unmatched if Parent_C matches elsewhere.
