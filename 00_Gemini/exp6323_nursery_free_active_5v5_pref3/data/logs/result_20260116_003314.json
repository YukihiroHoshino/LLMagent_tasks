Although Parent_C is demonstrating extreme commitment by applying for the third time, accepting them now would prevent me from matching with any of the four higher-ranked parents (B, D, A, E). Since it is only Round 4 and I still have my full quota, I must prioritize keeping the slot open for Parent_D or Parent_B, who rank 2nd and 1st respectively. I previously rejected Parent_A (my 3rd priority), so settling for Parent_C now would be inconsistent with my strategy of holding out for higher priority candidates. I will reject Parent_C again."

Parent_C has been rejected multiple times by Nursery_A because Parent_C is the lowest priority applicant (5th) on Nursery_A's list. However, since the system indicates that only Nursery_A remains unmatched (capacity 1), it implies that all higher priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_E) must have matched with other nurseries (B, C, D, E), and Parent_C is the only remaining unmatched parent. In this terminal stage of the allocation, a match between the last remaining parent and the last remaining nursery is inevitable and stable. I must apply formally to secure the match."

Parent_C has applied persistently and is applying for the 5th time. Parent_C's message suggests that the market has cleared, and we are the last remaining pair ('the only remaining available parent, and with Nursery A being the only remaining available nursery'). If this assessment of the market is accurate, all four higher priority parents (Parent_B, Parent_D, Parent_A, Parent_E) are already matched and unavailable. Rejecting Parent_C now would guarantee remaining unmatched, which is worse than matching with the lowest available priority. Therefore, I must accept Parent_C to fulfill my quota."
