Parent_B prefers N_B, N_D, N_A. P_B is likely to apply to N_A since they are R1 there, or N_B (their #1 choice, but R3 priority). If P_B applies to N_A, I will be rejected.\n3. Analyze Nursery_C (Rank 1): I am R3 here. Rivals are Parent_C (R1) and Parent_B (R2). However, N_C is Parent_C's 4th preference and Parent_B's 5th preference. It is highly probable that P_C and P_B will apply to nurseries higher on their preference lists where they have better priority (e.g., P_B to N_A, P_C to N_D).\n\nIf P_C and P_B apply elsewhere, N_C will accept my application (P_D R3).\n\nSince this is Round 1, applying aggressively for my top choice, N_C, is warranted, based on the assumption that my high-priority competitors for N_C will prioritize their own higher preferences (D, A, B) over N_C.\n\nIf I am rejected, I can pivot to Nursery_A or the guaranteed Nursery_B in Round 2."

Parent_D is predicted to secure N_C. Parent_C is predicted to apply to N_D (P_C's 1st choice), but P_C is only 3rd on N_D's priority list.
