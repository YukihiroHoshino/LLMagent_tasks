D.\nNursery_C's Priorities: P_C (1st), P_B (2nd), P_D (3rd), P_E (4th), P_A (5th).\n\nAlthough I am 3rd priority for Nursery_C, the two parents ranked higher than me (P_C and P_B) rank Nursery_C very low (P_C ranks C 4th, P_B ranks C 5th). They are highly likely to apply to their own top choices (P_C -> D, P_B -> B).\n\nMy primary competition for C is Parent_E, who also ranks C first.
