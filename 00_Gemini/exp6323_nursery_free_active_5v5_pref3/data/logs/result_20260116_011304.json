My goal is to secure the highest possible match on my preference list: ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'].\n\nAnalyzing the market in Round 1, immediate matching based on priority is key. My priority rankings at my top preferences are low (C: 4th, B: 5th, A: 4th), making immediate acceptance unlikely as other parents with higher priority (P_D, P_B, P_C) are likely to apply to these schools.\n\nHowever, at Nursery_D (my 4th preference), I hold 2nd priority, which is my highest priority ranking across all nurseries (P_D > P_E > P_C > P_B > P_A).\n\nNursery D is the top choice for Parent C (R1, but P_C is 3rd priority at D). Nursery D is the 3rd choice for Parent D (R1, and P_D is 1st priority at D). Assuming P_D applies to their R1 choice (Nursery C) and P_C applies to their R1 choice (Nursery D), I have a strong advantage at D.\n\nIf P_C and P_E both apply to D, Nursery D must accept P_E (2nd priority) over P_C (3rd priority). This guarantees a match in Round 1, even if it is my 4th choice. This strategy prioritizes stability and securing a spot quickly, leveraging my highest priority position.\n\nI will formally apply to Nursery D."

N_B's priority list among the remaining parents (P_C, P_E) is P_C (2nd highest overall) > P_E (5th overall).
