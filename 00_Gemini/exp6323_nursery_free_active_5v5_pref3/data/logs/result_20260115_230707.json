If rejected, I risk being pushed down to my 5th choice (Nursery_E) in subsequent rounds, assuming all other high-priority parents secure matches.\n\n2. Analysis of Nursery_D (4th Choice): Nursery_D's priority list is ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_A']. I (Parent_E) am ranked 2nd highest priority at Nursery_D. \n\n3. Competition at Nursery_D: Parent_C lists D as their 1st choice and is likely to apply. However, Parent_C is only 3rd priority at D. If I apply to D, I beat Parent_C (P_E > P_C in priority).\n4. Competition at Nursery_D (P_D): Parent_D (1st priority at D) lists Nursery_C as their 1st choice. Since P_D also has higher priority than me at C, P_D will likely apply to C and be matched there, leaving D available for the next highest priority applicant (P_E).\n\nConclusion: Applying to Nursery_D (my 4th preference) guarantees a match in R1, which is a better outcome than the likely match with Nursery_E (5th preference) if I apply truthfully to C and get rejected. I will apply strategically to Nursery_D."
