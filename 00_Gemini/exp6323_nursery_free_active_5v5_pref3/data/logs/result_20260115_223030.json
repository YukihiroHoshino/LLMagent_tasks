Since Nursery_D is the only nursery listed as 'not yet matched' in Round 4, I must conclude that C, B, and A are already matched to other parents, making D the highest available preference for me. Although I have a provisional match, the system requires interaction. I will send a final [APPLY] to Nursery_D to cement the placement, interpreting the listing of D as an indication that the match needs final confirmation."

Parent_E is my second highest priority (Rank 2). In the previous round (R3), I extended an offer to Parent_E, and they are now submitting their final acceptance ([APPLY]). Although Parent_D (Rank 1) has not applied, Parent_D ranks me last (5th), making a match highly unlikely. Securing Parent_E (Rank 2) immediately is optimal, as it fulfills my quota (1) with a highly desired candidate. I must finalize the agreement by sending [ACCEPT]."
