All my top three preferences (Nursery_B, Nursery_D, Nursery_A) are now matched, as they are not on the active list. Only Nursery_E remains available, which is my 4th preference. Since securing a spot is crucial and Nursery_E is still a preferred option over being unmatched, I must formally apply now. Given that we are in Round 4 and Nursery_E is still open, it is highly probable that its higher priority parents (Parent_A and Parent_C) have matched elsewhere. Parent_B is the 3rd priority for Nursery_E. I will submit a strong application."

Parent_B is my third highest priority. My quota is 1.\nParent_A and Parent_C both rank Nursery_E as their absolute last choice (5th). It is highly unlikely they will apply to me unless they are rejected by all four nurseries they prefer over me. Waiting for them carries a high risk of being left unmatched or having to accept a lower-ranked parent (Parent_E or Parent_D).\nParent_B has applied with an [APPLY] tag. Since Parent_B is a strong candidate (3rd rank) and securing this spot guarantees a high-quality match given the market structure, I should accept this offer immediately to maximize my outcome and fill my quota."
