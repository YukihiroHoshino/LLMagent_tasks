The history confirms that Nursery_D (1st choice) and Nursery_A (2nd choice) are matched and unavailable. The 'List of nurseries not yet matched' contains only ['Nursery_E']. This means Nursery_B (3rd) and Nursery_C (4th) are also unavailable/matched.\n\nNursery_E is my 5th and final choice. Since matching with E is preferred over remaining unmatched, and it is the last available option on my list, I must formally apply ([APPLY]) immediately to secure the spot before another parent does."

My quota is 1, and I currently have no matches. While Parent_A (P1) is preferred, Parent_A ranks Nursery_E last, making their application unlikely unless the market is highly competitive and they have exhausted all other options. Accepting Parent_C (P2) secures a very high-ranking match immediately. This is a favorable outcome for Nursery_E."
