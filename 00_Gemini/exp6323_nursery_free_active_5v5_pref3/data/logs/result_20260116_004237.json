Parent_E (Rank 4) has also not applied. If Parent_E was rejected by their top two choices (C and B, where they ranked low), they should have applied to me (A) by now. Their continued absence suggests they are either matched or inactive.\n\nGiven the late stage of the allocation process (Round 6) and the high certainty that the four higher-ranked candidates are unavailable, continuing to reject Parent_C risks remaining unmatched entirely.
