A well-established result in market design theory is that the proposing side (Parents) cannot strictly improve their outcome by submitting a preference list that differs from their true preferences, provided the mechanism finds a stable matching relative to the submitted lists. This is known as strategyproofness for the proposing side. 

1. Initial DA Simulation (True Preferences: ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E']): The stable matching results in Parent_A being matched with Nursery_E (Rank 5). 
2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): This step involves automatic waivers and rerunning the DA algorithm if temporary admissions lead to 'blocking parents.' While this modifies the input lists of agents who block others, it does not provide a strategic opportunity for Parent_A to achieve a rank higher than the P-optimal stable matching outcome (Nursery_E), which is determined by the true priorities and preferences of all agents.

The standard DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents), meaning submitting true preferences yields the best possible outcome relative to the resulting stable matching (M_TPL).

However, this mechanism includes a complex Part 2 designed to eliminate 'blocking parents' by iteratively modifying the submitted preference lists of others. This modification means the final stable matching (M*) might not be M_TPL, but rather a stable matching relative to the modified lists (S*).

1. Initial DA Simulation (All submit True Preferences, TPLs):
If all parents submit TPLs, the initial stable matching (M_TPL) results in P_B -> N_B (Rank 1).

2. Part 2 Analysis (Waiver Iteration):
We track temporary admissions that cause rejections but differ from the final match (blocking parents). This led to waivers for P_D (N_C removed) and P_A (N_B removed) over two iterations.

3. Final Stable Outcome (M*):
After all waivers are applied, the process converges to a stable matching M* where:
P_A -> N_E (Rank 5)
P_B -> N_A (Rank 3)
P_C -> N_D (Rank 1)
P_D -> N_B (Rank 3)
P_E -> N_C (Rank 1)

If Parent_B submits their TPL, they achieve N_A (Rank 3).

4. Strategic Check:
We tested misrepresenting preferences (e.g., proposing N_D or N_A first). In both cases, the set of induced waivers applied to P_A and P_D remained the same, leading the overall process back to the same final outcome M*, where P_B is matched with N_A (Rank 3).

Since Parent_B cannot beat P_D for N_B (P_D has higher priority and secures N_B in M*), and no manipulation tested yielded a better result than N_A (Rank 3), the optimal strategy is to submit the True Preference List, maximizing the chance of securing the highest ranked school before waivers occur, and avoiding risks associated with misrepresentation in a complex, non-standard system.",True,Nursery_A,False,False,3

1. Initial DA (using true preferences for all): Parent_C matches with Nursery_C (4th choice).
2. Part 2 identifies blocking parents (A, B, D) who temporarily held seats and moved, restricting their lists.
3. DA Rerun (Iteration 2): With the restricted lists, the new stable match results in Parent_C matching with Nursery_D (1st choice).

1. Initial Simulation (Truthful Submission L_E = T = ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E']): The P-DA mechanism leads to Parent_E being matched to Nursery_D (Rank 4). Crucially, this run generates multiple blocking parents (P_A, P_B, P_D) and specifically ensures that P_D temporarily holds N_C but is later rejected, and P_E temporarily holds N_D, rejecting P_C.
2. BP Adjustment 1: P_A, P_B, and P_D must waive certain nurseries (N_A, N_B, N_C). This significantly alters their preference lists (T'').
3. Rerun Part 1 (with T''): With the higher-priority parents having their top choices (N_A, N_C) removed from their lists, the allocation shifts dramatically.

1. Initial Simulation (Assuming True Preferences submitted by all agents, including Parent E):
Submitting the full True Preference List (TP) led to an initial stable matching (M_TP) where Parent E was matched with Nursery A (Rank 3).

2. Blocking Check (Part 2):
Analyzing the steps leading to M_TP, several parents were identified as 'blocking parents,' including Parent E (at Nursery D, because E's temporary admission in Round 4 caused Parent C to be rejected, but E ultimately matched elsewhere).

3. Waivers and Rerun:
The blocking mechanism automatically enforced waivers for all blocking parents. Parent E's list was automatically truncated by removing Nursery D, resulting in the list: ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E']. Crucially, other key waivers occurred (e.g., Parent D waived Nursery C and A, Parent B waived Nursery A).

2. Blocking Check (M1): Parent_D is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_C because P_D temporarily displaced P_E but was later rejected by P_C, ending up at N_E. This triggers the removal of N_C from P_D's list.
3. Rerun DA (M2): With P_D's list modified, P_D applies to N_A first, displacing P_A. P_A is forced down the list and eventually accepts N_E (5th choice).
4. Blocking Check (M2): Parent_A is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_B (k=4) because P_A temporarily displaced P_B but moved to N_E. This triggers the removal of N_B from P_A's list.

Conclusion: Since N_C is blocked by a higher priority parent (P_C), N_A (Rank 2) is the best attainable outcome.

While the blocking parent phase (Part 2) complicates the analysis by dynamically restricting preference lists, the core principle holds: the best outcome a parent can achieve is the highest ranked school on their true preference list that is stable against the preferences of all other agents, given their priorities.

1. Initial DA simulation (using true preferences for all agents) yields a stable outcome (M_SDA) where Parent_B gets Nursery_A (3rd choice).

2. Strategic Submission: To improve the outcome, Parent_C needs to manipulate the initial application flow to trigger the blocking parent mechanism for competitors (P_A, P_D) who are highly ranked by P_C's preferred schools (N_D, N_A).

3. Submitted List: [Nursery_A, Nursery_D, Nursery_B, Nursery_C, Nursery_E].

2. Blocking Parent Correction (Part 2): The history leading to M1 identifies Parent A and Parent D as blocking parents, forcing the system to remove specific nurseries from their lists (e.g., A loses C_B, D loses C_C after the first rerun).
3. Rerunning DA with modified lists: When P_D removes C_C from their list and P_A removes C_B, Parent D proposes C_A instead of C_C in Step 1. This allows Parent E (who proposes C_C truthfully) to be admitted to C_C immediately in the Rerun 2 process.
4. Final Outcome: The resulting match M3 = {(D, C_A), (B, C_B), (E, C_C), (C, C_D), (A, C_E)} is stable under the correction rules, and Parent E achieves a match with Nursery C (Rank 1).

I tested alternative submitted lists for P_A, prioritizing high-priority schools (like B or E), but these attempts either secured E immediately or led to the same pattern of blocking parents and waivers, ultimately resulting in the same final assignment P_A -> E.

However, the rule explicitly states that this waiver 'will never change your final admission.' Therefore, the strategic goal remains solely focused on maximizing the outcome achieved in Part 1 (the DAA phase).

By submitting the true preference list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'], Parent E attempts their highest preferences first, utilizing their relative priorities effectively:
1. E applies to N_C (rejected by D, due to D having higher priority).

Since Parent_A has very low priority at their highly preferred schools (A, C, D) and is only 2nd priority at B (beaten by Parent_D), Parent_A is severely constrained in achieving a high-ranked match.

1. Analysis of outcomes: Simulations show that regardless of initial strategic misrepresentation (e.g., proposing B first, or E first), Parent_A consistently ends up matched with Nursery_E (5th choice). This is because Parent_D has higher priority at N_B, and Parent_A has the lowest priority at N_C and N_D. Any attempt by Parent_A to secure a higher ranked school (A, C, D, B) results in Parent_A being rejected by higher priority parents (D or B) before the end of Part 1.
2. Role of Part 2: The Part 2 process eliminates justified envy caused by specific temporary matches, leading to mandatory waivers. If Parent_A submits truthfully ([A, C, D, B, E]), the system forces Parent_A to waive B, resulting in the final stable outcome M'(A)=E. If Parent_A submits strategically to secure B first ([B, A, C, D, E]), Parent_A is still rejected from B by D, and Parent_A is identified as a blocking parent at B, resulting in the same waiver.
3. Maximizing rank: Since the stable outcome for Parent_A appears to be fixed at Nursery_E, the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list. Submitting the true list ensures that Parent_A proposes to all preferred schools in the correct order, maximizing the likelihood of achieving the highest possible rank (E) and avoiding the risk of remaining unmatched (which would happen if E was omitted or ranked too low and the process terminated early).

Crucially, in this run, Parent_B is temporarily admitted at Nursery_B (Rank 1) in earlier rounds (R2, R6) but is later rejected, ending up at A. Since M(Parent_B) = A, Parent_B is identified as a 'blocking parent' at Nursery_B, causing Nursery_B to be automatically waived from Parent_B's list in Part 2.
2. Achievability Check: Due to the high priority of Parent_D (1st) and Parent_A (2nd) at Nursery_B, and Parent_D's inability to secure their top choices (C or A), Parent_D ultimately settles at B, preventing Parent_B from obtaining Rank 1. Similarly, Rank 2 (D) is occupied by higher priority parents. Rank 3 (A) is the highest stable outcome achievable for Parent_B.
3. Strategic Submission: To secure the best achievable outcome (A, Rank 3) while avoiding the penalty of losing the most preferred option (B) in the iterative Part 2 process, Parent_B should strategically prioritize A.

1. True Preferences Submission (L_D = ['N_C', 'N_A', 'N_B', 'N_E', 'N_D']):

Parent_A is matched with Nursery_A, which is their 1st choice.

2. Checking Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
The mechanism checks for blocking parents (P) who were temporarily admitted at N, caused a rejection, but ultimately moved away (M[P] != N). In the resulting matching M1, Parent_A's temporary admission at N_A (R1, R3) was their final admission (M[A]=N_A). Similarly, all other parents whose temporary admissions caused rejections ended up matched to those nurseries (e.g., P_D at N_C, P_E at N_D, P_B at N_B). Therefore, no blocking parents are found.

2. I then executed Part 2 (Blocking Parent removal) and reran DA twice, resulting in the final stable match F'' = {(A, E), (B, A), (C, D), (D, B), (E, C)}. Parent_B still matched with N_A (3rd choice).

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission: If Parent_A submits their true list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], the initial DA yields (Parent_A, Nursery_A), Rank 1.

2. Strategy to Manipulate Waivers: To improve the outcome, Parent_A must prevent the sequence of events that leads to Parent_D receiving Nursery_A in the rerun. This means preventing Parent_D from becoming a blocking parent at Nursery_C in the initial run, which occurs because Parent_D is rejected from N_C by Parent_C.

This modification does not generally incentivize the proposing parent (Parent_A) to misrepresent their preferences, as the mechanism is designed to stabilize the outcome further.

I simulated the process using Parent_A's true preferences ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'].

This strongly indicates that strategic misrepresentation will not benefit Parent_B, as Parent_B's best attainable stable match based on their true preferences is protected. 

Analysis of the stable matching using all true preferences shows Parent_B is matched with Nursery_A (3rd choice).

1. **Analyze Truthful Submission (P_E: [N_C, N_B, N_A, N_D, N_E]):** In the initial DA run (M_T), Parent_E is rejected by N_C in Round 1 because Parent_D has higher priority. Parent_E eventually matches with N_D (Rank 4).
2. **Analyze Stability (Part 2):** Parent_D was temporarily admitted to N_C (R1), causing Parent_E's rejection, but D ultimately matched with N_E. This makes Parent_D a 'blocking parent' at N_C, forcing D to waive N_C (and N_A).
3. **Analyze Rerun:** When DA is rerun with P_D waiving N_C, Parent_E applies to N_C first and secures the position, resulting in a final match of N_C (Rank 1).

4. Furthermore, since P_D's temporary admission (Step 1, N_C) is also their final admission (N_C), P_D does not become a 'blocking parent' under the rules of Part 2. Therefore, the resulting match is stable and final, securing N_C for Parent_D.",True,Nursery_B,False,False,3

Analysis showed that if Parent_A submits their true preference list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], Parent_A is initially matched to N_A (1st choice) in Part 1 (M1).

Extensive testing of manipulated lists designed to prevent the blocking parent issue (by ensuring Parent_D matches N_C or Parent_A avoids N_A) consistently resulted in Parent_A being matched to N_E (5th choice), either because the manipulation failed to prevent the blocking parent and led to the N_E outcome in the rerun, or because the manipulation resulted in a stable outcome where Parent_A was matched to N_E directly.

The Part 2 mechanism then removes N_A from P_D's list and reruns the procedure, forcing the final outcome back to Nursery_B.

3. Conclusion:
   Since the Part 2 mechanism effectively penalizes strategic proposals that temporarily block others and forces the outcome toward the established Parent-optimal stable match (Nursery_B), the best strategy remains submitting the full, true preference list. This ensures that Parent_D achieves their Rank 3 preference, which is the highest ranking outcome achievable in this stable market.",True,Nursery_C,False,True,1

1. Initial Run (Submitting TPL: [C, B, A, D, E]): Parent E matches with Nursery E (Rank 5). Parent E becomes a blocking parent at Nursery D (R4) because E temporarily admitted at D, rejected Parent C, but later moved to E. This forces the removal of D from E's list for the next iteration.

3. Optimal Strategy: Since the removal of D from E's list is required to bypass the initial blocking state and allow the necessary list reductions for other parents (specifically Parent D) to occur, Parent E should preemptively submit the list [C, B, A, E].

1. Analysis of True Preferences (C, A, B, E, D): If Parent_D submits the true preference list, simulation shows that D temporarily matches with C (1st choice) and is later rejected, and D eventually matches with E (4th choice). D becomes a blocking parent at C. This triggers the removal of C from D's list. A subsequent rerun (Rerun 1) shows D temporarily matching with A (2nd choice) and eventually matching with B (3rd choice). D becomes a blocking parent at A, triggering the removal of A. A final rerun (Rerun 2) with the truncated list (B, E, D) results in D matching with B (3rd choice), which is stable for D.

2. Optimal Strategy: Since attempts to secure C or A lead to D becoming a blocking parent and having those nurseries removed from the list, the highest preference D can stably secure is B (D is ranked N1 at Nursery B).

Since Parent_D is the highest priority applicant (N1) for Nursery B, D is provisionally admitted and remains matched with B throughout the process.

In markets where quotas are 1 (as here), the DA algorithm yields a unique stable matching (M*).

1. Calculate the outcome using True Preferences (Parent-Proposing DA):
   The standard DA outcome (M_DA) using the true preferences is M_DA = {(A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D)}. Parent_A is matched to Nursery_E (5th choice).

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check):
   In M_DA, Parent_A temporarily blocked N_B (R11) but ended up at N_E. Parent_D temporarily blocked N_C (R1) and N_A (R8) but ended up at N_B. This triggers waivers: A must waive B; D must waive C and A.

3. Rerun DA with Waivers:
   When DA is rerun with the modified lists (L1), the system converges to a new stable matching, M_1 = {(A, E), (B, A), (C, D), (D, B), (E, C)}. This matching M_1 is stable and contains no blocking parents, thus becoming the final outcome. Parent_A still receives N_E.

4. Strategic Consideration:
   Since the final outcome (N_E) is the unique stable match for Parent_A, any attempt to strategically reorder preferences (e.g., prioritizing B) or truncate the list (e.g., excluding E) would either result in the same stable outcome after waivers are forced, or lead to a worse outcome (e.g., being unmatched, which is dispreferred to N_E).

Conclusion: Submitting the true preferences is the strategy that maximizes Parent_A's utility under the constraint of stability enforced by the mechanism. Although the outcome is the 5th choice (N_E), it is the best achievable stable match.",True,Nursery_E,False,False,5

A key property of this mechanism is that it is strategy-proof for the proposing side (the Parents). This means that submitting one's true preferences guarantees the best possible stable match for the parent among all stable matchings. 

1. Identify the P-Optimal Stable Match: I must first determine the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences.
   - Parent_B (P_B) prefers B > D > A > E > C.
   - Simulation shows that P_D (highest priority at B) secures Nursery_B, and P_E (higher priority than P_B at D) secures Nursery_D. 
   - P_B ultimately secures Nursery_A (3rd choice) in the stable matching (A -> P_B, B -> P_D, C -> P_C, D -> P_E, E -> P_A).

2. Evaluate Manipulation: Since DA is strategy-proof, any attempt to misrepresent preferences (e.g., swapping B and D, or omitting A) is theoretically guaranteed to result in an outcome worse than or equal to the truthful outcome (Nursery_A).

3. Evaluate Part 2 (Blocking Parent Resolution): The Part 2 rule forces a parent identified as 'blocking' to waive the nursery and reruns the DA process. If Parent_B submits truthfully and is identified as blocking at A and B, the subsequent rerun yields Nursery_E (4th choice), which is worse than A. However, the instructions explicitly state: 'This automatic waiver will never change your final admission.' This suggests that the mechanism aims to preserve the parent's best stable outcome (A) while resolving blocking issues for other agents. Therefore, relying on the mechanism's guarantee of strategy-proofness and the explicit note, submitting true preferences remains the optimal strategy to maximize the guaranteed outcome (Nursery_A).",True,Nursery_A,False,False,3

1. P_A was forced to waive N_B. Rerun 1 resulted in M(P_C) = N_C.
2. P_D was then forced to waive N_C. Rerun 2 resulted in M(P_C) = N_D (1st choice).

Since the final outcome resulting from the mechanism operating on the true preferences yields the highest possible choice (Nursery_D) for Parent_C, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.

N_A (Rank 2) is the best achievable outcome for P_D, as N_C (Rank 1) is ultimately claimed by P_C (who has higher priority at N_C than P_D).

1. Analysis of Part 1 (Standard DA with True Preferences): Running the DA algorithm using all parents' true preferences results in a matching M where Parent_E is matched to Nursery_D (4th choice). Crucially, due to priority constraints (P_D beats P_E at N_C, P_B beats P_E at N_B, P_A beats P_E at N_A), Parent_E cannot secure their 1st (N_C) or 2nd (N_B) choice by proposing them first.

3. Strategic Consideration: Since the Part 1 outcome (M) and the subsequent identification of blocking parents depend on the overall market structure and priority rankings, Parent_E's initial submission order only affects the sequence of their own rejections in the early rounds, not the final stable outcome M2, as P_A, P_B, P_C, and P_D are highly ranked at their top choices.

3. Second Run (Part 1 Rerun) with Revised Lists:
The system reruns the DAA with the revised lists. In this iteration, Parent_C applies to N_D (Rank 1). N_D's priority list is [P_D, P_E, P_C, P_B, P_A].

- R2: P_B applies to N_D but is rejected (P_C has higher priority).
- P_C holds N_D until the end of Part 1.

4. Final Outcome:

1. Initial DA Run (using true preferences): I analyzed the DA process using Parent_D's true preference list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D']. The process ends with Parent_D matching with Nursery_B (Rank 3).
2. Stability Check: I confirmed that Parent_D cannot obtain a higher ranked nursery (N_C or N_A) because they are rejected by parents with higher priority at those nurseries (P_C at N_C, P_B at N_A). Thus, N_B is Parent_D's highest stable match.
3. Part 2 Impact: When running the initial DA, Parent_D temporarily held seats at N_C and N_A before ultimately matching with N_B.

   The simulation showed that the stable matching M_S = { (P_B, N_A), (P_D, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_E, N_D), (P_A, N_E) } is reached. Parent E (P_E) receives Nursery D (Rank 4).

2. Part 2 Correction Analysis:
   We identified several parents who were temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but ended up elsewhere (e.g., P_A at N_A/N_B, P_D at N_C, P_B at N_B). The last such event (R9: P_A blocking at N_B) triggered the first waiver (P_A waives N_B).
   Rerunning Part 1 (Iteration 1) resulted in a new outcome where P_E still received N_D. This outcome, however, still contained a blocking parent (P_A blocking at N_A, R3). P_A was then forced to waive N_A.
   Rerunning Part 1 (Iteration 2) with both N_A and N_B removed from P_A's list resulted in the final matching M''_{DA} = { (P_E, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_D, N_C), (P_C, N_D), (P_A, N_E) }. In this final outcome, P_E secured Nursery A (Rank 3).

1. Simulation of True Preferences (TPL): Running DA with all parents submitting their True Preference Lists (TPL) resulted in the stable matching M_S = {(P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_B), (P_E, N_D)}. Parent_D matched with N_B (Rank 3).

Parent_D is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_C (D was temporarily admitted at C, rejected E, but eventually moved to E, which D prefers less than C). This triggers Rerun 1, where D must waive C.

1. Analyzing Nursery_C (Rank 1):
Nursery_C prioritizes Parent_C (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2) above Parent_D (Rank 3). If Parent_C fails to secure their top three choices (N_D, N_A, N_B), they will propose to N_C and displace Parent_D, regardless of Parent_D's initial proposal.

2. True Preference Submission Analysis:
If I submit ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', ...], I temporarily secure N_C in Round 1, but I am later rejected by Parent_C (R7).

3. Strategic Submission Analysis:
To secure a high rank and avoid the Part 2 penalty, I must stabilize the market such that Parent_C secures a higher preference, preventing them from proposing to N_C. Parent_C's 1st choice is N_D. If Parent_D proposes to N_A (Rank 2) first, P_D wins the temporary seat at N_A over P_A (P_D > P_A at N_A).

When P_D submits [N_A, N_C, N_B, N_E, N_D]:
In Round 1, P_C proposes to N_D and P_E proposes to N_C. Both are accepted temporarily. Since P_C and P_E are matched to their respective first choices (N_D and N_C), they do not propose down their lists to N_C/N_D later, thus stabilizing the assignments for N_C and N_D.

In this scenario, P_D secures N_A (True Rank 2), and no blocking parents are created.

1. Initial DA Run (Assuming all agents submit true preferences):
   The initial run resulted in Parent E matching with Nursery D (4th choice), due to higher-priority parents (P_D, P_B, P_A) preempting N_C, N_B, and N_A.

2. Part 2 Analysis (Blocking Parent Removal):
   The initial outcome (M) had P_D blocking at N_C (R1, P_D was TA at N_C but moved to N_E). N_C was removed from P_D's list.

3. Rerun 1:
   With P_D's list waived of N_C, the DA algorithm reran. This time, P_E was matched with N_C in Round 1 (P_D applied to N_A instead). The final outcome (M') resulted in P_E matching N_C (1st choice).

4. Rerun 2 Check:
   M' resulted in P_D blocking at N_A (R1') and P_A blocking at N_B (R4'). The latter (P_A blocking at N_B) was the latest blocking event. N_B was removed from P_A's list.

The process converges to a final stable matching where Parent_D is matched with Nursery_A (Rank 2). This outcome is superior to the Rank 3 match achieved in the simple P-OSM.
3. Strategic Manipulation Check: Attempts to manipulate by ranking lower choices higher (e.g., placing N_A or N_D first) resulted in a final outcome of Nursery_B (Rank 3), which is worse than the Rank 2 outcome achieved by reporting truthfully and allowing the correction mechanism to operate.

   - Round 1: Parent_D proposes to N_C. N_C receives applications from D and E. N_C prefers D over E (D > E). D is T.A. at N_C.
   - The process continues until all parents are matched (A->N_A, B->N_B, C->N_E, D->N_C, E->N_D).
   - Parent_D is matched with N_C, which is Parent_D's Rank 1 choice.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents Check):
   - A blocking parent must have caused a rejection during a temporary admission (Prevention) and then moved away (Discrepancy).
   - In the simulation, Parent_D was T.A. at N_C and remained there (Final Admission = N_C). Thus, Parent_D is not a blocking parent.
   - Checking other parents reveals no instances where a T.A. caused a rejection and the T.A. parent subsequently moved away. Therefore, the matching found in Part 1 is the final, stable assignment.

Since submitting my true preferences yields a match with my highest ranked nursery (N_C), no strategic misreporting can improve this outcome. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,Nursery_B,False,False,3

1. Initial Run (using T = ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E']): The PPDA process results in Parent_E being unmatched (U). 
2. Part 2 Check: Parent_E was temporarily admitted to Nursery_D in Round 4, causing Parent_C to be rejected, but Parent_E ultimately ended up unmatched (U). This classifies Parent_E as a blocking parent at Nursery_D. The system forces Parent_E to waive Nursery_D.
3. Rerun (using T' = ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E']): Rerunning PPDA with the waived list leads to Parent_E matching with Nursery_E (Rank 4).

Analysis of Manipulation: Parent_E has low priority (P4 or P5) at their top three choices (C, B, A) and would be rejected by higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) who apply early. Parent_E's highest priority is P2 at Nursery_D, but securing D leads to instability due to Parent_D having P1 priority there, eventually displacing E.

1. Initial DA Run (TPL Submitted: [A, C, D, B, E]): Parent_A matched to Nursery_E (Rank 5). This is the worst outcome. This run generated multiple Blocking Parents (P_D at N_A and N_C, P_A at N_B).

2. Strategic Analysis: Parent_A faces high competition, especially from P_D (1st at B, 2nd at A) and P_B (1st at A, 3rd at B). To secure their top choice (Nursery_A), Parent_A needs P_D and P_B to waive N_A.

3. Strategic Submission ([C, D, B, A, E]): By prioritizing lower preference, high-rejection schools (C, D) and the achievable school (B) over their true top choice (A), Parent_A changes the initial flow of applications.

2. Blocking Parent Analysis (Part 2): In the trace leading to M1, Parent D temporarily held N_C (Round 1, rejecting P_E) but ultimately matched N_D. Thus, P_D is a Blocking Parent (BP) at N_C. P_E was also found to be a BP at N_D (Round 4, rejecting P_C).

3. Rerun DA: The adjustment removes the blocking nursery from the BP's list (starting with the latest blocking step, P_E waiving N_D).

4. Final Stability Check: M2 is checked for blocking parents. Since P_D's temporary match at N_C (Round 1) now equals their final match (N_C), P_D is no longer a BP. No other blocking parents are found. M2 is the final outcome.

While the addition of Part 2 complicates the overall strategy space, the core optimization principle remains: Parent_A must submit a list that maximizes the chance of securing the highest ranked match possible in the initial DA run, as this provides the best starting point.

1. Initial DA run with truthful preferences ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'] yields $M_1 = \{(P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_E), (P_E, N_D)\}$. Parent_A secures $N_A$ (Rank 1).

Simulating the full process using everyone's TPL shows:
1. Initial DA (Part 1, Iteration 1) yields M1: P_B matches N_A (3rd choice).
2. Blocking analysis forces P_A to waive N_B and P_D to waive N_C and N_A (though only the latest block matters for the first waiver step, subsequent waivers occur iteratively).
3. Rerunning DA with the first forced waiver (P_A waives N_B) leads to M2, where P_B matches N_B (1st choice).

3. Strategic Submission: P_B's first choice is N_B. P_D is the highest priority parent at N_B (D > A > B). If P_D applies to N_B first, P_D secures N_B, P_B is rejected, and P_B then applies to N_A (where P_B is highest priority) and displaces P_D. This yields N_B (Rank 3).

3. Reruns: The waivers (P_A waives N_B, P_D waives N_C) fundamentally change the subsequent DA runs. By Rerun 2, Parent_D applies to N_A first, and Parent_E secures N_C early, preventing E from applying to N_D and subsequently rejecting C.
4. Final Outcome: After Rerun 2, the match is confirmed as stable with no blocking parents. Parent_C is matched with Nursery_D (1st choice).

1. Analysis of Truthful Reporting (TR): If Parent_A submits the true preference list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], the Part 1 outcome M_S results in Parent_A matching with Nursery_A (Rank 1).

2. Blocking Parent Check: Since $P_D$ was temporarily admitted to $N_C$ (rejecting $P_E$) but ended up at $N_B$, $P_D$ is identified as a Blocking Parent at $N_C$. This triggers the waiver of $N_C$ from $P_D$'s list in Part 2.

1. Analysis of Top Choices (N_B and N_D):
   - Nursery_B (Rank 1): Parent_D (Prio 1) and Parent_A (Prio 2) have higher priority than Parent_B (Prio 3).
   - Nursery_D (Rank 2): Parent_D (Prio 1), Parent_E (Prio 2), and Parent_C (Prio 3) have higher priority than Parent_B (Prio 4).

2. Simulation using True Preferences (L1):
   The stable matching (M1) resulted in P_B matching with N_A (Rank 3). Crucially, the subsequent waiver process (Part 2) was primarily driven by Parent_D and Parent_A blocking at their high-preference schools, leading them to waive N_C and N_A (for P_D) and N_A and N_B (for P_A).

3. Rerun Matching (M_final, using L2/L3 lists):

In standard DA, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents). I must verify if the iterative waiver process in Part 2 changes this strategy for Parent_C.

1. Initial Run (R0) using True Preferences:
If all parents submit their true preferences, the stable matching (M0) results in: P_A->E, P_B->A, P_C->C, P_D->B, P_E->D. Parent_C receives N_C (4th choice).

2. Blocking Parent Analysis:
Checking M0 reveals multiple blocking parents. The last step where a blocking parent action occurred was R12, where P_E (T=N_D, F=N_D) caused P_B rejection. Wait, P_E's final match F=N_D. P_E was temporarily admitted at N_D (T=N_D) in R4, R10, R12. Since T=F, P_E is not blocking *if* T refers to the specific assignment where the parent landed. 

Let's recheck P_E (F=D). R12: P_E (T=D) rejects P_B. Since F=D, P_E is NOT blocking at N_D, as F=T. 

Let's recheck P_A (F=E). R11: P_A (T=B) rejects P_B. Since F=E, P_A is blocking at N_B. (T != F).

Let's assume P_A blocking at N_B (R11) is the last relevant block. P_A must waive N_B.

3. Rerunning DA (R1) with P_A waiving N_B:
If we follow the calculation in the thought process, we found that if P_E waived N_D (an earlier block), the resulting assignment (M1) was P_C -> N_D (1st choice). This outcome is highly favorable.

Since the mechanism is complex and iterative, but starts from the initial submissions, and the goal is to maximize P_C's rank, we rely on the standard DA intuition: submitting true preferences often leads to the highest possible stable rank, and any deviation risks a worse allocation that might not be improved by the subsequent waiver process.

Crucially, submitting the true list ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E'] is the only way to propose to Nursery_D (P_C's Rank 1) in the first round.

1. Analysis of Truthful Submission (P_D submits [N_C, N_A, N_B, N_E, N_D]):
   - Initial DAA (Part 1) results in P_D matching N_B (Rank 3), due to P_C displacing P_D from N_C, and P_B displacing P_D from N_A.
   - Part 2 identifies P_D as a blocking parent at N_C (R1 acceptance caused P_E rejection, P_D moved) and N_A (R8 acceptance caused P_A rejection, P_D moved). P_D is forced to waive N_C (their Rank 1) and N_A (if P_D was the latest blocker at N_A). However, based on the sequential nature of waivers, P_D waiving N_C and P_A waiving N_B occurs first.
   - Rerunning Part 1 after waivers (P_A waives N_B, P_D waives N_C) leads to the final stable matching where P_D matches N_A (Rank 2).

2. Analysis of Strategic Deviation (P_D submits [N_A, N_C, N_B, N_E, N_D]):
   - P_D attempts to get N_A first. Initial DAA results in P_D matching N_B (Rank 3).
   - Part 2 identifies P_D as a blocking parent at N_A and N_C. P_D is forced to waive both. P_D's list is reduced to [N_B, N_E, N_D].

Round 1 results in P_D temporarily matched to C. Eventually, P_C (Prio 1 for C) displaces P_D from C. P_D is then displaced from A by P_B (Prio 1 for A). P_D finally matches with B (Prio 1 for B).
The resulting stable matching M1 is: {(A, E), (B, D), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D)}.
Parent D's match is B, which is Rank 3 on the true preference list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'].

2. Strategy Check:
Since DA is strategy-proof, any attempt by Parent D to manipulate (e.g., submitting A or B first) will either yield the same outcome (B) or a worse outcome (a school D prefers less than B). For instance, if D applies to C first, D is rejected by P_C (C's Prio 1). If D applies to A first, D is rejected by P_B (A's Prio 1).

3. Impact of Part 2:
Part 2 removes nurseries where the parent was a blocking parent. Although my simulation shows that subsequent reruns based on modified lists might lead to a worse outcome for D (Rank 5), the mechanism explicitly guarantees: 'This automatic waiver will never change your final admission but may improve other Parents' final admissions.' This strongly implies that the final outcome for the parent who submits their true preferences is the POSM derived from those true preferences, regardless of the subsequent iterations aimed at eliminating blocking histories for other agents.

Therefore, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy to secure the Parent-Optimal Stable Matching, which is Nursery B (Rank 3).",True,Nursery_B,False,False,3

Therefore, the optimal strategy for Parent E is to submit their True Preference List. 

Running the DA process with truthful preferences reveals that Parent E is rejected by their top three choices (Nursery_C, Nursery_B, and Nursery_A) because higher-priority parents (D, B, and A, respectively) hold those spots and never move. Parent E eventually matches with Nursery_D (Rank 4), which is the highest rank achievable given the market constraints.",True,Nursery_C,False,False,1

The subsequent mechanism (Part 2) iteratively removes schools from a parent's list if that parent acted as a 'blocking parent' (temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but ultimately matched elsewhere). 

1. Initial DA Run (Truthful Submission [A, C, D, B, E]): The stable matching outcome is P_A -> N_E (Rank 5), P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_C, P_D -> N_B, P_E -> N_D.
2. Part 2 Check: In this run, P_A acted as a blocking parent at N_A (R3, R5) and N_B (R11), forcing the waivers of these schools. This iterative waiver process ultimately led to the final stable outcome: P_A -> N_E (Rank 5).
3. Manipulation Analysis: I tested several manipulated lists (e.g., placing low-priority schools like C or D first, or placing N_E first). In all cases where P_A tried to secure a higher-ranked school (A, C, D, B), P_A was either rejected early by a higher priority parent (avoiding BP status but still resulting in N_E) or acted as a BP, leading to the school being waived, and the final match settling at N_E (Rank 5).

Since the unique stable outcome for P_A based on market priorities is N_E, and the Part 2 mechanism actively prevents P_A from benefiting from applying to higher-ranked schools where they are low/medium priority, manipulation is ineffective and only risks truncating the list unnecessarily.

1. Initial DA (M1) using all true preferences: Parent_D matches with N_B (3rd choice). This matching identifies Parent_D as a blocking parent at N_C (for rejecting Parent E in R1 and moving elsewhere later). Parent_A is also a blocking parent at N_B.

2. Standard DA (Part 1) Outcome using True Preferences (Run 1): Submitting the true list [C, A, B, E, D] results in a final match M1 where D is matched with N_B (3rd choice). 

3. Blocking Parent Removal (Part 2): The mechanism iterates to eliminate blocking parents.

However, since the final stable match is unique, any initial truthful submission should lead to the optimal outcome if the process converges favorably.

1. Initial DAA (Truthful Submission): The standard DAA process results in the unique P-optimal stable match: (N_A, P_B), (N_B, P_D), (N_C, P_C), (N_D, P_E), (N_E, P_A). Parent_E (P_E) secures N_D (4th choice).

2. Part 2 Analysis: The initial match contains blocking parents (P_A and P_D) whose temporary admissions caused rejections but who moved schools. This triggers list modifications.

4. Rerun 2 (P_D's N_A removed, P_A's N_A removed): Further list modifications occur based on blocking parents identified in Rerun 1.

However, the Part 2 modification fundamentally changes the strategic landscape. When Parent_A submits their True Preferences [A, C, D, B, E] (Run 1), Parent_A temporarily secures A.

This triggers a sequence of forced waivers (P_D drops C, then A; P_A drops B) across subsequent P-DA runs (Run 2, Run 3).

Analysis showed that this cascade is robust: P_D's high priority at A and B, combined with the unavoidable rejection of P_D from C by P_C (who has highest priority at C but applies late), ensures that P_D is displaced and applies to A or B in modified runs, eventually displacing Parent_A.

Next, I tested manipulative lists (e.g., prioritizing C or D). In these manipulated scenarios, while P_A sometimes temporarily achieved a better outcome (Nursery B, 4th choice) in the first run of Part 1, this manipulation always caused other highly prioritized parents (specifically P_D) to become blocking parents at their preferred schools (A, C). When P_D's list was subsequently restricted, P_D secured Nursery B immediately (due to high priority), pushing P_A back to Nursery E in the final converged outcome (Run 2 of the manipulation). 

Since E is the stable outcome reached both truthfully and through attempted manipulation, and the mechanism penalizes manipulations that create temporary blockages for others, the optimal strategy for Parent_A is to submit their true preferences.",True,Nursery_E,False,False,5

1. Simulation with Truthful Preferences: I simulated the Parent-Proposing DA (Part 1) using all parents' true preference lists. The resulting stable matching (M_T) was: P_A -> N_E, P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_C, P_D -> N_B, P_E -> N_D. 
2. P_B's Outcome: Parent_B (P_B) matched with Nursery_A (N_A). According to P_B's true list ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C'], N_A is the Rank 3 choice.
3. Stability Check: I verified that M_T is stable with respect to all true preferences and priorities. Since N_A is the outcome of the Parent-Optimal stable matching for P_B, no strategic misrepresentation can yield a strictly better outcome (Rank 1 or Rank 2).
4. Part 2 Consideration: The blocking parent adjustment (Part 2) explicitly states that the automatic waiver will 'never change your final admission' (P_B's final match). Therefore, P_B should focus purely on maximizing the outcome in Part 1, which is achieved by submitting the truthful list to guarantee the P-Optimal stable match (Rank 3).

If Parent E submits the true list, P_E proposes to N_C first. P_D also proposes N_C and has higher priority (P_D 3rd, P_E 4th). P_D is accepted, and P_E is rejected. This interaction is key: P_D's temporary acceptance caused P_E's rejection.
In this initial stable matching (M0), P_E receives N_D (Rank 4), and P_D receives N_E (Rank 4 on P_D's list).

2. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2):
Since P_D was temporarily admitted at N_C, rejected P_E, but ultimately matched elsewhere (N_E), P_D is identified as a blocking Parent at N_C. P_D is forced to waive N_C.

3. Reruns:
The procedure reruns with P_D's modified list. As demonstrated in the simulation, this chain reaction (P_D waiving N_C, then further waivers) eventually leads to a final stable matching (M_final) where Parent E is matched with Nursery C (Rank 1).

4. Strategic Deviation Analysis:
If Parent E deviates (e.g., by ranking N_D first), P_E would immediately match N_D in Step 1. In this scenario, P_D's temporary acceptance at N_C would not have caused P_E's rejection (P_E was already matched). P_D would not be identified as a blocking parent at N_C, N_C would not be waived, and P_E would likely remain matched to N_D (Rank 4). 

Conclusion: Submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy because it intentionally triggers the initial rejection necessary to identify P_D as a blocking parent, leading to the beneficial waiver sequence and the highest possible match (N_C, Rank 1) for Parent E.",True,Nursery_C,False,False,1

1. Standard DA (Part 1) is strategy-proof for the proposing side (parents), guaranteeing the Parent-optimal stable matching (P-OSM) when submitting true preferences. For Parent_A's true list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], the P-OSM is M*: (A, E), (B, A), (C, C), (D, B), (E, D), resulting in Parent_A getting Nursery_E (Rank 5).
2. The correction phase (Part 2) is triggered by the pathway of temporary admissions. When Parent_A submits the true list, the iterative process leads to sequential waivers:
    - Iteration 1: Parent_A waives Nursery_B.
    - Iteration 2: Parent_A waives Nursery_A.
    The final stable matching for the reduced market (M2) results in Parent_A being matched with Nursery_E (Rank 5).
3. Testing strategic deviations (e.g., swapping Rank 1 and 2, or prioritizing Rank 3) yields the exact same Part 1 outcome (M*) or an outcome (M1 or M2) that still results in the same Rank 5 assignment after Part 2 iterations.

This iterative list reduction process moves the final allocation towards a matching that is stable regarding both the original preferences and the history of temporary rejections.

1. Analysis of True Preference List (TPL) Submission: If Parent_A submits their TPL [A, C, D, B, E], the initial DA run (Part 1) yields a stable matching $M_1$: (P_A -> E, P_B -> A, P_C -> C, P_D -> B, P_E -> D). However, the history shows blocking parents (P_A at B, P_D at C). Part 2 forces the removal of B from P_A's list and C from P_D's list, leading to a rerun of DA. This rerun stabilizes at a final matching $M^*$: (P_A -> E, P_B -> B, P_C -> D, P_D -> A, P_E -> C).
2. Result: Parent_A achieves Nursery E (Rank 5).
3. Strategic Consideration: Since P_A has low priority (3rd at A, 5th at C/D, 2nd at B) relative to other parents who value P_A's top choices highly, P_A is constrained by these priority rankings. Any attempt to prioritize a higher ranked school (e.g., B) that P_A ultimately cannot hold (due to being rejected by higher priority P_D at B, or P_D/P_B at A) risks creating a temporary blocking scenario. As demonstrated in a test manipulation (prioritizing B), the blocking parent rule in Part 2 tends to eventually remove the manipulated choice and revert the outcome to the final stable matching ($M^*$) anyway. 

Given that the mechanism appears robust and steers the outcome toward a stable matching where P_A is heavily constrained by priority, submitting the True Preference List is the safest and optimal strategy, as manipulation is unlikely to improve the outcome and may only complicate the process without benefit.",True,Nursery_E,False,False,5

Final stable matching M: A->A, B->B, C->E, D->C, E->D.

Next, I checked for blocking parents (Part 2). A parent P is blocking at N if P was temporarily admitted at N (causing rejections) but P's final match M(P) is not N.

1. Analyze True Preference List (TPL) outcome: If Parent_D submits TPL ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the initial stable match (M) is N_B (Rank 3).

    * After multiple iterations of Part 2 waivers imposed on D and A, the final outcome when submitting TPL is N_A (Rank 2).

2. Analyze Strategic List (Waiver of N_C): Parent_D suspects that applying to N_C first, where they have low priority but can displace others, leads to the complex Part 2 process. By submitting ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], Parent_D applies directly to N_A (Rank 2).
    * Parent_D has the 2nd highest priority at N_A (after Parent_B). Parent_A applies to N_A first (3rd priority). Parent_D applies to N_A first on the strategic list.
    * Simulation (similar to Iteration 3): D applies to N_A and is temporarily admitted, rejecting A (who has lower priority than D). D remains matched at N_A throughout Part 1.
    * Since D secures N_A in Round 1 and never moves, D does not become a blocking parent anywhere. The resulting match M(D) = N_A (Rank 2) is achieved immediately, without relying on the Part 2 iteration process.

1. Check for highest preferences (N_C, N_B, N_A):

1. True Preference Submission (L_A = [N_A, N_C, N_D, N_B, N_E]): The initial DA run results in Parent_A matching with N_A (Rank 1).

2. Strategic Submission (L'_A = [N_C, N_A, N_D, N_B, N_E]): By ranking N_C first, Parent_A delays proposing to N_A. In the initial DA run, A is rejected by N_C.

   Using the true preferences, the DAA process yields the stable matching M = {(P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_B), (P_E, N_D)}.
   Parent_D is matched with N_B, which is their 3rd preferred choice (N_C, N_A, N_B, N_E, N_D).

2. Determine if a better outcome (N_C or N_A) is possible:
   N_C prefers P_C (1st) over P_D (3rd). Since P_C is rejected by their top 3 choices (N_D, N_A, N_B) due to higher priority parents, P_C applies to N_C and obtains the seat, blocking P_D.

Parent_A's true preference list is [Nursery_A (R1), Nursery_C (R2), Nursery_D (R3), Nursery_B (R4), Nursery_E (R5)].

1. Analyze Truthful Submission: Submitting [A, C, D, B, E] led to a Part 1 match M(0)(P_A)=A (Rank 1). However, Parent_D (P_D) was identified as a blocking parent at C. The subsequent reruns, triggered by P_D and P_A waiving their blocking schools, stabilized at a final match M*(P_A) = E (Rank 5).

2. Strategic Deviation: The goal is to find an initial submission L_A that avoids the severe penalty of being displaced by P_D (who is higher priority at A) during the reruns. This requires altering the initial DA sequence to prevent the formation of the blocking parent P_D at C.

3. Testing L_A = [D, A, C, B, E]: By submitting D first (Rank 3), P_A is immediately rejected by P_C at D (P_C is higher priority). P_A is then free to apply to A in Step 2.

1. Initial Truthful DA (Part 1): If all parents submit their true preferences, Parent_A achieves a match with Nursery_B (Rank 4).
2.

The iterative restriction process penalizes these blocking parents by removing the temporary nursery from their preference lists.
3. Convergence: Analyzing the iterative process shows that submitting the truthful list leads to a sequence of restrictions on P_D, P_B, and eventually P_A itself (removing A and B from P_A's list). This convergence forces the final stable matching (M_final) to assign Parent_A to Nursery_E (Rank 5).

1. Analyze the outcome of submitting True Preferences (Standard DAA, Part 1):
If Parent_D (P_D) submits the true list, P_D proposes N_C in Round 1. P_E also proposes N_C. N_C temporarily admits P_D (P_D is 3rd priority, P_E is 4th). P_E is rejected. Later, P_C (1st priority at N_C) proposes N_C (Round 5) and rejects P_D. P_D eventually settles for N_D (5th choice).

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check):
P_D was temporarily admitted to N_C (D->C) and caused P_E to be rejected, but P_D's final admission was N_D (D->D). P_D is identified as a blocking parent at N_C. The rule dictates that N_C must be removed from P_D's list, and the DAA reruns with P_D's new list: ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'].

3. Anticipate the Rerun Outcome:
When the DAA reruns with P_D skipping N_C, P_D proposes N_A (Rank 1). P_D is 2nd priority at N_A, only behind P_B. P_B proposes N_B (Rank 1). Thus, in Round 1, P_D competes only with P_A (3rd priority) for N_A and wins. P_D secures N_A (2nd choice) in the final stable matching (M2/M3).

1. Initial DA Run (Truthful reporting): Parent_A secures $N_A$ (1st choice). However, Parent_D is identified as a blocking parent at $N_C$, forcing $P_D$ to waive $N_C$.
2. Rerun 1: $P_D$ prioritizes $N_A$ and rejects $P_A$. $P_A$ is rejected multiple times and temporarily accepted at $N_B$, but is ultimately rejected by $P_D$ and lands at $N_E$. $P_A$ is identified as a blocking parent at $N_B$.

Analysis shows that Parent_A is significantly disadvantaged by the high priority of Parent_D (2nd at $N_A$, 1st at $N_B$) and the mechanism's enforcement of waivers, which routes $P_D$ towards $N_A$ and $N_B$.

   The unique stable matching (M_S) assigns Parent_D to N_B, which is Rank 3 on the TPL.

2. Impact of Misrepresentation: Since N_C and N_A are claimed by higher priority parents (P_C and P_B), Parent_D cannot achieve Rank 1 or 2. The best achievable rank is Rank 3 (N_B).

3. Impact of Blocking Parent Rule: If Parent_D submits sincerely ([C, A, B, E, D]), they are temporarily admitted at C (R1, S1) and A (R1, S6), causing rejections, but ultimately move to B.

2.  **Analyze the Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Parents):** Part 2 penalizes a Parent P if they are temporarily admitted at a Nursery N, reject another Parent P', but ultimately leave N for a different final match M(P). Since Parent_A's final stable match M(A)=E, any temporary admission at a preferred school (A, C, D, or B) that results in a rejection will cause that school to be removed from Parent_A's list in subsequent reruns.

3.  **Strategic Outcome:** If Parent_A submits their true list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'], the DA process leads to M(A)=E.

3. Nursery B (Rank 3): Parent D (P_D) has the highest priority at N_B (P_D > P_A, P_B, P_C, P_E). P_D can secure this spot against all other applicants.

1. Analysis of True Preferences (P_D: [N_C, N_A, N_B, N_E, N_D]):
   - N_C (Rank 1): P_D is rejected by P_C (who has higher priority at N_C, P_C > P_D).
   - N_A (Rank 2): P_D is rejected by P_B (who has higher priority at N_A, P_B > P_D).

2. Standard DA Outcome (Part 1, using True Preferences): The simulation showed that the resulting match is M = {(P_B, N_A), (P_D, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_E, N_D), (P_A, N_E)}. P_D matches N_B.

3. Part 2 Check: Since P_D temporarily held N_C (R1) and N_A (R6) before settling at N_B, P_D was identified as a blocking parent at both N_C and N_A. The system iteratively removed these options from P_D's list and reran DA. However, in all reruns, P_D's final stable match remained N_B (Rank 3).

4.

1. Initial DA Run (Truthful Preferences P_T = [A, C, D, B, E]): I simulated the DA algorithm using the true preferences of all parents. The resulting allocation (M1) was A->E, B->A, C->C, D->B, E->D. Parent_A achieved their 5th choice (E).

While the Part 2 adjustment complicates the environment, the mechanism fundamentally relies on rerunning DA on restricted lists.

1. Initial DA (Truthful Submission): Submitting [C, A, B, E, D] leads to an initial match M1 where Parent_D matches B (Rank 3).
2. Blocking Parent Check 1: In M1, Parent_D is identified as a blocking parent at Nursery_C (Round 1, P_D temporarily admitted, rejected P_E, but P_D ultimately matched B). This forces Parent_D to waive C.

However, this matching results in Parent_D being a 'blocking parent' at Nursery_C (P_D was temporarily admitted to C but finally matched to E, causing rejections). 

2. Rerun Consequence: The waiver forces P_D to remove C from their list. Since P_D has higher priority than P_A at Nursery_A, P_D proposes A first in the rerun and displaces P_A. This leads to a final allocation (M2) where Parent_A is matched to Nursery_E [Rank 5].

3. Strategic Evaluation: I tested several strategic reorderings of Parent_A's top four choices (e.g., proposing C first, or B first).

Conclusion: Since Parent_A cannot strategically prevent the blocking parent mechanism from triggering the detrimental rerun, and all tested submitted lists result in the worst outcome (Rank 5), submitting the truthful preference list remains the optimal strategy, as it maximizes the initial outcome (Rank 1) even if that outcome is later unstable under the Part 2 rules.",True,Nursery_E,False,False,5

I first assume Parent_B submits their TP: ['Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C'], and all others submit their TPs.

Running Part 1 (Standard DA): The initial outcome is M(P_B) = Nursery_D (2nd choice).

Running Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): Parents P_D and P_E are identified as blocking parents because their temporary admissions caused rejections but they ultimately matched elsewhere. Specifically, P_E is the last blocking parent identified (at N_D), leading to P_E removing N_D from their list.

Part 1 Rerun 1 (with P_E's list modified): The DA process is rerun. This results in a new stable matching where M'(P_B) = Nursery_B (1st choice).

Part 2 Check Rerun 1: No further blocking parents are found, and the process ends.

In standard DA where applicants propose, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy, guaranteeing the best stable outcome for the proposer. While the Part 2 correction adds complexity, it essentially enforces the necessary waivers required to reach the P-OSM based on the submitted preferences.

1. **Analysis using True Preferences (TPL):** If Parent_D submits the TPL ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the initial DA run (Part 1) results in a match M = (D, N_B) (Rank 3).
2. **Blocking Check (Part 2):** In M, Parent_D temporarily secured N_C (R1) and N_A (R8) before settling for N_B (R14). P_D was identified as a blocking parent at N_C and N_A because P_D caused other parents to be rejected from those schools but ultimately left for N_B. The correction mechanism forces P_D (and P_A) to waive schools.
3. **Resulting Stable Matching:** The repeated process of waivers eventually forces Parent_D to waive N_C. The process stabilizes with Parent_D matching with N_A (Rank 2). This N_A match is the best stable outcome achievable for Parent_D in this market.

1. Initial Analysis (True Preferences $P^0$): Submitting the true list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E'] leads to $M_1 = (A, A)$. This is Parent_A's 1st choice. However, this matching triggers the waiver process (Parent D blocks at C).
2. Waiver Cascade: The system iteratively adjusts preferences ($P^0 	o P^1 	o P^2$). The final stable matching ($M^* = M3$), assuming all other parents submit their true preferences initially, results in Parent_A being matched to Nursery_E (5th choice), primarily because high-priority parents (D and B) gain priority at A's preferred schools (A and B) during the adjustment phase.

1. Initial DA (Truthful Submission): If Parent_E submits their true list ['Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E'] along with all other true lists, the initial stable match (M_DA) results in Parent_E matching with Nursery_D (Rank 4).
2. Part 2 Reruns: The blocking parent check forces Parent_D to waive Nursery_C (Rerun 1). The subsequent DA results in Parent_E matching with Nursery_C (Rank 1). The check forces Parent_D to waive Nursery_A (Rerun 2). The final DA results in Parent_E matching with Nursery_C (Rank 1).

However, the mechanism includes a complex Part 2 procedure involving the removal of 'blocking parents,' which destabilizes strategy-proofness and allows for beneficial misrepresentation.

1. Baseline (Truthful Submission): Submitting the true list [A, C, D, B, E] results in a sequence of forced waivers (P_B waives A, P_A waives B, P_D waives C), leading to a final stable matching M3 where Parent_A is matched to Nursery_E (5th choice).
2. Strategic Goal: The best outcome achieved temporarily during the truthful process was M1, where Parent_A matched Nursery_D (3rd choice). This outcome was lost because Parent_A became a blocking parent at Nursery_B, forcing a waiver that degraded the final result.
3. Strategic Deviation: Parent_A must submit a list S_A that maintains the favorable waivers of others while preventing Parent_A from becoming a blocking parent that forces a detrimental self-waiver.
4. Implementation: By swapping the ranking of Nursery_B and Nursery_D, submitting S_A = [A, C, B, D, E], Parent_A maintains their 1st and 2nd choices but prefers B over D. This change ensures that when Parent_A is matched to B in Rerun 1 (M1'), Parent_A is no longer a blocking parent at B (since M1'(A)=B, which is preferred/accepted). 
5. Resulting Cascade: This successful deviation maintains the favorable waiver of P_B and triggers a new cascade of necessary waivers for P_D and P_E (who have higher priority at Nursery_A).

In standard DA with unit quotas (which is the case here, as all nurseries have 1 seat), submitting one's true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (parents), guaranteeing the highest possible stable match relative to everyone else's submitted lists. 

The crucial instruction regarding Part 2 states: 'This automatic waiver [blocking parent removal] will never change your final admission but may improve other Parents' final admissions.' This guarantee implies that the final outcome secured by Parent_B is invariant to the reruns caused by blocking parents, and thus, Parent_B only needs to maximize their assignment in the initial DA run (Part 1).

In standard DAA, reporting true preferences is a dominant strategy for parents to secure their best possible stable match (the Parent-Optimal Stable Matching, P-OSM).

1. Initial DAA Run (Part 1) with all true preferences: Parent_C was initially matched with Nursery_C (4th choice).
2. Blocking Elimination (Part 2): This process identified Parent_A and Parent_D as blocking parents in the initial run, leading to automatic waivers (N_B removed from P_A's list, N_C removed from P_D's list).

In this final outcome, Parent_C is matched with Nursery_D, which is Parent_C's 1st choice.

1. Analysis of the Stable Matching (SM):
If all parents submit their true preferences, the outcome of the Deferred Acceptance (DA) process, even after resolving 'blocking parents' (Part 2), converges to the unique Parent-optimal stable matching, M_DA = {(P_A, N_E), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_B), (P_E, N_D)}. In this stable matching, Parent D is matched with N_B (Rank 3).

2. Strategic Possibilities for Parent D:
Parent D cannot achieve N_C (Rank 1) because N_C prefers P_C (1st priority) over P_D (3rd priority), and P_C eventually secures N_C. Parent D cannot achieve N_A (Rank 2) because N_A prefers P_B (1st priority) over P_D (2nd priority), and P_B eventually secures N_A.
Therefore, N_B (Rank 3) is the highest stable match achievable for Parent D.

3. Optimizing the Submission:
If Parent D submits their true preferences [C, A, B, E, D], the DA procedure involves temporary matches at N_C (R1) and N_A (R8), leading to Parent D being identified as a 'blocking parent' twice, requiring two reruns (Part 2) before settling at N_B. This is inefficient and risks unforeseen instability.

4. Strategic Decision:
Parent D has the highest priority (1st) at N_B. By submitting N_B first, Parent D secures their best stable match immediately in Round 1, preventing rejection by higher priority parents and avoiding the activation of the complex 'blocking parent' mechanism, which ensures the desired stable outcome is reached quickly and reliably.

The matching process involves the Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1) followed by an iterative adjustment based on 'blocking parents' (Part 2).

1. Standard DA (Part 1): When all agents submit their true preferences, the initial stable matching (M1) resulted in Parent_E matching with Nursery_D (Rank 4).
2. Blocking Parent Analysis (Part 2): The mechanism identifies agents who temporarily blocked others but ultimately did not utilize that position. This forces the blocking agent to waive the blocked nursery and triggers a rerun of DA.
   - In the initial run (M1), Parents A and D were identified as blocking parents (P_A blocked N_B; P_D blocked N_C and N_A).
   - Rerun 1 (M2): After P_A waived N_B, P_E still matched N_D. P_D remained a blocking parent at N_C.
   - Rerun 2 (M3): After P_D waived N_C, the DA algorithm yielded a stable matching where Parent_E matched with Nursery_C.

Since Nursery_C is the Rank 1 choice for Parent_E, this is the best possible outcome. This outcome was achieved when Parent_E submitted their true preferences.
