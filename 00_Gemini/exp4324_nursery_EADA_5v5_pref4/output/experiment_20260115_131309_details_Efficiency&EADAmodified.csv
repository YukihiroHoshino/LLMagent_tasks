Since all nursery quotas are 1, the standard DA algorithm is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (parents). This means that submitting the true preference list guarantees the highest possible stable match for Parent_A, provided the Part 2 rule does not fundamentally change the strategic landscape for Parent_A.

First, I calculated the stable matching using everyone's true preferences (Part 1):
1. R1: D admits D; E admits B. Rejects: A, C, E.
2. R2: A admits A; C admits C; E admits E (rejects B).
3. R3: A holds A (rejects B).
4. R4: B admits B.
Final Stable Match: (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).
Parent_A receives Nursery_A (2nd choice).

Second, I checked for 'blocking parents' (Part 2). A blocking parent P must satisfy two conditions: 1) P caused rejections during temporary admission T, and 2) T(P) differs from F(P). Since the resulting matching is stable, no parent was temporarily admitted and later rejected, meaning T(P) = F(P) for all parents who caused rejections (D at D, E at E, A at A). Therefore, Part 2 does not execute any waivers, and the final match remains (A, A).

Executing DAA with true preferences:
1. Parent B proposes to Nursery E (1st choice).
2. Nursery E receives only B's application and accepts B.
3. Since B is matched to their 1st choice, they cannot move to a preferred option later. The resulting assignment (B -> E) is stable and optimal for Parent B.

1. Analyze Nursery_D (Rank 1): Parent_C is 4th priority at N_D (after P_B, P_D, P_E). Since P_D is 2nd priority and applies to D first, P_C will certainly be rejected in Round 1 if P_C applies to D. Therefore, D is unattainable.

2. Analyze Nursery_C (Rank 2): Parent_C is 5th (lowest) priority at N_C. However, the higher priority parents for C (P_D, P_E) both rank D or E higher and are expected to secure those spots early in the process.
   - If P_C applies to C in Round 1 (strategic move), P_D and P_E apply to D. P_C secures C immediately because there is no R1 competition for C.

1. **Maximize Rank 1**: Parent_D's highest preference is Nursery_D. We must check if Parent_D can secure $N_D$ by submitting the true list: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E'].

1. Analyze the outcome if Parent_E submits their True Preference List (T = ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A']).

2. Check Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   A parent P is a blocking parent at N if P was temporarily admitted at N, causing rejections, AND P eventually moved away from N. Reviewing the history of Part 1:
   - P_D caused rejections at N_D but did not move away (final match N_D).
   - P_B was temporarily admitted at N_E in R1, but this admission caused no immediate rejections. P_B later moved away (rejected by P_E in R2, finally matched N_B), but since P_B did not cause rejections upon temporary admission, P_B is not a blocking parent at N_E.
   Since no blocking parents are found, the outcome M is the final admission.

1. Initial DA Run (Truthful Reporting): If Parent_A submits their true preference list ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C'], the resulting stable matching ($M^*$) is calculated.
    - Parent_A applies to $N_D$ (R1) but is rejected because $P_D$ is preferred by $N_D$ and also applies. 
    - Parent_A applies to $N_A$ (R2) and is accepted. 
    - The final stable outcome for Parent_A is $N_A$ (2nd choice).

2. Analysis of $N_D$ (Top Choice): $N_D$ strictly prefers $P_B, P_D, P_E, P_C$ over $P_A$. Since $P_D, P_C, P_E$ all apply to $N_D$ in R1, and $P_D$ has the highest priority among them and $N_D$ is $P_D$'s first choice, $P_D$ secures $N_D$. Parent_A cannot achieve $N_D$.

3. Impact of Blocking Parent Rule: The blocking parent rule (Part 2) penalizes parents who temporarily hold a spot, cause rejections, and then move elsewhere, by removing the temporarily held school from their list and rerunning DA. This rule primarily aims to correct certain types of instability but does not generally create beneficial manipulation opportunities for the proposing agents (parents). Attempts to strategically misreport to induce a blocking scenario (as shown in external analysis) generally resulted in Parent_A achieving a worse outcome ($N_B$ or $N_E$).

I executed the DA algorithm using Parent_B's True Preference List: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'].
1. Round 1: P_B proposes to N_E and is temporarily admitted. P_E proposes to N_D and is rejected.

1. Analyze P_C's preferred match (N_D): P_C ranks N_D first. However, N_D prioritizes P_B (1st), P_D (2nd), P_E (3rd), and P_C (4th). Since P_D also ranks N_D first, P_D will always apply in Round 1 and secure the temporary spot, as P_D has higher priority than P_C.
2. Determine P_C's best stable outcome: Since P_C cannot obtain N_D, P_C's next best choice is N_C. If P_C submits truthfully, P_C is rejected from N_D in R1 and proposes to N_C in R2. Since P_C is the only parent whose second choice is N_C, P_C secures N_C in R2 (P_C is 5th priority at N_C, but no one else applies).
3. Impact of Part 2: The standard stable match (P_C matched with N_C) is achieved in Part 1. Since all parents who received a temporary admission either kept it or moved to a strictly preferred position, no 'blocking parents' are created. Thus, Part 2 does not alter the stable outcome derived from Part 1.

2. Nursery_C is the next best target. Parent_C has the lowest priority at N_C. If Parent_C submits their TPL, they apply to N_C in Round 2, but are later bumped by Parent_E (who has higher priority at N_C) in Round 3.
3. To secure N_C, Parent_C must apply to N_C immediately (Round 1) and ensure that higher priority competitors (especially Parent_E) are matched elsewhere before they apply to N_C.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission): Parent_E's true preference list is ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A'].
    * Round 1: P_E applies to D. D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E. P_D has the 2nd highest priority at D (P_E is 3rd) and wins the seat, rejecting P_E. 
    * Round 2: P_E applies to E (Rank 2). E currently holds P_B. P_E has higher priority (3rd) than P_B (4th) at E. P_E is admitted (T), rejecting P_B. 
    * The process concludes with P_E matched to Nursery E (Rank 2).

2. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2): In the resulting stable match, P_E is matched to the nursery where they caused a rejection (E). Since P_E remains matched to E, the 'Discrepancy' condition (moving elsewhere) is not met. Therefore, P_E is not a blocking parent, and the outcome is final.

3. Strategic Consideration: To achieve Rank 1 (Nursery D), P_E would need to prevent P_D from securing D in Round 1. P_D applies to D in R1 and has higher priority than P_E.

1. Analysis of True Preferences: Parent_E's true preference list is ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A'].
2. Constraint at N_D: Parent_E is Priority 3 at N_D. Parent_D (Priority 2) and Parent_B (Priority 1) are higher priority. Since Parent_D prefers N_D (Rank 1) and has higher priority than Parent_E, Parent_D will secure N_D in Round 1 of DA, regardless of Parent_E's actions.

1.

3. Check Part 2 implications: I verified that the stable matching M achieved using true preferences does not involve any 'blocking parents' (a parent who temporarily caused a rejection but ended up elsewhere). Therefore, the matching M is the final outcome, and Parent_A receives Nursery_A.

Parent_C (P_C) is ranked 4th at N_D, behind P_B, P_D, and P_E. P_D and P_E both list N_D as their first choice. In Round 1, P_D will be admitted to N_D due to superior priority (P_D > P_E > P_C). Therefore, P_C cannot obtain N_D regardless of strategic submission, as P_D and P_E are submitting truthfully and P_D has higher priority.

2. Simulate Truthful Submission (Choice List: [D, C, E, A, B]):
*   R1: P_D gets N_D. P_C is rejected.
*   R2: P_C applies to N_C (Rank 2). N_C receives P_C and accepts (P_C is the only applicant to N_C in R2). The resulting stable matching is M = {(P_D, N_D), (P_C, N_C), (P_A, N_A), (P_E, N_E), (P_B, N_B)}.

1. Analyze R1 (Nursery_D): Parent_C is 4th priority at N_D (behind P_B, P_D, P_E). P_D and P_E both list N_D first. Since P_B applies to N_E, P_D (2nd priority at N_D) will secure N_D in Round 1. Therefore, N_D is unattainable for Parent_C.

2. Analyze R2 (Nursery_C): Parent_C is 5th (last) priority at N_C. N_C is only attainable if all four higher priority parents (P_D, P_E, P_A, P_B) are matched elsewhere before they apply to N_C.

1. Analyze Part 1 (DA): The DA algorithm is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents). This means that submitting the true preference list (TPL) guarantees the Parent the best possible outcome among all stable matchings, regardless of what other parents submit.

2. Determine the outcome of truthful submission:

1. Calculate the outcome using the true preferences (DA run):

   - Nursery D receives proposals from A, C, D, E. Since Parent D has the highest priority among applicants at D, D accepts D. A is rejected.

   - The final stable matching (M_DA) is unique: {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Parent A matches with Nursery A.

2. Analyze strategic manipulation:
   Since the stable matching (M_S) is unique in this market, the Parent-Optimal outcome (M_P) is M_S.

I simulated the matching process (Part 1) using Parent_B's true preferences and found that Parent_B is matched with Nursery_B (their 3rd choice). This outcome is the best stable match available to Parent_B, as they were rejected by their higher choices (E and A) in favor of parents (E and A, respectively) whom those nurseries prioritized higher than Parent_B.

1. Analyze Maximum Attainable Rank (Nursery_D, Rank 1): Parent_C prefers Nursery_D first. However, Parents D and E also prefer Nursery_D first, and Parent_D (2nd priority at N_D) and Parent_E (3rd priority at N_D) both have higher priority than Parent_C (4th priority at N_D). Since P_D and P_E apply immediately, and P_D secures the spot in Round 1 (as P_B, 1st priority, applies elsewhere), N_D is unattainable for Parent_C.

2. Analyze Second Preference (Nursery_C, Rank 2): Parent_C must aim for Nursery_C. In the truthful simulation (where P_C submits [D, C, E, A, B]): P_C is rejected from N_D in R1. P_C applies to N_C in R2. All parents who have higher priority than P_C at N_C (P_D, P_E, P_A) are matched to schools they prefer over N_C by R2. Thus, N_C is available for P_C in R2, resulting in a match.

3. Impact of Strategic Submission: Since DAA is parent-proposing, truthful submission is generally a dominant strategy for parents. Strategic manipulation usually aims to divert higher-priority competitors. However, since P_D and P_E are applying truthfully to N_D first, P_C cannot affect their choice. If P_C tries to list N_C first to secure it immediately, the final outcome remains N_C. The existence of Part 2 does not override the fundamental result of DAA concerning the proposing side's optimal strategy, especially since the rules imply Part 2 cannot change the final admission of the parent whose list is being determined.

1. Analysis for Nursery E (Rank 1): Parent_B is 4th priority at E. Parent_E (3rd priority) prefers E as their 2nd choice and will be rejected from their 1st choice (D) by Parent_D (2nd priority at D).

1. **Analyze Truthful Submission:** If Parent_B submits the true list ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'], the outcome of Part 1 is P_B -> N_B (Rank 3).

Parent C's first choice is N_D. In Round 1, N_D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, and P_E. N_D's priority list ranks P_D (2nd) above P_C (4th). Therefore, P_D is accepted by N_D, and P_C is rejected.
Parent C's second choice is N_C. In Round 2, P_C applies to N_C. N_C receives only P_C and accepts the application.

The resulting stable match is (P_C, N_C), which corresponds to P_C's 2nd highest preference.

2. Check for strategic manipulation:
Since P_C cannot overcome P_D's priority at N_D, N_D is unattainable for P_C, regardless of manipulation. Any manipulation (like moving N_C to the first spot) would only risk missing N_C without securing N_D.

I first calculated the outcome based on all parents submitting their true preferences (M1):
Round 1: P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E propose to N_D. P_B proposes to N_E.
N_D admits P_D (2nd priority), rejects P_E (3rd priority).
N_E admits P_B.
Round 2: P_E proposes to N_E. P_E (3rd priority at N_E) displaces P_B (4th priority).
Final Matching (M1): (P_E, N_E). This is Rank 2 on P_E's True Preference List.

To determine if N_D (Rank 1) is achievable, I checked stability. P_E prefers N_D over N_E. However, N_D prefers P_D (Rank 2) over P_E (Rank 3). Since P_D is matched to N_D in M1, and N_D prefers P_D, the pair (P_E, N_D) is not a blocking pair. P_E cannot break this stable match.

Since N_D is unreachable in any stable matching due to higher priority parents (P_D and P_B, although P_B applies elsewhere initially), N_E (Rank 2) is the optimal achievable outcome.

1. Analyze Rank 1 (Nursery_D): Parent_E prefers N_D (Rank 1). Competitors are P_A, P_C, P_D. N_D's priorities are P_B > P_D > P_E > P_C > P_A.

1. Initial Analysis (Truthful Submission):
I assume Parent_D submits their true preference list: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E'].

Round 1:
Parent_D applies to Nursery_D (Rank 1). N_D receives applications from A, C, D, E. N_D's priority list is B > D > E > C > A. Since P_D is the highest priority applicant (Rank 2 overall), P_D is temporarily admitted to N_D.

2. Subsequent Rounds:
In subsequent rounds, P_D remains matched with N_D. The only parent N_D prefers over P_D is P_B (Rank 1). P_B applies to N_E (Rank 1), then N_A (Rank 2), and finally N_B (Rank 3). P_B is matched with N_B before ever applying to N_D (Rank 4). Therefore, P_D secures N_D.

3. Furthermore, because Parent_D's temporary admission to N_D is also their final admission (M(P_D) = N_D), Parent_D is not a 'blocking Parent' at N_D, and the subsequent Part 2 procedure will not affect Parent_D's assignment.

Parent_C's True Preference List: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].

1. Check for Rank 1 (Nursery_D): Parent_C is 4th priority at N_D ([B, D, E, C, A]). In Round 1, N_D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E. P_D (2nd priority) wins the seat. Since N_D is P_D's 1st choice, P_D will hold N_D, making it unattainable for P_C.

2. Following the DA steps, Parent_A secures a match with Nursery_A in Round 2. The resulting stable matching is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Parent_A is matched to Nursery_A, which is their second choice (Rank 2).
3. Since this matching is stable, Parent_A cannot unilaterally deviate to achieve a better outcome (Rank 1, Nursery_D). 
4. Furthermore, based on the execution of DA, no parent meets the criteria of being a 'Blocking Parent' (a parent who temporarily blocks a seat they ultimately do not utilize and whose temporary admission caused rejections). Therefore, the outcome M is the final assignment.

2. We must check if Part 2 (Blocking Parent removal) could change the outcome. A Parent is blocking if their temporary admission caused a rejection AND they moved away.

1. Simulation using True Preferences (P_B submits [E, A, B, D, C]):

2. Obstacle for Rank 1 (Nursery D): Parent C's preferred Nursery D is highly competitive.

1. Calculate the POSM using true preferences: Parent_D (P_D) strongly prefers N_D (Rank 1). However, P_B (Rank 1 at N_D) ends up displacing P_D at N_D in Round 4, leading P_D to match with N_B (Rank 2).

Parent_A's highest preference, Nursery_D (Rank 1), is highly competitive. Parent_D also ranks N_D first and has the second-highest priority at N_D (P_B is first, P_D is second).

1. Round 1: P_B proposes E, is tentatively admitted. P_D is admitted by D (rejecting A, C, E).
2. Round 2: P_E proposes E. Since P_E has higher priority at E than P_B (P_E is 3rd, P_B is 4th), E admits P_E and rejects P_B. P_A proposes A, is admitted.

1. Analysis of N_D: Parent C's top choice is N_D. However, P_D also ranks N_D first and has higher priority at N_D (P_D is 2nd priority, P_C is 4th). P_D successfully secures N_D in Round 1 of DA. Thus, N_D is unattainable for P_C.

This matching is stable (P_C prefers no unmatched nursery or any nursery matched to someone they are preferred over).
3. Strategic Consideration: Since the P-optimal stable matching (P_C, N_C) is robust regardless of P_C's submission order (as demonstrated by testing alternative lists like [C, D, E, A, B] or [E, C, D, A, B]), P_C cannot achieve a better result than Rank 2 (N_C).

2. We analyzed the temporary admissions in this stable outcome (M*). We found that no parent was temporarily admitted to a nursery, caused rejections, and then moved to a different final match. Therefore, no 'blocking parents' are identified in Part 2.
3. Since Part 2 does not trigger any list waivers or reruns, the outcome (P_B, N_B) is the final, stable allocation. 
4. Any attempt to manipulate the list risks a worse outcome (e.g., matching with N_D or N_C) without securing N_E or N_A, as Parent B has low priority (4th or 5th) at those highly desired nurseries compared to rivals (P_E, P_D, P_A).

1. Analysis of True Preferences: If Parent_C submits their true preferences ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'], the simulation (Part 1) results in Parent_C matching with Nursery_C (Rank 2). Nursery_D (Rank 1) is unattainable because Parent_D is highly preferred by Nursery_D (2nd priority) and applies first, beating Parent_C (4th priority).

2. Check priority at N_D: N_D prioritizes Parent_B (1st), Parent_D (2nd), Parent_E (3rd), Parent_C (4th), Parent_A (5th). Since Parent_D proposes N_D and has higher priority (2nd) than Parent_C (4th), Parent_C will be rejected by N_D. Rank 1 is unattainable.
3. Secure the next best option: Parent_C's Rank 2 choice is Nursery_C. If Parent_C proposes truthfully, they are rejected from N_D in R1 and propose to N_C in R2. N_C receives only Parent_C's proposal and admits them. This secures Rank 2 (N_C).

1. Parent_E's top choice is Nursery_D. However, in Round 1, Nursery_D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, and P_E.

2. P_E is rejected from N_D and applies to their second choice, Nursery_E, in Round 2. P_E secures N_E over P_B (who was temporarily admitted in R1) because P_E has higher priority at N_E (3rd vs 4th).

First, I determine the stable outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (Parent_A's true list: D > A > B > E > C):
1. In Round 1, Nursery D receives proposals from A, C, D, E. Since Parent D (Rank 2 at D) is prioritized over Parent A (Rank 5 at D), D is assigned to D. Parent A is rejected.
2. Parent A applies to Nursery A (2nd choice) in Round 2 and is admitted, as higher priority parents (E, C, D) are matched elsewhere and prefer their current assignments.
3. The resulting stable matching (μ1) is: A->A, B->B, C->C, D->D, E->E. Parent_A secures Nursery A (2nd choice).

Next, I evaluate Part 2. A parent is 'blocking' if they were temporarily admitted, caused rejection, AND ultimately moved away.

1. Initial DA Calculation (using true preferences):
I determined the stable outcome by running the DA algorithm using the true preferences of all parents. Parent_E (P_E) proposes to N_D (Rank 1), but is rejected in favor of P_D (who has higher priority at N_D and also proposes N_D first).

Since P_D has higher priority than P_E at N_D (Rank 2 vs Rank 3 for P_E) and P_D also ranks N_D first, N_D is unattainable for P_E. Thus, N_E (Rank 2) is the best possible outcome.

I checked if the resulting stable matching creates any 'blocking parents' according to the definition in Part 2.

1. Analyze the highest preference (Nursery_D): Parent_C has low priority (4th/5) at Nursery_D, behind Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_B. In Round 1 (assuming truthful submission), Parent_D secures Nursery_D, making it unattainable for Parent_C.
2. Analyze the second preference (Nursery_C): In the truthful simulation, Parent_C applies to C in Round 2 and is admitted, as C receives no other applications at that stage. This results in Parent_C matching with their 2nd choice.
3. Analyze alternatives: Parent_C has the lowest priority (5th/5) at Nursery_E and low priority at Nursery_A and Nursery_B. Attempting to match with E or A early is unlikely to succeed and might prevent Parent_C from securing C.

Since the mechanism guarantees the Parent-Optimal Stable Matching (POSM) and P-DA is strategy-proof, submitting the true preference list maximizes Parent_C's outcome, which is confirmed to be Nursery_C (2nd choice) in the simulation.",True,Nursery_C,True,True,2

The mechanism is a Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance Algorithm (DAA) followed by a check for 'blocking parents' (Part 2).

1. Simulate the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences (P_T):
   - Round 1 proposals result in P_D being temporarily admitted to N_D (P_D's Rank 1) due to high priority (2nd highest overall, highest among applicants).
   - The DAA simulation converges quickly, resulting in the final allocation: (P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E).
   - Parent_D achieves a Rank 1 match (N_D).

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2):
   - Since P_D achieved their top choice (N_D), they have no incentive to move away, and thus P_D cannot be a blocking parent at N_D.
   - Reviewing all temporary admissions, no parent who caused a rejection (P_D at D, P_E at E) ultimately moved away from that nursery. Therefore, the truthful outcome triggers no Part 2 revisions.

The DA algorithm is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents). This means that submitting their true preferences guarantees Parent_E the best possible stable match according to their preference list, regardless of the strategies employed by other parents.

First, I determine the stable match (M) using the true preferences:
1. Round 1: All parents apply to their rank 1 choice. Parent_E applies to N_D. N_D prefers P_D (2nd priority) over P_E (3rd priority). P_E is rejected by N_D.
2. Round 2: P_E applies to N_E (rank 2). N_E prefers P_E (3rd priority) over P_B (4th priority), who was holding the seat. P_E is tentatively admitted to N_E.
3. The final stable match is M = {(D, P_D), (E, P_E), (C, P_C), (B, P_B), (A, P_A)}. Parent_E is matched with N_E (Rank 2).

Second, I consider Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check). A parent is 'blocking' only if their temporary admission caused a rejection AND their final admission differs from that temporary admission. Since the resulting matching M is stable, no parent who was temporarily admitted at any step ends up moving away from a nursery where they caused a rejection. Thus, no blocking parents are found, and the allocation is final.

The DA algorithm guarantees a Parent-optimal stable matching based on the submitted preferences. If a matching is Parent-optimal stable, no parent can unilaterally misrepresent their preferences to achieve a strictly better outcome in terms of their true preferences. 

1. Baseline Calculation (Submitting True Preferences): If Parent_B submits their true list ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'], the resulting stable matching M assigns Parent_B to Nursery_B (Rank 3).
    * Parent_B's 1st choice (N_E) is secured by Parent_E, who ranks higher (P_E > P_B at N_E).
    * Parent_B's 2nd choice (N_A) is secured by Parent_A, who ranks higher (P_A > P_B at N_A).

2. Strategic Analysis: Since Parent_A and Parent_E are higher priority at P_B's top two choices and will apply there after being rejected from their mutual top choice (N_D), Parent_B cannot secure N_E or N_A, even by ranking them first. Any manipulation (like ranking N_A first) results in Parent_B being rejected and eventually matched with N_B.

3. Part 2 Consideration: The mechanism includes a check for 'blocking Parents.' A Parent_B only becomes a blocking parent if they caused a rejection while temporarily admitted and then moved elsewhere. In the stable outcome derived from true preferences, Parent_B was rejected from N_E by a higher priority parent (P_E) and did not cause any rejections while holding N_E temporarily. Thus, Parent_B is not a blocking parent, and Part 2 does not alter the outcome derived from Part 1.

2. The procedure continues, resulting in a final stable match where Parent_D is matched with Nursery_D.

2. Stability and Strategic Misreporting:
   - Since Parent D has higher priority at N_D and prefers N_D (Rank 1), the pair (D, N_D) is robust and prevents E from accessing N_D in any stable matching. Therefore, N_D is genuinely unavailable to Parent E.

1. Simulate DA using the True Preference Lists of all Parents:

3. Check Part 2 (Blocking Parents):

2. Blocking Constraint Check: P_E's Rank 1 choice, N_D, is secured by P_D. N_D prefers P_D (2nd priority) over P_E (3rd priority). This forms a stable block (P_D, N_D) that P_E cannot break unilaterally.
3. Part 2 Impact: Part 2 attempts to fix matches where a parent temporarily held a seat but moved elsewhere. If I attempt manipulation (e.g., Simulation 4, submitting N_A first) to shift the outcome, it results in P_E being a 'blocking parent' at N_A. The mechanism then removes N_A from P_E's list and reruns Part 1. This rerun process leads back to the standard stable match outcome, where P_E receives N_E.

Since the stable match outcome achieved by submitting true preferences (N_E, Rank 2) is the best possible outcome given the constraints imposed by higher priority parents at P_E's preferred school (N_D), and because the mechanism structure does not reward manipulation, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,2

1. Simulate P-DA using Parent_A's True Preferences: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C'].
    - In Round 1, Parent_A applies to D but is rejected because Parent_D has higher priority at N_D (P_D is 2nd priority, P_A is 5th).
    - Parent_A is eventually matched with Nursery_A (True Rank 2).
    - The resulting stable matching is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2):

1. Analyze the competition for the top choice (Nursery_D):
Parent_E's Rank 1 is N_D. At N_D, Parent_E is 3rd in priority (P_B > P_D > P_E). Parent_D (Rank 2 priority) and Parent_A, Parent_C, and Parent_E all prefer N_D first.

1. Standard DA Simulation (using true preferences):

2. Blocking Parent Check:

2. Analysis of remaining options: When all parents submit true preferences, the stable outcome assigns Parent_C to Nursery_C (Rank 2).

   - Round 2: P_E proposes to N_E. Since N_E prioritizes P_E (3rd) over P_B (4th), P_E is admitted, and P_B is rejected. P_A is admitted to N_A. P_C is admitted to N_C.
   - Round 3: P_B proposes to N_B and is admitted.
   - Final Match: P_B is matched with N_B (3rd choice).

2. Stability Check (Part 2):
   The outcome is a stable match. We check for 'blocking parents'. A blocking parent must cause a rejection via temporary admission AND move to a different final match. In this simulation, P_D caused rejections but stayed at N_D. P_B was rejected from N_E; P_E stayed at N_E. Since the outcome is stable, the condition for a blocking parent is not met, and the procedure ends after Part 1.

Since the mechanism is strategy-proof for Parent B, submitting the true preference list guarantees the best possible stable match: N_B.",True,Nursery_B,True,True,3

In standard DA where capacities are 1, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents), guaranteeing the best possible stable match. I must verify if Part 2 fundamentally changes this.

1. Identify Parent C's highest possible match (Nursery_D, Rank 1). Parent C applies to N_D first. However, N_D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E (all rank N_D first). N_D prioritizes P_B (Rank 1), P_D (Rank 2), P_E (Rank 3), P_C (Rank 4), P_A (Rank 5). Since P_D (Rank 2) has higher priority than P_C (Rank 4), P_D secures N_D. P_C cannot obtain N_D.

2. Parent C's next choice is N_C (Rank 2). By submitting the true list (D, C, E, A, B), P_C is rejected by N_D in R1 and applies to N_C in R2. N_C admits P_C in R2. 

3. The resulting stable match M = {(P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E)} provides P_C with N_C (Rank 2). 

4. Analyzing Part 2: In the stable match M, there are no parents whose temporary admission caused a rejection AND whose final admission differed (no blocking parents). Thus, the match M is final.

5. Since strategic misrepresentation (e.g., trying to delay applying to C or applying to a worse school first) carries the risk of C filling up before P_C applies, and since the mechanism is designed to be strategy-proof for the proposing side regarding their best stable match, submitting the true preference list maximizes Parent C's outcome (N_C, Rank 2).",True,Nursery_C,True,True,2

1. **PPDA Simulation (Truthful Preferences):** When all parents submit their true preferences, Parent D is temporarily admitted to Nursery D in Round 1 (highest priority among applicants A, C, D, E at D). This admission holds throughout Part 1.

1. Standard DA Outcome (Part 1, all submit TPL):

   In Round 1, A applies to D. Since Parent_A is the lowest priority applicant at D (5th out of 5), A is rejected immediately. A is eventually matched with Nursery A (Rank 2), which is the stable match $M_0(A).

2. Blocking Parent Analysis (Part 2):
   The mechanism includes a check for 'blocking parents' who temporarily held a seat and caused rejections, but ultimately moved elsewhere. If Parent_A were to be a blocking parent at their top choice (D), D would be removed from A's list, potentially worsening A's outcome.

Check for Blocking Parents: In the truthful outcome M_F = { (P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E) }, no parent who caused a rejection (P_D at N_D, P_E at N_E) subsequently moved to a different assignment. Thus, no blocking parents are found, Part 2 does not modify preferences, and the matching is stable.

1. Analyze the feasibility of the top choice, Nursery_D: Parent_A has the lowest priority (5th) at Nursery_D. Since four other parents (P_B, P_D, P_E, P_C) are preferred over P_A, and three of them (P_C, P_D, P_E) list D as their first choice, P_A will be rejected from D in Round 1 if submitting truthfully. Specifically, P_D is admitted to D and remains matched there in the stable outcome, making D unobtainable for P_A.

2. Analyze the feasibility of the second choice, Nursery_A: Parent_A is 4th priority at Nursery_A. In the truthful DA run, P_A is matched to A in Round 2.

Since P_A cannot secure their 1st choice (Nursery_D) due to priority constraints, Nursery_A is the highest ranked stable match available.

Second, I analyze the effect of Part 2 (Blocking Parent rule). If Parent_A submits true preferences and achieves their best stable match $N^*$ (Nursery_A), Parent_A would only leave a temporarily held school $N'$ if $N^*$ is strictly preferred to $N'$. If $N'$ is removed from P_A's list in Part 2, since $N'$ is lower ranked than $N^*$, this removal does not threaten P_A's final, optimal match $N^*$.

R1: D receives applications from A, C, D, E. D prefers D (Parent_D) over E, C, A. D admits D. A, C, E rejected. B applies to E, E admits B.
R2: A->A, C->C. E applies to E. E prefers E over B. E rejects B. E admits E.
R3: B->B. B admits B.
Final Stable Match (Part 1): D-D, A-A, B-B, C-C, E-E.

Since Parent_D achieved their Rank 1 choice (Nursery_D), no strategic misrepresentation could yield a better result.

1. Round 1 results in Parent_D being temporarily admitted to Nursery_D (N_D), as N_D prioritizes P_D over P_C. P_C is rejected.

Since the goal is to achieve the highest possible rank on the True Preference List, I must first determine the best achievable outcome.

1.  **Top Choice (Nursery_D):** Parent_C is 4th priority at Nursery_D (behind B, D, E). Parents D and E both rank Nursery_D first and have higher priority than C. If all parents submit truthfully, D accepts P_D in Round 1, rejecting P_C. P_C cannot secure D.

1. Calculate the outcome (POSM) assuming all agents submit truthfully:
   - Round 1: All P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E propose to N_D. N_D admits P_D (priority 2), rejecting P_A, P_C, P_E (P_E is priority 3). P_B proposes to N_E, admitted.

   - Round 3: P_B proposes to N_B, admitted.
   - Final Match (M1): P_E is matched with N_E, their 2nd true choice.

2. Since P_D has higher priority (2nd) than P_E (3rd) at P_E's top choice (N_D) and P_D proposes N_D first, N_D is unattainable for P_E. N_E is the best achievable outcome under stability constraints.

3. Part 2 introduces a refinement based on 'blocking parents.'

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents): The mechanism includes a check for 'Blocking Parents' (Part 2). A Parent is blocking if their temporary match (T) caused rejections but differed from their final match (M). In the stable outcome M, no parent who was temporarily admitted and caused rejections subsequently moved (T=M). Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger, and the outcome remains the stable match M.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (Nursery_E): N_E prefers P_A, P_D, P_E over P_B. Since P_E (priority 3 at N_E) proposes to N_E in Round 2 (after being rejected by N_D), P_E will bump P_B (priority 4) if P_B proposes N_E first. Rank 1 is likely unattainable.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (Nursery_A): N_A prefers P_E, P_C, P_D, P_A over P_B (P_B is lowest priority, 5/5). To secure N_A, P_B must propose to N_A early when N_A is empty, and hope that preferred candidates are matched elsewhere or propose elsewhere.

1.

2. Round 2: P_A -> N_A (admitted). P_C -> N_C (admitted). P_E -> N_E. N_E compares P_B (current) and P_E (new). N_E prefers P_E (3rd priority) over P_B (4th). P_E is admitted; P_B is rejected.

3. **Part 2 Analysis:** I confirmed that in the resulting stable matching M, no parent meets the criteria to be a 'blocking parent' (i.e., causing a rejection AND moving to a different final match). Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger any iteration or change the outcome M.

1. Simulate Part 1 using all agents' True Preference Lists (TPLs).
   P_C's TPL: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B'].
   In Round 1, P_C applies to N_D. N_D receives applications from {A, C, D, E}. P_D has the highest priority (2nd overall, vs P_C's 4th) and is temporarily admitted, rejecting P_C.

   The final assignment using TPLs is M = {(P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E)}. P_C achieves N_C (Rank 2).

2. Check Stability and Part 2 Trigger:
   The matching M is stable. P_C prefers N_D (Rank 1), but N_D prefers its match P_D (P_D is 2nd priority, P_C is 4th). P_C prefers N_E (Rank 3, tied with N_C), but N_E prefers its match P_E (P_E is 3rd priority, P_C is 5th). Since the matching is stable, Part 2 does not trigger any list modifications because no parent meets the criteria of being a 'blocking parent' (i.e., a parent who caused a rejection while temporarily admitted but later moved).

3. Strategic Manipulation:
   Since P_D is higher priority than P_C at N_D and P_D prefers N_D first, P_C cannot displace P_D. Similarly, P_E blocks P_C at N_E. Because the DA algorithm guarantees the Parent-optimal stable matching when preferences are reported truthfully, and this outcome (N_C) is the best stable match P_C can achieve, misreporting preferences will likely result in a strictly worse outcome for P_C.

Any attempt to manipulate the list to force P_D out of N_D by creating a blocking scenario was analyzed and found to result in a worse outcome for Parent_E (3rd or 5th choice) because the manipulation required P_E to sacrifice higher-ranked options, which P_E could not afford given the positions of other parents.

1. Identify the stable matching outcome using true preferences (Part 1):
   Parent A's first choice, Nursery D, receives applications from A, C, D, and E in Round 1. Nursery D prioritizes D (P2) over A (P5). Therefore, Parent A cannot secure Nursery D.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   Since the outcome M* derived from true preferences is stable, there are no blocking pairs. Furthermore, analysis of the temporary admissions showed that no parent satisfied both conditions required to be a 'blocking parent' (causing rejection AND having a different final match). Thus, Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

1. Analysis of True Preferences: Parent_E's highest preference is Nursery_D. However, at Nursery_D, Parent_D has higher priority than Parent_E (D is 2nd, E is 3rd). Since Parent_D also ranks Nursery_D first, Parent_E cannot secure Nursery_D.

   - Parent_A eventually matches with N_A (Rank 2).
   - The resulting stable matching is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   - In the outcome M, every parent is matched to the school they temporarily held at the last step where they caused a rejection (e.g., P_D stayed at N_D, P_E stayed at N_E). Since the final admission (FA) always equals the Temporary Admission (TA) for agents who caused rejections, no 'Blocking Parents' are identified based on the provided definition (Condition 2: FA must differ from TA).
   - Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger any reruns, and the outcome remains the P-optimal stable matching M.

Since Parent_A cannot overcome the priority ranking at N_D, and submitting anything other than the true preference list risks delaying the application to N_A (Rank 2) or lower, leading to a potentially worse match (as demonstrated by testing [B, D, A, E, C] which resulted in Rank 3), the optimal strategy is to submit the true preferences.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

In DAA, submitting the true preference list is a dominant strategy for the proposing agents (Parents) if the goal is to maximize the rank of the matched school on their true preference list, regardless of the preferences of other parents or the priorities of the schools.

I verified this by running the DAA simulation using everyone's true preferences:
1. Parent D secures Nursery D (Prio 2/Rank 1).
2. Parent E is rejected by D (R1) and applies to E (R2). E secures Nursery E because N_E prefers P_E (Prio 3) over P_B (Prio 4), rejecting B.
3. Parent A secures Nursery A (Prio 4/Rank 2, after B is rejected).
4. Parent C secures Nursery C (Rank 2).
5. Parent B, rejected by E (R2) and A (R2 attempt failed due to low priority), applies to B (R3) and secures Nursery B.

Outcome: Parent B matches with Nursery B, which is Rank 3 on Parent B's true preference list ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'].

Analysis showed that Parent B cannot obtain Rank 1 (E) because P_E has higher priority at N_E and will always apply there in R2. Parent B cannot obtain Rank 2 (A) because P_A and P_E have higher priority at N_A.

Since the resulting matching from Part 1 is a stable matching, there are no 'blocking parents' (Part 2 criteria are not met, as parents who caused rejections, like D, stayed put, and parents who moved, like B, did not cause rejections in their temporary holds). Therefore, the DAA outcome is the final outcome.

1. Analyze N_D (Rank 1): N_D prefers Parent D (2nd priority) over Parent C (4th priority). Since Parent D ranks N_D first, Parent D will apply to N_D and will be admitted over Parent C in Round 1. Therefore, N_D is unobtainable for Parent C.
2. Analyze N_C (Rank 2): In the truthful submission scenario (where everyone submits their TPL), Parent C gets rejected from N_D in R1, applies to N_C in R2, and is admitted, resulting in a stable match where Parent C gets N_C (Rank 2).
3. Manipulation Check: Since N_D is blocked by a higher priority parent (P_D) applying first, no manipulation of P_C's list can secure N_D. Submitting a preference list that ranks N_C highly, such as the TPL, ensures P_C gets N_C, which is the best achievable stable outcome.

1. Analyze the outcome under the assumption that all parents submit their True Preference Lists (P_true).
   The DA process shows that Parent D (R2 at D) successfully claims Nursery D (P1 for D) because Parent D has higher priority than Parent E (R3 at D).
   Parent E is rejected by D in R1 and successfully claims Nursery E (P2 for E) in R2, beating Parent B.

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2).
   In the M_DA calculation, Parent B was temporarily admitted at E in R1 but was the only applicant, hence causing no rejection. B moved to B in R3. Since B caused no rejections, B is not a blocking parent. No other parent was temporarily admitted and then moved. Thus, M_DA is the final outcome.

3. Evaluate Strategy-Proofness.
   Since Nursery D is unattainable due to Parent D's superior priority and preference, E's best attainable outcome is Nursery E.

1. Baseline Calculation (True Preferences): Simulating Part 1 of the DA process using everyone's true preferences results in the matching M1: P_A->N_A, P_B->N_B, P_C->N_C, P_D->N_D, P_E->N_E. Parent_B matches with N_B, which is the 3rd choice.

Since P_D has higher priority (2nd) than P_C (4th), P_D will always be admitted over P_C at N_D, provided P_D applies there (which they do as it is their rank 1 choice). Therefore, N_D is unattainable.

2. Targeting Nursery_C (Rank 2): The next best option is N_C. If I submit my true preferences ['D', 'C', 'E', 'A', 'B'], I propose to N_D in R1 and get rejected. In R2, I propose to N_C.

1. Analyze the outcome based on Parent_A's true preferences ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C']:
    a. Parent_A's 1st choice, Nursery_D, is highly competitive. In Round 1, Parent_A (5th priority at D) is rejected in favor of Parent_D (2nd priority at D). Nursery_D is unattainable.
    b. Parent_A proposes to Nursery_A (2nd choice) in Round 2. Although Parent_A is 4th priority at A, the three higher priority parents (P_E, P_C, P_D) are already matched to schools they prefer (N_E, N_C, N_D, respectively) and do not apply to N_A, or apply later and are rejected (like P_B). Parent_A secures N_A.
    c. The resulting stable matching gives Parent_A their 2nd choice, N_A.

2. Analyze the impact of Part 2 (Blocking Parent Adjustment):
    We checked the history of temporary admissions in the truthful run and found no parents who meet the criteria for being a 'blocking parent' (i.e., temporarily admitted, causing a rejection, but ultimately moving elsewhere). Therefore, the stable matching achieved in Part 1 is the final outcome, $P_A 	o N_A$.

3. Strategic Consideration:
    Since $N_D$ is unattainable and $N_A$ is the best achievable stable match, Parent_A should submit their true preferences to ensure they secure $N_A$. Deviating from the true preference order (e.g., trying to secure $N_A$ immediately or manipulating the order to induce beneficial blocking) was shown to either yield the same outcome ($N_A$) or a worse outcome ($N_E$). Therefore, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,2

1. Simulation using True Preferences (Part 1):
   - P_B's True Preferences: [E, A, B, D, C].
   - R1: P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E apply to N_D. P_D admitted (highest priority). P_B applies to N_E (admitted temporarily).

1. Standard DAA Analysis (Assuming all parents submit true preferences):
   - Parent C's top choice, Nursery D, is highly competitive. Parent D (N2 priority at D), Parent E (N3 priority at D), and Parent A (N5 priority at D) all apply to D in Round 1. Parent B (N1 priority at D) applies to E.

In the DA algorithm, submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents), guaranteeing the best possible stable match according to their preferences.

1. DA Simulation (using all true preferences):
   - Round 1: All parents apply to their Rank 1 choices. N_D receives applications from P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E. N_E receives P_B. 
   - N_D Priority (B>D>E>C>A): P_D (P2) is admitted. P_A, P_C, P_E are rejected.

   - N_E: P_E (P3) displaces P_B (P4). P_E admitted, P_B rejected.

2. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check): Part 2 checks for parents who temporarily held a spot but later moved, causing unnecessary rejections.

The DA algorithm, when agents propose, is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing agents. This means that submitting their true preferences maximizes their outcome among all stable matchings.

First, I determine the stable matching (M) resulting from all parents submitting their true preferences (Part 1):
1. R1 Proposals: All P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E -> N_D. P_B -> N_E. N_D admits P_D (highest priority). N_E admits P_B. Rejected: P_A, P_C, P_E.
2. R2 Proposals: P_A -> N_A. P_C -> N_C. P_E -> N_E. N_E holds P_B, receives P_E. N_E admits P_E (higher priority). Rejected: P_B. N_A admits P_A. N_C admits P_C.
3. R3 Proposals: P_B -> N_B. N_B admits P_B.
4. Final Matching M: (P_A, N_A), (P_B, N_B), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E).

P_E is matched with N_E, which is their 2nd choice.

Next, I check if any Parent becomes a 'blocking Parent' according to the definition in Part 2. A blocking parent must have caused a rejection during a temporary admission AND subsequently moved to a different final match. In this specific DA outcome (M):
- P_D caused rejections at N_D but stayed there (not blocking).
- P_B was admitted at N_E in R1 but caused no rejections in R1 (only applicant). P_B moved to N_B, but condition 1 failed.
- P_E caused rejection of P_B at N_E in R2 but stayed there (not blocking).
Since no parent meets both criteria, the matching M is the final stable allocation.

Since P_E cannot obtain their 1st choice (N_D, due to P_D having higher priority), and the mechanism yields the parent-optimal stable matching (N_E) when submitting true preferences, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy for Parent_E.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,2

The standard Parent-Proposing DA is strategy-proof for the parents, meaning submitting the true preference list guarantees the best possible stable match for the parent, regardless of what others submit.

First, I determine Parent_A's best stable outcome by simulating the DA process assuming all parents submit their true preferences:
1. Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_D. However, Parent_A is the lowest priority applicant (5th) at D, and Parent_D (2nd priority) also applies and is accepted in Round 1.
2. In the resulting stable matching, Parent_A is matched with Nursery_A (their 2nd choice).

Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof, Parent_A cannot achieve a better outcome (Nursery_D) by misrepresenting preferences, as Parent_D holds a higher priority at D.

Second, I consider the 'Blocking Parent' rule (Part 2). This rule only triggers if a parent temporarily admitted at a nursery (causing rejections) ultimately moves elsewhere. In the stable matching derived from true preferences, the two parents who caused rejections (P_D at D in R1, P_E at E in R2) both ended up matched to those respective nurseries, meaning no blocking parents are identified.

1. Running the DA algorithm (Part 1) using everyone's true preferences reveals the following stable outcome:
   R1: P_D gets D (rejects P_A, P_C, P_E). P_B gets E (temporarily).
   R2: P_A -> A, P_C -> C, P_E -> E. P_E bumps P_B at E (P_E is higher priority at E). P_A gets A, P_C gets C, P_E gets E. P_B is rejected.

3. Checking Part 2 (Blocking Parents): The temporary matches that caused rejections (P_D at D, P_E at E) resulted in final admissions at the same nurseries. Therefore, no blocking parents are identified, and the procedure ends with the stable matching from Part 1.

4.

2. Fallback: Following rejection, Parent C applies to their second choice, Nursery C, in Round 2 and is admitted (as C is the only applicant to C in R2 based on truthful reporting).
3. Stability Check (Part 2): Since the parents who caused rejections in early rounds (D at D, E at E) remained matched to those schools, no blocking parents are generated, and the match is finalized after Part 1.

1. Round 1: P_A applies to N_D. P_D, P_C, P_E also apply to N_D. P_D has the highest priority at N_D among these applicants and secures the spot. P_A is rejected.
2. P_A moves to N_A (2nd choice) in Round 2. Since P_A's higher priority competitors for N_A (P_E, P_C, P_D) are matched elsewhere (D, C, E, B) or apply elsewhere first, P_A secures N_A.

1. Round 1: P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E apply to D. P_B applies to E. N_D accepts P_D (highest priority). N_E accepts P_B. P_A, P_C, P_E rejected.
2. Round 2: P_A applies to A. P_C applies to C. P_E applies to E. N_A accepts P_A. N_C accepts P_C. N_E accepts P_E (preferred over P_B), rejecting P_B.
3. Round 3: P_B applies to B. N_B accepts P_B.
Final Match (M1): (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).
Parent_C matches with Nursery_C (Rank 2). Since Parent_C cannot displace P_D at N_D (Rank 1) due to lower priority, Rank 2 is the best achievable outcome. Submitting the true list achieves this result.",True,Nursery_C,True,True,2

The standard DAA is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (Parents), guaranteeing that submitting true preferences leads to the Parent-optimal stable matching. 

1. I first ran the DAA (Part 1) assuming all parents submit their true preferences, including Parent_D: ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_E'].
2. In Round 1, Parent_D applied to N_D along with P_A, P_C, and P_E. Based on N_D's priority list ([P_B, P_D, P_E, P_C, P_A]), P_D had the highest priority among the applicants and was temporarily admitted to N_D.
3. The resulting stable matching (M_Stable) assigned Parent_D to N_D (Rank 1).
4. Since Parent_D achieved their top preference, manipulation cannot yield a better outcome.
5. Furthermore, analyzing the trace of Part 1 showed that no Parent admitted temporarily later moved away while having caused a rejection. Therefore, no blocking parents were identified, and Part 2 did not modify the submitted lists. 

Submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy, securing the Rank 1 choice.",True,Nursery_D,True,True,1

The DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing agents (parents), meaning that submitting the true preference list guarantees the highest possible outcome for the parent among all stable matchings, provided the resulting matching is stable and final. 

1. Simulation using True Preferences: If Parent_E submits ['Nursery_D', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A'], the DA process yields the following stable assignment:
    * R1: P_E applies to N_D, rejected by P_D (higher priority).
    * R2: P_E applies to N_E. N_E accepts P_E (E > B priority) and rejects P_B.
    * R3: P_B applies to N_B, accepted.
    * Final Outcome (Part 1): P_E is matched with N_E (Rank 2).

2. Blocking Parent Check (Part 2): We check if any parent was temporarily admitted at a nursery but moved elsewhere, causing others to be rejected. In this outcome, P_D secured N_D and stayed there. P_E secured N_E and stayed there. Since the temporary admission equals the final admission for all parents who caused rejections, no blocking parents are found. The outcome is final.

3. Conclusion: Since the DA process is strategy-proof and the complex Part 2 mechanism does not alter the outcome derived from the true preferences in this specific case, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy to maximize Parent_E's outcome (N_E, Rank 2). Any deviation tested led to a worse outcome.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,2
