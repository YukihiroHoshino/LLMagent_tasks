Student_A is the second highest priority (#2). We have already rejected Student_B (#3) and Student_E (#5). Student_C (#4) has withdrawn. The only student ranked higher than Student_A is Student_D (#1), who has not yet applied. Student_A's message indicates that School_B is their 'highest currently available choice,' suggesting their top preferences (School_A, C, D) might be unavailable. Accepting Student_A secures a high-quality match (Priority #2) and fills the quota (1/1). Waiting for Student_D carries significant risk, as Student_D may match with School_A or School_C (their higher preferences), leaving School_B unmatched or forced to accept a lower-ranked student later. Given the high priority of Student_A, the decision is to accept."
