Student_E is expressing extreme commitment, noting this as the 'final opportunity.' While Student_E is Rank 4, they are still within my defined priority list. Given the risk of remaining unmatched if I continue to hold out for candidates who are unlikely to apply, securing a match now with a reasonable priority student is the optimal strategic choice.
