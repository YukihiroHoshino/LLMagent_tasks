I have applied twice before and been rejected, but given that the market is now nearly cleared, School_E must accept me if it wishes to fill its quota, assuming the higher priority students (A, C, B) have successfully matched elsewhere. I will submit a final, formal application, emphasizing my commitment to secure the match."

While Student_E is available and applying for the third time, it is only Round 5, and I still have 1 quota remaining. Accepting Student_E now would secure a match but prevent me from matching with my top three choices (A, C, B) should they become available later. Given that the market is still active, despite Student_E's implication that the process is concluding, I must prioritize holding out for a higher-ranked student. Therefore, I will reject Student_E again to keep my quota open."

School_E (Rank 5) is the only remaining option on my preference list and the only unmatched school in the market. I have applied to School_E four times and been rejected every time, even though I am ranked 4th on their priority list. Given that the market is effectively closed except for School_E, it is highly probable that School_E's higher priority students (A, C, B) have secured matches elsewhere (otherwise, School_E would have matched earlier). I must apply again, making a final, strong appeal based on market closure and mutual necessity, since being unmatched is my least preferred outcome."

In previous rounds, I rejected Student_E, presumably hoping for higher-ranked students (A, C, B) to apply. It is now Round 6. Student_E claims that School_E is the 'sole remaining high school seeking a student in this cycle,' suggesting that students A, C, and B are likely matched elsewhere, or have exhausted their options and are not applying to me. If this assessment of the market status is accurate, Student_E is the highest-ranked available student remaining on my list. Accepting Student_E secures a match (Rank 4) and fulfills my quota, preventing me from potentially remaining unmatched or having to accept Student_D (Rank 5). Given the late stage of the process, it is prudent to accept this match."
