While Student_D (1st priority) has not yet applied, accepting Student_A guarantees a high-quality match and secures my quota. Waiting for Student_D is risky, as they might have matched elsewhere (School_C or School_A rank them highly). Therefore, accepting Student_A is the optimal strategic decision."

Since Schools A, B, C, and D are matched (implying Students A, B, C, and D are matched), the three students ranked higher than me at School_E (Student_A, Student_C, Student_B) must have secured spots elsewhere.
