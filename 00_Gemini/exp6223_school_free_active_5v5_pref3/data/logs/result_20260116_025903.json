We must, unfortunately, maintain our decision to keep our limited quota open at this time. We wish you success in securing a placement.",
              "thought": "Student_E is ranked 4th on School_E's priority list (['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D']). My goal is to secure a student as high as possible. Although Student_E is applying aggressively for the third time, indicating desperation (likely rejected by their higher preferences C, B, A, and possibly D), accepting them now closes the door on matching with my top three choices: Student_A (1st), Student_C (2nd), and Student_B (3rd). Since the market is still relatively active (Round 5), there is a reasonable chance that one of the higher priority students will eventually be rejected by their top schools and turn to School_E. I will maintain selectivity and reject Student_E again to keep the quota open for a higher-ranked candidate."

I have exhausted all other highly preferred options which are now matched. I am fully prepared to commit immediately and exclusively to School E. Recognizing my position (4th) on your priority list, and the fact that higher-ranked students are likely matched elsewhere, I believe I am now your strongest available candidate. I formally apply now, seeking a binding and final placement agreement.",
              "thought": "The market appears to be nearly closed. All schools ranked higher than School_E (School_C, School_B, School_A, School_D) are no longer available/matched, as they are not listed in the 'High schools not yet matched' list. This means School_E (Rank 5) is the only remaining option for Student_E. Although School_E has rejected me three times, it is on my preference list, and matching with it is preferred over remaining unmatched. Furthermore, if School_A, School_C, and School_B have all filled their quota, Student_E is likely the highest-ranked remaining available student on School_E's priority list (where E is 4th). I must leverage the market scarcity and my final commitment to secure this match. I will send a definitive [APPLY] message."

Student_E (Rank 4) has applied repeatedly and is now applying for the fourth time, claiming that higher-ranked options are exhausted in the market. Since it is Round 6, and I have consistently rejected Student_E to hold out for A, C, or B, the risk of failing to secure any match, or only securing Student_D (Rank 5), is increasing. Student_E's commitment is strong, and securing Rank 4 is significantly better than risking Rank 5 or zero matches. It is strategically sound to accept this committed student now given the late stage of negotiations and the likelihood that my top priorities have settled elsewhere."
