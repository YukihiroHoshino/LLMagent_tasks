Simultaneously, Student_D has an outstanding, confirmed offer from School_C (Rank 1), which School_C repeatedly affirmed as 'firm and unconditional' but has not finalized system-wide, likely due to capacity constraints if School_C matched its highest priority student (Student_C). The current instruction lists School_D as the only high school not yet matched, which contradicts the history but must be followed. Since the match with School_D is recorded as definitive by both parties (Student_D gave irrevocable acceptance), the appropriate action is to maintain the status quo by sending a [TALK] message, acknowledging the finalized match. This prevents any unintended reversal of the guaranteed position (School_D) while the market mechanisms resolve the status of the higher preference (School_C/B)."
