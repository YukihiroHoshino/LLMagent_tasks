I successfully applied to and accepted an offer from School_E (P5), and the match was confirmed and registered in the previous rounds.\n\nThe 'Current Situation' lists School_E as the only high school not yet matched, which contradicts the explicit history stating the match is 'finalized and secured' and 'officially registered'. However, since I must select a target from the available list, and School_E is the school I am matched with, I will send a final confirmation message. Following the successful pattern established in the history (where I used [APPLY] to confirm acceptance/registration), I will use [APPLY] again to ensure the system recognizes the finalized match status for Round 11."

Student_E is sending this final [APPLY] to ensure the match is officially registered by the system. Despite Student_E being low priority, reneging on a match that was verbally confirmed multiple times in previous rounds is detrimental to market stability and my reputation, and risks leaving the quota unfilled if the higher priority students are already matched elsewhere (as implied by Student_E's earlier statements). Since the current situation still lists Matched Students: [], I must send the final [ACCEPT] to officially register the match and fill my quota, honoring the commitment made."
