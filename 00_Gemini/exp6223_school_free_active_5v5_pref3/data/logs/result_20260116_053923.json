Since it is still early (Round 4) and I have my full quota of 1 remaining, accepting a lower-ranked student like Student_E would prevent me from matching with a higher-priority candidate later. Student_E also ranks School_E last (5th), suggesting they are likely applying widely. I will reject this application to keep my quota open for better matches."

I have applied once previously and was rejected. Given that all other schools (A, B, C, D) are now matched (capacity 1 each), it is highly probable that the students ranked higher than me on School_E's priority list (Student_A, Student_C, Student_B) have secured matches elsewhere. This means Student_E is now likely the highest priority applicant available to School_E. I must re-apply immediately to secure this match, as it is my final option."

I have a quota of 1 and am currently unmatched. Student_E is applying for the second time (after a previous rejection), indicating strong commitment, and suggesting they may have exhausted options higher on their preference list (School_C, School_B, School_A, School_D). Since Round 5 is underway and the higher-ranked students (A, C, B) have not applied, holding out carries the risk of remaining unmatched or only matching with Student_D (Rank 5). Securing a solid match with Student_E (Rank 4) at this stage is a prudent move, especially since my school generally ranks low on student preference lists. I will accept this binding match."
