Despite the system listing School_C as 'not yet matched' (which contradicts the dialogue history), the established relationship is one of secured enrollment. Since this is Round 30, the final round, I must maintain the confirmed commitment and focus on the imminent start of the academic year, using the [TALK] tag to acknowledge the completion of the pre-arrival communication phase."

We deeply appreciate your meticulous preparation and your unwavering commitment to School_C. We consider all necessary pre-arrival communication complete and look forward with great excitement to officially welcoming you and commencing the academic year as a secured, enrolled student. Safe travels, and we anticipate your arrival!",

Student_E is contacting me with the [TALK] tag, confirming final preparations for arrival and considering pre-arrival communication complete. Since the student used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. Given that this is the final round and I have quota, maintaining the commitment to Student_E (who is confirmed to be ready to enroll) is strategically sound, especially since my higher priority candidates (C, B, D) are not currently available or applying. I will provide a final congratulatory confirmation."
