Given the lack of applications from higher-ranked students (B, D, A, E) and the depth of the simulation history, it is highly probable that my higher-ranked candidates have matched elsewhere.\n\nRejecting Student_C now carries a significant risk of ending the simulation unmatched, which is the worst outcome (implicitly Rank 6).
