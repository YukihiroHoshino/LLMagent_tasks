              "thought": "I am School_C with a quota of 1. My goal is to match with the highest priority student. My True Priority List ranks Student_C as #1. Student_C has applied this round with the [APPLY] tag. Given that Student_C is my highest priority candidate and I have capacity, accepting this application secures the optimal outcome for School_C. Although previous interactions with Student_C resulted in temporary agreements that did not finalize (as indicated by 'Matched Students: []'), securing them now is the best strategic move."
