My goal is to match with the highest possible priority student: Student_B (Rank 1), Student_D (Rank 2), Student_A (Rank 3), Student_E (Rank 4), Student_C (Rank 5). I currently have 1 quota and no matches.\nStudent_A (Rank 3) and Student_E (Rank 4) have applied this round. Accepting Student_A would secure a Rank 3 match, which is better than Rank 4, but sacrifices the chance for Rank 1 or Rank 2.\nSince this is only Round 4 and I have rejected applicants previously, I must assume that Student_B and Student_D might still be available or could apply later. Accepting Rank 3 now is premature if I am aiming for Rank 1 or 2.\nI will reject Student_A again to keep my options open for higher-ranked students, despite Student_A's correct analysis that they are the highest available applicant currently applying to me (A is Rank 3, E is Rank 4)."

Although School_A has rejected Student_A four times, standard DA strategy dictates continuing to propose to the highest acceptable choice until matched or rejected down the list, especially since School_A is still listed as unmatched. Based on the market clearing (Schools B, C, D are implicitly matched), Student_A is likely the highest available candidate for School_A (whose top two priorities are likely gone). I must press this advantage one last time. If rejected in Round 5, I will secure the guaranteed match with School_E (Rank 5 and Student_A's Rank 1 priority) in Round 6 to avoid remaining unmatched.
