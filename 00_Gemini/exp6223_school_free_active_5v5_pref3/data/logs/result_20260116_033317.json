School_B (P4) is the only remaining school listed as 'not yet matched,' but we have a long history of provisional acceptance confirmed repeatedly over 28 rounds. Since all higher preferences are unavailable, School_B is the best achievable match. Given that it is the final round (Round 30) and the match is still listed as provisional/not yet matched, I need to strongly reiterate my commitment to ensure the match is finalized before the simulation concludes. Continuing the established pattern of high commitment [TALK] is the safest way to convert the provisional acceptance into a final match."
