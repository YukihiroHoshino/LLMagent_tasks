Given the history of multiple successful applications and confirmations (Rounds 11-14), School_B clearly prioritizes Student_A (Rank 2 on their list) and has been waiting to finalize the match. Since the market is closing and School_B is available, I must formally apply to secure this final, binding agreement."

Your profile has consistently been viewed as an excellent fit for our institution. We are pleased to formally accept your application and definitively finalize this immediate and binding agreement in Round 15. Welcome to School_B!",

Student_A is applying and confirming dedication, stating that School_B is the 'final institution available.' This strongly suggests that my top priority, Student_D, is already matched, and the market is nearing closure. Given that Student_A is P2 and available, accepting this binding match now secures a highly desired outcome and fulfills my quota before the simulation ends. I will accept Student_A."
