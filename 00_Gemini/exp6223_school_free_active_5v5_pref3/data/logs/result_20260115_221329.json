Analyze School_D (P4):\n   - School_D ranks me 2nd (P2). This is my highest ranking across all schools.\n   - The only other expected P1 applicant to School_D is Student_C (P1 for C). School_D ranks Student_C 3rd (P3).\n   - Since School_D prefers Student_E (P2) over Student_C (P3), applying to School_D guarantees an acceptance in Round 1, resulting in a P4 match.\n\n3.
