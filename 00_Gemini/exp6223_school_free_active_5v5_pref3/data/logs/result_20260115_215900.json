Student_B has applied immediately and listed School_B as their top preference. While I prefer Student_D (Rank 1) or Student_A (Rank 2), neither has applied this round. Furthermore, Student_D ranks me 3rd, and Student_A ranks me 4th, suggesting they are pursuing higher preference schools (School_C/A and School_A/C, respectively). If I reject Student_B, Student_B might apply to their 3rd choice, School_A, where they are School_A's #1 priority, making a match highly likely. Losing Student_B (Rank 3) for the uncertain prospect of securing D or A (who rank me low) is too risky in Round 1. Securing a reliable Rank 3 match now is the optimal conservative strategy."
