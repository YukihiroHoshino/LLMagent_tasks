I have been rejected by my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices (School_C, School_B, School_A). The only remaining school listed as unmatched is School_E. Since School_E is on my preference list (5th choice), and I prefer matching with any school on my list over remaining unmatched, I must formally apply to School_E now. I will make a direct application, focusing on my commitment, as securing a match is paramount at this stage.\n\nSchool_E's priority for me is 4th (['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D']). Given that most other high-priority students for School_E (A, C, B) are likely matched elsewhere or have already rejected School_E, I have a reasonable chance of acceptance."

Since School_E previously rejected me but is still unmatched, it means they were holding out for higher priority students (Student_A, Student_C, or Student_B, who rank above me, Student_E, on School_E's list). Given that School_E is still unmatched in Round 5, it is highly likely those higher-priority students have matched elsewhere.
