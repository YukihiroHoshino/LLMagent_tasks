School_D receives applications from me (P2) and Student_C (P3). School_D accepts me.\n\nMatching with my 4th choice (School_D) immediately is superior to being rejected by my top three choices and being forced into matching with my 5th choice (School_E) in subsequent rounds.

I have been rejected by my top three choices (D, A, B), and based on the 'Current Situation' stating that only School_E is unmatched, it is highly probable that Schools D, A, B, and C have all secured matches. School_E is my last preferred option, but it is the only remaining viable school. I must secure a match here to avoid being unmatched.\n\nSchool_E's priority list is ['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D']. I am the second priority. Since School_A, School_B, School_C, and School_D are matched, it implies that four students (likely including Student_A, who is priority #1 for School_E) are matched elsewhere. Therefore, I am likely the highest-ranked available student for School_E. I will formally apply to secure this match immediately."

Although School_E is Student_C's last preference, Student_C has formally applied ([APPLY]). Given that securing my #1 choice (Student_A) is highly unlikely (as School_E is also Student_A's last choice), and it is already Round 4, accepting my #2 priority student is a prudent and optimal strategy to fulfill my quota with a highly desired candidate. I will accept the application."
