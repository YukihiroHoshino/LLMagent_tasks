Since Student_C sent a [TALK] message, I must respond with [TALK]. Given the extreme persistence of their messages indicating satisfaction elsewhere, it is highly improbable they will apply, and I should acknowledge their status politely while focusing on any potential applicants in the final round."

Since the goal is to match with a high school as high as possible on the preference list, and School_D is the highest, Student_C should maintain this stable match.\nSchool_E is the only remaining unmatched school, and it is Student_C's lowest preference (Preference #5). Applying to School_E would only be detrimental.\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to continue sending a [TALK] message to School_E, confirming satisfaction with the current placement and signaling unavailability, thereby ensuring the stability of the match with School_D as the simulation concludes."
