However, since the market has progressed and two schools (A and D) are now matched, it is highly likely that some of the students ranked higher than me by School_C (Student_C or Student_D) are now matched and out of the running, thus improving my priority standing at School_C.\n\nSchool_C's priority list is: ['Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_D', 'Student_E', 'Student_A']. If Student_C and Student_D are matched elsewhere, Student_E (me) becomes the second-highest priority applicant after Student_B.\n\nRational Student Behavior Prediction:\nStudent_A's top remaining choice is School_C.\nStudent_B's top remaining choice is School_B.\n\nIf Student_A applies to School_C and Student_B applies to School_B:\nSchool_C receives applications from Student_A and Student_E (me).\nSchool_C prefers Student_E over Student_A (E is ranked #4, A is ranked #5 overall). \n\nApplying to School_C offers the highest chance of securing my top remaining preference, provided the higher-ranked applicants are gone and Student_B targets School_B."
