If Student_D and Student_A are no longer available to School_B, I become their highest-ranked remaining candidate (P#1 available). Given that we are in Round 4, it is time to press for a decision. I will apply one final time, emphasizing my unwavering commitment and readiness to accept immediately, forcing them to either accept their best remaining option (me) or risk remaining unmatched."

Student_B has applied three times, stating School_B is their 'undisputed top choice' and promising immediate acceptance if offered admission. This guarantees a stable match.\n\nWhile I prefer Student_D (R1) and Student_A (R2), neither has applied. We are in Round 4, and continuing to reject a high-priority, guaranteed match (R3) in hopes of attracting R1 or R2, who show low preference for School_B (A is R4 preference, D is R3 preference), becomes increasingly risky. Student_B is a strong match, and securing R3 now is the optimal strategy to maximize utility given the uncertainty of R1/R2 applying.\n\nTherefore, I will accept Student_B."

Student_E is applying again in Round 6, stating that I am the only available institution and offering absolute commitment. This implies the market is highly saturated, and the likelihood of Student_A (Rank 1) or Student_C (Rank 2) applying now is very low, as they likely matched with higher preferences (School A, C, D, B). Remaining unmatched (Rank 6) is the worst outcome. Securing Student_E (Rank 4) is a reasonable outcome given the severe market constraints suggested by the student's message. I will accept Student_E now to fulfill my quota before the simulation ends or Student_E finds an alternative (however unlikely their claim suggests)."
