I have 1 remaining quota and currently 0 matched students. Student_A is ranked 3rd on my list.\n\nIn previous rounds, I rejected Student_A (Rank 3) to hold out for Student_B (Rank 1) or Student_D (Rank 2). However, neither B nor D has applied in this round, and Student_A is applying with a definitive 'one last time' ultimatum, indicating high commitment and a strong risk of leaving the market if rejected again.\n\nWhile Student_B and Student_D are higher ranked, waiting another round risks losing Student_A permanently and potentially remaining unmatched if B and D secure matches elsewhere (which is likely, given their preferences for other schools). Since Student_A is a high-quality candidate (Rank 3) and is highly motivated (Rank 1 preference for School_A), securing this match now fulfills the quota and mitigates risk. I will accept Student_A."
