While I ideally seek Student_D or Student_A, securing a match with a high-preference student who is ranked 3rd on my list is a strong outcome, especially since I only have one quota. Rejecting Student_B (a sure thing) to gamble on higher-ranked students (who have strong competing options at their preferred schools) carries significant risk of ending up unmatched or matching with someone lower. I will secure this positive match now."

However, I must check their preferences for School_C:\n1. Student_C's preference for School_C is P4.\n2. Student_B's preference for School_C is P5 (last).\n\nSince both higher priority students rank School_C very low, they are extremely unlikely to target it in Round 1, preferring their P1 or P2 schools (Student_C: School_D/School_A; Student_B: School_B/School_D).\n\nThe only other likely applicant is Student_E (P1 for E), who ranks below me (P4 vs my P3 at School_C).\n\nTherefore, applying to School_C in Round 1 offers the highest chance of securing my P1 match immediately.
