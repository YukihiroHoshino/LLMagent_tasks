The only school remaining unmatched is School_E (Rank 5, my lowest preference).\n\nSince I believe my match with my top choice (School_D) is secured, there is no strategic benefit in applying to School_E. I am required to interact with a school from the unmatched list. I will send a polite [TALK] message to maintain a professional relationship but signal no intent to apply or commit, as my primary placement is secured."

Please allow me to clarify: we are *not* yet finalizing our admissions cohort. In fact, we hold you in extremely high regard based on your profile and our discussions. You remain one of our absolute top candidates for this cycle. We strongly encourage you to formalize your interest in School_E soon, as we anticipate making our final decision regarding our single available seat shortly. We look forward to hearing from you again.",
              "thought": "Student_C is my second highest priority (#2/5). Although School_E is Student_C's last choice (#5/5), Student_C continues to engage in conversation, even in Round 20. The current message sounds like a polite sign-off, suggesting they might be close to matching elsewhere, or are waiting for a final decision from their top choices. Since they used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]. My strategy is to counter the 'farewell' tone, confirm their high standing in my applicant pool, and subtly encourage them to formalize their interest ([APPLY]) before my single quota position is filled by another top candidate (like Student_A, my #1 priority). I need to keep Student_C engaged as a strong backup."

              "thought": "I am Student_C. My top preference, School_D (P1), has repeatedly confirmed my secured placement but continues to defer final documentation due to 'administrative processing.' This match is highly likely, but not finalized in the conversational environment.\nSchool_E (P5) is the only school listed as unmatched. In our previous interaction, School_E was extremely encouraging, stating I am an 'absolute top candidate' and 'strongly encourag[ing] [me] to formalize [my] interest... soon.'\nSince School_E is the only available option, and they are actively soliciting an application, securing this fallback position is crucial, especially given the prolonged administrative delay with School_D. I will formally apply to School_E to guarantee a placement, even if it is my lowest preference, should School_D's match unexpectedly dissolve. This is a strategic move to ensure I am matched."

              "thought": "Student_C is the second highest priority student on School_E's list (Rank #2: ['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D']). Given that we are in Round 21 and only have one quota slot, securing a highly ranked student immediately is the optimal strategy, despite Student_C listing School_E as their last choice. Waiting for the Rank #1 student (Student_A) carries significant risk, as Student_A is also likely to have matched elsewhere by now, or Student_C might match with another institution if rejected here. I have previously encouraged Student_C to apply, so accepting this application is consistent with our history and secures a strong outcome."
