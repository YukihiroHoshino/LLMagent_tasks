While I acknowledge the competitive nature of the previous round, I want to reiterate my dedication and commitment to joining your institution. As the final opportunity for both of us to achieve a match, I sincerely hope you will reconsider my profile and extend an offer of acceptance.",

All my higher choices (C, B, and presumably A and D, as they are not listed as available) have rejected me or matched elsewhere. The only school remaining available is School_E (Rank 5 on my list). Although School_E rejected my previous application, the market has now cleared entirely, leaving School_E as the only option for both of us to achieve a match.\nSchool_E ranks me 4th (ahead of Student_D). Assuming their top 3 priorities (A, C, B) have matched elsewhere, I am now their highest available candidate. I must submit a formal application [APPLY] to secure the match, as remaining unmatched is my worst outcome."

After careful consideration of the evolving market situation and your demonstrated commitment to our institution, we are pleased to inform you that we are extending an offer of admission at this time.

We are in Round 4, and I have previously rejected Student_E, who is now reapplying. This indicates that Student_E has likely been rejected by their higher preferences (School_C, School_B, School_A, School_D) and is serious about matching with me. Since my top three choices (A, C, B) have not applied to me, and the risk of remaining unmatched increases significantly in later rounds, securing a match with my 4th preferred student (Student_E) is the best strategic move to maximize utility. I will accept this application."
