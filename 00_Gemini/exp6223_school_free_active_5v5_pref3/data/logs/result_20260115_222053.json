School_E is the last remaining option on my preference list (Rank 5). Since I prefer matching over remaining unmatched, and School_E is still on my list, I must apply. Furthermore, School_E ranks me highly (Student_C is Rank 2 on School_E's priority list), giving me a very high likelihood of acceptance. I will use the [APPLY] tag."

My priority list is ['Student_A' (Rank 1), 'Student_C' (Rank 2), 'Student_B' (Rank 3), 'Student_E' (Rank 4), 'Student_D' (Rank 5)]. Student_C, my Rank 2 student, has submitted an official [APPLY]. While Student_A is my top priority, Student_A ranks School_E last (Rank 5) and is likely pursuing higher options. Securing Student_C, who is a highly desired candidate (Rank 2), is an excellent outcome, especially since Student_C ranks School_E last and might match elsewhere quickly if rejected. Given the risk associated with waiting for Student_A, I will accept Student_C immediately to fulfill my quota with a high-priority student."
