If I reject Student_B, they are very likely to be accepted by School_A or School_C, permanently removing them from the market. Since my higher-ranked students (D and A) are unlikely to apply in Round 1 (B is their 3rd and 4th choice, respectively), rejecting a committed Rank 3 student who is highly competitive risks ending up with no match or a much lower-ranked student later.
