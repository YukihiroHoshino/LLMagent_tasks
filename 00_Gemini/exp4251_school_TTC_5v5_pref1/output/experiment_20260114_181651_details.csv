If Student A applies to School B (Rank 1 choice), School B must identify Student A, regardless of whether identification is restricted to applicants or includes all students, because A is P1 everywhere. Since A applies to B, and B identifies A, the closed loop (Student A -> School B -> Student A) is guaranteed to form in Step 1.

2. Feasibility of P1 (School_A): To secure School_A, I must ensure that Student_A (who is preferred over me by School_A) does not apply to School_A or is matched elsewhere.

3. Student_A's Behavior: Student_A's true P1 is School_B. Since Student_A is the highest priority student overall, if Student_A applies to School_B, they will secure the match immediately (S_A -> H_B, H_B identifies S_A, closed loop). Assuming rational behavior, Student_A will list School_B first.

4. My Application: If I submit truthfully and list School_A as P1, I apply to School_A.

I analyzed the matching process assuming all students submit their true preferences. Since the higher priority students (A, B, C, D) all prefer different schools (B, A, C, D, respectively) over School E (which is ranked 4th or 5th by them), they are matched sequentially to those schools in earlier rounds (R1: A->B, R2: B->A, R3: C->C, R4: D->D).

Since Student A is unadmitted and highest priority, any High School H that Student A applies to will identify Student A. This immediately creates a closed loop (Student A applies to H, H identifies Student A). Students involved in such a closed loop are permanently matched.

1. School_B (S_C's 2nd choice) will be taken by Student_A (highest priority) in Step 1, as S_A applies to B and B identifies S_A.
2. School_C (S_C's 1st choice) will be targeted by Student_B (2nd highest priority) in Step 2 (since S_A takes B). S_B prefers C next, applies to C, and C identifies S_B (B > C in priority). Thus, S_C is blocked from School_C.

Since S_C is blocked from School_C and School_B by higher priority students targeting those schools, the best achievable outcome is School_A (3rd choice).

2. Rounds 1-3: Students A, B, and C (higher priority) will be matched first. In each round, the highest remaining student (A, then B, then C) will be identified by every remaining school.

Since all schools share the same strict priority list (Student_A > Student_B > Student_C > ...), the higher priority students (A and B) will dominate school identifications early on.

I analyzed the outcome of submitting my truthful preferences (starting with School_C):

Since Student C is priority #3 at all schools, Student C must analyze how students A (P1) and B (P2) resolve their matches in Step 1.

1. True Preferences Submission Analysis:
   - A applies to B. B applies to A.
   - School B receives A's application and identifies A (P1).
   - School A receives B's application and identifies A (P1). Since A applied to B, A is removed from A's pool quickly, allowing A to identify B (P2).
   - A and B form closed loops (A->B->A and B->A->B) and are matched (A to B, B to A) in Step 1, regardless of C's actions, as they are higher priority.

2. C's Match with School C:
   - If C applies to C (True Rank 1), School C identifies A (P1). A is matched to B. School C then identifies B (P2). B is matched to A. School C finally identifies C (P3). Since C applied to C, a closed loop (C->C->C) is formed, and C is matched to School C in Step 1.

3. Conclusion:
   Since submitting the true preference list ['School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A', 'School_D', 'School_E'] results in Student C achieving their True Rank 1 choice (School C), which is the best possible outcome, no strategic deviation is necessary or beneficial.",True,School_C,True,True,1

Submitting the true preference list ['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_E'] ensures that S_D applies to School D in every round. When S_D becomes P1 among remaining students in Round 4, S_D applies to D, D identifies S_D, resulting in a match (S_D, D), achieving the Rank 1 outcome.

1. Analyze the market configuration for Student_E's top choice (School_E):
   - Student_E applies to School_E (Rank 1).
   - School_E's priority list ranks Student_E last ([A, B, C, D, E]).

Analysis of the truthful submission scenario reveals that the higher priority students (A, B, C, D) successfully match with their preferred schools (B, A, C, D respectively) in rounds 1 through 4, because they apply to a school that identifies them (or the highest remaining priority student).

1. Students A, B, and C (the higher priority students) apply to Schools B, A, and C, respectively (their top choices).

   - School_B identifies Student_A (only applicant).
   - School_C identifies Student_C (only applicant).

   - Student_B applied to School_A, School_A identified Student_B. Loop B->A->B. B matches to A.
   - Student_C applied to School_C, School_C identified Student_C. Loop C->C. C matches to C.
   - And similarly for D and E.

1. Universal Priority: Student_A is ranked highest by every single school (School_A, B, C, D, E).

This forms a closed loop (A applies to B, B identifies A), resulting in a permanent match (A, School_B).

2. Since each school receives only one application, and capacity is 1, a closed loop forms immediately for every student with their top choice.
3. Result: S_D matches with School_D (Rank 1).

I must predict the assignments of the higher-priority students based on their true preferences (assuming they also act optimally or truthfully, which often converges in these sequential mechanisms):
1. R1: A applies to B. All schools identify A. Loop A->B->A closes. (A, B) matched.

5. Optimal Strategy: S_C must design a Choice Ranking List that applies to schools guaranteed to reject S_C in R1 and R2 (by identifying S_A and S_B, respectively), thus moving S_C down the list until School_A is reached in R3, when S_C is the highest priority remaining student.

Submitting the true preference list yields S_E's Rank 1 choice (School_E).

3. Round 2 Dynamics: With S_A removed, Student B becomes the highest priority student (P1) among all remaining students. Any remaining school (including School_A) that Student B applies to will identify Student B, guaranteeing a match.

1. Analyze S_A and S_B's incentives: S_A's TPL is [B, A, C, D, E]. S_B's TPL is [A, C, B, E, D]. Both S_A and S_B can secure their Rank 1 choices (School_B and School_A, respectively) by applying truthfully, as their applications do not conflict (S_A->B, S_B->A).
