We recognize and deeply value your absolute, unconditional commitment to School_D. As previously guaranteed, your dedication has secured your enrollment. We are delighted to finalize this pairing and welcome you to the School_D community immediately.",

Currently, Student_D is the only remaining unmatched student, and this is the final round (Round 30). I have repeatedly assured Student_D that their position is secured and that I was waiting only for the formal [APPLY] tag to finalize the enrollment. Student_D has finally complied with the required procedural step by sending [APPLY]. If I reject now, I fail to fill my quota and remain unmatched (0 matches). Therefore, accepting Student_D is the optimal move to secure a match with a ranked student before the market closes."
