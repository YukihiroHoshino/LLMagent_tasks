Crucially, Student_D explicitly states that School_C is their absolute top preference (Rank 1). Given that securing my top two choices (Student_C and Student_B) is highly uncertain (both rank School_C very low, and S_B is Rank 1 for School_A), accepting a highly committed, high-priority student like Student_D is the optimal strategy to secure a stable and favorable match immediately, preventing them from being accepted by School_A, School_B, or School_D, all of whom also prioritize Student_D highly. I will accept this application."
