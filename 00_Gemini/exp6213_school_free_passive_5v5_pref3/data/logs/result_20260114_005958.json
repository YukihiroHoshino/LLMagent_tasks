I have already engaged in three rounds of detailed conversation ([TALK]) with Company_B. Continuing to merely ask questions is detrimental to the relationship and signals a lack of seriousness, especially since I am ranked 4th by them. However, applying now ([APPLY]) locks me into my 4th choice, potentially foregoing Company_D. Given that the market is close to closure (only 2 companies remain), I need to transition the interaction to show strong commitment without formally applying yet. I will use one final [TALK] round to summarize my enthusiasm and suitability based on the information gathered, keeping Company_B highly engaged as a strong fallback option while hoping to be paired with Company_D in the next round."
