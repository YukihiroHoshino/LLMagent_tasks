Seeker_C is reiterating extreme commitment, calling Company_B their 'absolute top priority' and stating they are 'ready to commit immediately.' While I previously rejected their application, the current market situation (A and B likely matched or unavailable) makes P3 an excellent outcome. Since Seeker_C sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. My strategy is to confirm that we are ready to hire them based on their commitment and encourage them strongly to formalize the match in the next interaction, securing this valuable placement before they commit to their P1 choice (Company_C). I will indicate that no further information is needed, signaling immediate readiness to accept."
