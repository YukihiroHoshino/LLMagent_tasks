Regarding extracurriculars, we offer competitive programs like our nationally ranked Robotics Team and our Model UN delegation, which consistently wins regional awards. For unique engagement, our specialized program is the 'Impact Initiative': instead of generalized volunteering, students select a specific local non-profit partner in their field of interest (e.g., environment, technology, or education) and commit to a year-long project designed to produce measurable results. This ensures deep, meaningful community involvement tailored to individual passions. Does this level of specialized engagement align well with the interests you are pursuing?",
