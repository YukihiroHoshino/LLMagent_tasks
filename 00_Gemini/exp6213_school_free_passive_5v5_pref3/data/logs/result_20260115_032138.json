The current situation indicates that School A, B, D, and E are matched, leaving School C as the only remaining high school. Since School E, B, and A are unavailable, School C is the highest possible match remaining for me. Given that all other students (A, B, C, D) must have matched with the other four schools, School C's priority list (A>B>C>D>E) dictates that Student E is the highest (and only) remaining applicant. I have applied twice previously without success, likely because School C was waiting for a higher priority student. Now that the higher priority students are matched elsewhere, School C must accept me if it wishes to fill its quota. I must apply one last time to secure this match, as it is my best available outcome."
