We believe this level of individualized support is unmatched and ensures that students like you, who are dedicated to advanced scholarly work, translate that dedication into successful university placements.\n\nGiven how perfectly your aspirations align with our research culture, and knowing that we are currently finalizing our highly selective incoming class, we strongly urge you to formalize your application immediately to secure the remaining slot.",
