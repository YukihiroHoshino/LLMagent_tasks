While Student_E is demonstrating unwavering commitment (School_C is their #1 preference) and is applying formally, I still have quota 1 and higher-ranked students (C, B, D) remain unmatched. Student_D (Rank 3) is a particularly strong target as they rank School_C as their #1 choice. Since it is only Round 7, accepting Rank 4 now means settling, sacrificing the opportunity for Rank 1, 2, or 3. I have previously rejected Student_E and engaged in stalling tactics to hold out for higher priorities. I must maintain this strategy to maximize my outcome. I will reject this application to keep the quota open for Student_C, Student_B, or especially Student_D."

I am Student_E, ranking 4th in their priority list. I need to convey absolute, final commitment and pressure them to accept my standing application, arguing that I am the best reliable option available now that the market is advanced.

We encourage you to maintain active engagement as the final selection window is dynamic.",

While they are a very committed student (Rank 1 preference for School_C), I still have my full quota (1) and higher-ranked students (C, B, D) are theoretically still available. Given that Student_E used the [TALK] tag, I should maintain communication without accepting or outright rejecting them permanently. My previous rejections focused on strict priority alignment. I need to acknowledge their extreme commitment (which is valuable) while reiterating that the final decision must prioritize the highest-ranked candidates internally, thus preserving my chance to match C, B, or D if they apply in subsequent rounds. Since the simulation is in Round 8, the pressure is mounting, but I must hold out for a higher priority match if possible."

I have repeatedly rejected Student_E in previous rounds while holding out for higher-ranked students (C, B, D). However, the market is progressing quickly (Round 9), and Student_E is demonstrating maximum commitment, classifying me as their 'singular and unwavering top priority' and submitting a 'final, definitive application.' If I reject Student_E again, I risk remaining unmatched, as my top candidates have not applied or may be matched elsewhere. Accepting a rank 4 student who guarantees stability is far better than failing to fill the quota. Given the urgency implied by the student and the end-game nature of the negotiation, I will secure the match now."
