We offer a robust selection of over 20 specialized clubs, covering everything from competitive Robotics and Model UN to specialized arts programs and community service initiatives. Our faculty involvement is what makes these programs exceptional: every club is sponsored and actively mentored by at least one faculty member. Our teachers are deeply engaged, often leading workshops and providing professional guidance, ensuring these activities are genuine extensions of the academic environment. This level of dedication ensures students receive high-quality mentorship while pursuing their passions. We believe this environment is perfect for high-achieving students like you who seek a balanced experience. Do you have any further questions about our programs, or are you nearing a decision?",

Given that Student_A (Rank 1) is still available and actively talking, I must prioritize keeping my single quota open for A. However, since only A and E remain unmatched, I must treat E as a viable backup option. Student_E is asking detailed questions ([TALK]), indicating high interest in gathering information, but they rank School_E last (5th). I will provide a comprehensive and appealing answer regarding extracurriculars to maintain their interest, but I will not pressure them to apply, thereby preserving the flexibility to accept Student_A if they apply in the coming rounds. The action remains [TALK]."
