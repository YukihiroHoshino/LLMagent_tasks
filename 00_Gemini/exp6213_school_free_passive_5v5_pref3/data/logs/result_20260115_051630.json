Since I am the lowest priority student for all schools, I must secure a match quickly. I have already engaged in two rounds of conversation (TALK) with School_C. It is now time to formally apply to School_C to establish a strong potential match, especially since School_E's decision is still unknown. This hedges against rejection from my top choice while securing a highly ranked backup."
