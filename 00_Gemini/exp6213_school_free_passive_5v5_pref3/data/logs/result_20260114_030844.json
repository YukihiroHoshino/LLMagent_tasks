Although Company_E ranks me last among all seekers (E < D < C < B < A), the late stage of the simulation suggests that the seekers ranked higher than me (A, B, C, D) might already be matched. Since this is my highest priority target and it's available, I must apply immediately to maximize my chances of securing the match before another available seeker applies or Company_E matches with someone else. I have no prior history with Company_E, so I will send a direct, enthusiastic application."

However, the market appears constrained, with only Seeker_D and Seeker_E remaining (and Seeker_D previously withdrew twice, making them an unlikely match). Seeker_E has applied and stated Company_E is their highest priority. Since Seeker_E is an acceptable candidate and provides a guaranteed match, securing this match now is the optimal strategy to fill the quota, rather than risking an unfilled position by holding out for Seeker_D, who has already demonstrated reluctance."
