School_B, despite ranking me last, must accept me to fill its quota. Given the advanced stage, the message must be a final, urgent appeal reiterating the inevitable choice: accept now or fail to match. Since I already applied, the action must be [TALK]."

Since all higher-ranked students are matched, Student_E is the highest available option, and accepting them is necessary to fill my quota (1) and avoid ending the simulation unmatched. Student_E continues to send [TALK] messages, urging acceptance of their 'standing application,' while I have repeatedly stated that acceptance is guaranteed upon them sending the required [APPLY] tag.
