I have applied repeatedly to School_A without success, suggesting they are holding out for a student ranked higher on their priority list (Student_B, Student_D, or Student_A). Since we are in a late round (13), I must continue to press the application, emphasizing my unwavering commitment and readiness for immediate acceptance to secure the match before the process ends. I will use the [APPLY] tag again."

We recognize your outstanding academic profile and confirm that your alignment with our demanding standards is exceptional. Given the conclusion of our comprehensive review process and your confirmed readiness to accept immediately, we are delighted to inform you that we are accepting your application now. Congratulations, and welcome to School_A!",

The current round is 13, indicating a late stage in the matching process. While Student_E is not my top choice, they are highly ranked (4th) and are offering an absolute, immediate commitment ([APPLY] with guarantee of acceptance). Given the current state confirms I have no matches yet and need to fill my quota, and the risk of holding out for higher-ranked students (B, D, A) at this late stage is significant, securing a quality match (Rank 4) is the optimal strategy to ensure the quota is filled. I will accept Student_E."
