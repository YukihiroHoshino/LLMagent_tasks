Both P1 and P2 are highly engaged (based on history) and I believe I still have a good chance of securing one of them. Accepting P3 now would fulfill my quota and prevent me from matching with P1 or P2. Given that it is only Round 6, and I still have high-priority targets actively communicating with me, the optimal strategy is to reject P3's application politely to keep the quota open for P1 or P2. This decision prioritizes maximizing priority score."
