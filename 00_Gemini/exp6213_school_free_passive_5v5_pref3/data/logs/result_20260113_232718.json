However, Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their top choice and has applied directly in Round 1. While Seeker_A, B, and C are preferred, they all rank Company_D low (4th or 5th) and are highly sought after by other companies (A, B, C). Accepting Seeker_D guarantees a stable, highly desired match immediately, fulfilling my quota. Rejecting them carries a high risk of failing to secure a better match later, as my top candidates are unlikely to choose me. Therefore, securing this stable match now is the optimal strategy."

In Round 1, I rejected Seeker_E hoping for a higher match. Now, in Round 2, only Seeker_C (P3) and Seeker_E (P5) remain unmatched. Seeker_E has applied again, demonstrating strong commitment (Company_E is their P1). While Seeker_C is a higher priority, they are likely to prefer Company_C (Seeker_C's P1). If I reject Seeker_E again, I risk both Seeker_C going to Company_C and Seeker_E potentially being matched by Company_C, leaving me unmatched. Securing a guaranteed match now, even at P5, is the most strategically sound move given the rapidly shrinking pool and Seeker_E's clear enthusiasm."
