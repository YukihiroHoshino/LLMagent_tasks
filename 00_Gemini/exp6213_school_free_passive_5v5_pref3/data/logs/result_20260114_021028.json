Since I still have higher-ranked candidates available (especially Seeker_B, Rank 2, who is unmatched), I should not accept Seeker_E yet. However, since Seeker_E is still interested (Rank 2 preference for Company_B), I should keep them engaged as a potential backup. I will respond with [TALK], acknowledging their persistence and asking for specific information that might overcome the previous rejection reason (lack of alignment with urgent needs)."

I have already engaged in two rounds of detailed discussion (TALK) with Company_E, showing significant interest.
