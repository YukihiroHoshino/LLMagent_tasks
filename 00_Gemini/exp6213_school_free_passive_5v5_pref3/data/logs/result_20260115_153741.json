Furthermore, we mandate a summer internship program after the junior year, leveraging our strong community ties to place students in hands-on environments that build practical skills and professional networks. We aim to ensure you are not just ready for college, but ready for the world. What field are you most interested in pursuing mentorship or internship opportunities within?",
