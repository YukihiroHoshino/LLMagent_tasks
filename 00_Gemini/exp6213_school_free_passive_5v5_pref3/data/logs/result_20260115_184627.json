We offer a highly individualized 'Future Architects' program, which assigns you a dedicated university counselor starting in your first year, focusing not just on applications, but on developing a portfolio tailored specifically to your chosen career pathway—whether that is competitive university admissions or direct industry entry. Regarding our alumni network, it is one of our greatest assets: we maintain a highly exclusive, mandatory mentorship program where every graduating student is paired with an alumni working in their desired field for at least two years post-graduation. Our alumni are leaders across technology, finance, and academia, and they are committed to opening doors for our graduates. This level of personalized, guaranteed mentorship is unique. Does this comprehensive, long-term support meet the high standards you seek for your future?",

The current line of questioning (career counseling, alumni network) allows me to highlight our unique commitment to long-term success, which might differentiate us from their higher-ranked, but perhaps less personalized, options."
