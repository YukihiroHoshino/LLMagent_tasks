Since School_E is the target for this round, I need to keep their interest without committing, as they are a safety option. Applying now is premature. I will use [TALK] again, referencing the previous conversation to show sustained interest and gather more details, reinforcing my alignment with the school's general values."

To support this, we operate a flexible Independent Study Program (ISP) managed directly by our department heads, allowing students to pursue advanced research or specialized coursework not typically offered in the standard curriculum. Crucially, every student engaging in an ISP is paired with a dedicated faculty mentor who possesses expertise in that specific niche field, ensuring highly personalized guidance and access to specialized lab equipment or external academic resources through university partnerships. We are committed to fostering deep expertise in all areas of interest. Does this structure for specialized academic growth meet your expectations?",

Therefore, I should accept Student_A immediately."
