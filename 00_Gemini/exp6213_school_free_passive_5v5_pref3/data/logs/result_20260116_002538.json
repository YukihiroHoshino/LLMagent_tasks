While not my top choice, it is a highly viable option as I am ranked 3rd on their priority list (P3), and their top preferred students (A and C) rank School_E lowest (P5). This suggests School_E might be receptive. However, since my top choices (especially School_A, where I am P1) are likely still available, I should not commit to P4 yet. I will use the [TALK] tag to maintain a strong presence, reiterate my high interest, and gently probe their application timeline without formalizing an application, saving my application slot for a higher preference school if possible."

Student_B is signaling strong intent to apply soon, using the [TALK] tag to inquire about the application window/deadline.
