We foster collaboration and a unified environment in several ways:\n\n1. **Faculty-Student Mentorship:** Beyond academic advising, we operate a 'Faculty House System.' Every student is assigned to a small house mentored by two faculty members throughout their four years. This creates a consistent, informal network for guidance and social interaction outside the classroom.\n\n2. **Peer Collaboration:** We heavily promote student-led initiatives, including mandatory peer-review sessions in major courses and a robust peer tutoring program, where older students mentor younger ones, solidifying a culture of shared success rather than cutthroat competition.\n\n3. **Community Events:** We host monthly 'All-School Forums' where students and faculty discuss current events or institutional strategy, ensuring everyone has a voice. Additionally, numerous non-academic community service projects are jointly organized by students and faculty, forging bonds based on shared purpose. This holistic approach ensures a supportive and unified environment for everyone.",
