Regarding academic support for incoming students, we deploy a multi-tiered system: first, all classes are capped at 18 students to ensure personalized attention; second, we offer mandatory peer tutoring sessions twice weekly for core subjects; and finally, our specialized 'Transition Mentor Program' pairs every new student with a successful senior to help them navigate the curriculum and school life during their critical first year.

This involves applying scientific methodology, ethical reasoning, and creative communication skills simultaneously.

Matching with Student_E guarantees filling my quota, whereas failing to match now guarantees failing to fill the quota entirely, which is the worst outcome. I have repeatedly told Student_E that I am ready to accept, but they must use the [APPLY] tag to finalize the enrollment procedure. Since Student_E used [TALK] again, I must respond with [TALK] and make one final, extremely urgent appeal for them to use the required [APPLY] tag in the next, final round (Round 30). I must confirm my readiness to ACCEPT the moment they apply."
