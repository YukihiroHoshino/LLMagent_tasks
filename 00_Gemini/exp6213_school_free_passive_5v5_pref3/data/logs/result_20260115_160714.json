Since my higher preferences (D, A, B) are still available, I should avoid locking myself into my 4th choice prematurely. I have already engaged in a 'TALK' round with School_C, expressing high interest. My strategy is to maintain this highly favorable relationship without formally applying yet, keeping School_C as a strong guaranteed safety net while I try to court higher-ranked schools in subsequent rounds. I will send another [TALK] message reinforcing my fit in humanities, building on our previous conversation."

Regarding independent research and mentorship, this is where our humanities track truly excels for top students. We run the 'Scholars Initiative Program' (SIP), which is specifically designed for highly motivated students like yourself. Through SIP, you are paired with a dedicated faculty mentor in your specific field of interest (e.g., a History professor specializing in European studies or a Literature instructor focusing on contemporary poetry). This mentorship is not supervisory; it is collaborative. You receive personalized guidance to design and execute a year-long independent research project, culminating in a publication-quality paper or presentation. Furthermore, SIP students gain exclusive access to university library consortium resources and travel grants for primary source research. This level of personalized, rigorous academic support is unique and ensures our top humanities students are perfectly prepared for competitive university admissions. We are currently finalizing the cohort for this intake, and given your demonstrated interest and academic focus, we encourage you to take the next step.",
