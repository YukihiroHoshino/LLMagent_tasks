Student_A and Student_D are assumed matched/unavailable as they are not in the unmatched list. The remaining candidates are Student_C (Rank 2), Student_B (Rank 3), and Student_E (Rank 4). Student_B is applying now. Although Student_C is ranked higher, both Student_C and Student_E rank School_E last (5/5) in their preferences, making it highly unlikely they will apply in future rounds. Student_B is applying now (Rank 3), which is a high-quality match given the market constraints. Rejecting Student_B to wait for the highly improbable application from Student_C risks ending up unmatched. Therefore, I must secure the match with Student_B."

For students targeting specialized fields—such as pre-med, advanced engineering, or competitive arts portfolios—we assign an industry-specific alumni advisor in addition to their faculty mentor.

Regarding your questions: The transition into specialized elective tracks is managed proactively through our Personalized Academic Path (PAP) counseling, which begins midway through the freshman year. Students finalize their specialized elective pathway (e.g., Advanced Placement cohort, Engineering focus, Fine Arts Portfolio track) by the start of their sophomore year, allowing them three full years of targeted study and resource access. Concerning peer support, it is deeply integrated into our structure. Beyond the standard Student Council and peer mentoring, we establish specialized Peer Learning Communities (PLCs) within each elective track. These PLCs meet weekly, guided by a senior student or alumni volunteer, to facilitate collaborative problem-solving, project feedback, and exam preparation. This ensures that students pursuing similar specialized goals have a robust, high-performing support network built right into their academic schedule. Do these programs align with the kind of academic environment you seek?",
