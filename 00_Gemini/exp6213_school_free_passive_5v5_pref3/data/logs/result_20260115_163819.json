This final question regarding interdisciplinary and self-directed projects is central to our identity, and I am happy to provide a concluding perspective.\n\nSchool_E does not just tolerate interdisciplinary study; we mandate it and resource it heavily. Our core differentiator is the 'Innovator’s Lab and Research Capstone Program.' This is the specific mechanism for self-directed projects. Every student interested in deep research is assigned a dedicated faculty mentor from *outside* their primary subject area (e.g., a History teacher mentoring a student using computational models for policy research). This ensures true interdisciplinary thinking.\n\nFurthermore, our recent investment in the AI-integrated computing cluster and specialized fabrication facilities was specifically made to empower these unique, self-directed projects, giving students access to professional-grade tools for advanced data analysis, robotics, and complex simulations. This environment guarantees that your unique intellectual curiosity will not only be accommodated but actively accelerated, resulting in portfolio pieces that stand out nationally.\n\nWe have genuinely enjoyed these insightful discussions and believe your profile is an excellent fit for the rigor and innovation we champion. What is the single most critical factor you are weighing as you move toward your final decision?",

Student_E has engaged in very deep discussions (five previous rounds) and is now asking a final, critical question about interdisciplinary support, which suggests they are nearing a decision. My strategy is to provide an exceptionally strong, detailed answer to keep them highly interested (since they are a high-quality student, despite their low preference for me) while preserving the option to match with Student_B if they apply first. Since the action is [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."
