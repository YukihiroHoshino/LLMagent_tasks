We recognize that your commitment and potential perfectly match the standards we uphold.

We have a remaining quota of 1. We have previously rejected lower-ranked students (A and B) to hold out for higher priority matches. Student_E has formally applied ([APPLY]). Although Student_E ranks School_D low (4th), securing a Rank 2 match is an excellent outcome, especially since the highest priority student (Student_D) has not yet engaged or is likely matched elsewhere. Accepting Student_E now maximizes School_D's utility and fulfills the quota with a highly desired candidate."

School_B is ranked 4th. The only other currently available school is School_D (Rank 3). However, School_D ranks me last (5th priority), and I have already applied there without a confirmed match (implying a likely rejection or hold). School_B, conversely, ranks me 2nd overall, making it a highly reliable option. Given the uncertainty with School_D and the risk of remaining unmatched if I wait too long, securing the high-probability match with School_B is the most rational strategic move at this stage, even though it is my 4th choice. I will apply now."
