School_E ranks me 4th, meaning they are unlikely to accept me unless their higher priorities (A, C, B) reject them.

Furthermore, every faculty member holds mandatory open office hours daily. This personalized, readily available support ensures no student falls behind and allows for advanced students to pursue specialized challenges.
