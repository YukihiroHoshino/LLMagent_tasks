While I prefer higher-ranked candidates, securing a match now is crucial to meet my quota. The negotiation has stalled for 29 rounds because Seeker_E refuses to use the [APPLY] tag, insisting their initial application is sufficient, while I insist on the required procedural tag to finalize the agreement. Since Seeker_E used [TALK], I am procedurally obligated to respond with [TALK]. I must use this final opportunity to make an extremely urgent appeal, confirming that the match is guaranteed immediately upon their adherence to the final procedural step, or both agents will fail to match."
