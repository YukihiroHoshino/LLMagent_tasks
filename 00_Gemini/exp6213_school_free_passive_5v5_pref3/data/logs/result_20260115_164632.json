All higher-ranked students (C, B, D) must have matched elsewhere. The risk of waiting is zero, but the risk of not matching Student_E is ending the process with zero matches. Student_E has repeatedly used [TALK] instead of the required [APPLY] tag, despite my guarantees of acceptance. Given the extreme lateness of the round (28/30), I must maintain the established procedural demand to conclude the match immediately upon their application. I will reiterate that acceptance is guaranteed, but the procedural [APPLY] tag is non-negotiable for finalization."
