Crucially, School_A ranks me as their top priority ('Student_B', 'Student_D', 'Student_A', ...). Given that I have only talked to School_A previously and have not secured my top choices (School_B is still available but has rejected my prior attempts, and School_D is likely matched), securing a guaranteed match at my 3rd preference is the optimal strategy now. I will formally apply to School_A to leverage my top priority status and secure the match."
