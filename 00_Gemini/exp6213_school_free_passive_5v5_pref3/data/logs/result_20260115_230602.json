I am highly impressed by your dedication to student development. I am now in the final stages of reviewing all my options and preparing to make my formal application decisions. Could you confirm if there are any outstanding steps or specific documents you require from me in the immediate future to ensure my application process goes smoothly when I submit it?",

Since School_C (Rank 1) is still available, I should not commit to School_E yet by using [APPLY]. However, I must keep School_E engaged, as they are a viable safety option, and I am ranked 4th by them. I will use this round to strongly signal my interest and readiness to apply, effectively putting School_E on notice that I am making my final decision, without actually applying yet, thus preserving the [APPLY] action for a higher ranked school if negotiations are progressing there."

There are no immediate outstanding steps required from you right now, other than finalizing these materials. We are excited to review your submission when you feel ready to formally apply, keeping in mind the final deadline we mentioned previously. Please let us know if you have any specific questions while compiling your portfolio!",

Student_E is signaling readiness to apply soon, but is currently using the [TALK] tag. I should provide the requested clarity regarding the application requirements (as previously discussed) in a supportive manner, encouraging them to apply when they are fully ready, without applying undue pressure or making a premature commitment.

This leaves Student_E (Rank 4) and Student_A (Rank 5) as my remaining options.\nStudent_A (Rank 5) is applying now. If I accept, I secure my lowest priority match and lose the chance to match with Student_E (Rank 4).\nTherefore, I must reject Student_A to hold my quota open for Student_E, who is ranked higher.

Committing to School_E now (Rank 5) would prevent me from potentially matching with School_C (Rank 2), however unlikely that scenario is. Since E ranks me first, they are unlikely to match with anyone else this round unless I clearly withdraw."

These advisors meet weekly with their mentees.\n\nSecond, we implement the 'Peer Leadership Corps' program. Incoming students are matched with high-performing 11th and 12th graders who have demonstrated strong leadership qualities.
