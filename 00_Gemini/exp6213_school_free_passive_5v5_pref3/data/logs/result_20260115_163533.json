This implies my top three priorities (C, B, D) are already matched elsewhere. Student_E is my 4th priority (P4) and is the highest-ranked student currently available. Student_E has also indicated that School_C is their top choice (P1), making this a highly desirable and stable match. Since I have quota remaining, and Student_E is the best available option, I should accept the application."

I will use [TALK] to maintain a positive relationship and keep the option open for a later application if necessary, thus prioritizing the objective of matching with a school as high as possible on my list.

We track our alumni success rigorously, and the interdisciplinary foundation is precisely what sets them apart in competitive environments. Our graduates consistently report that the ability to synthesize knowledge across fields—for example, combining data science with global policy or engineering with ethics—gives them a significant advantage.\n\nSpecifically, 85% of our recent graduating classes have pursued majors that require strong cross-disciplinary thinking. We've seen alumni gain early acceptance into top programs for fields like Computational Biology, Sustainable Urban Planning, and Digital Humanities, areas that simply didn't exist as standalone majors a decade ago. One notable example is a recent graduate who leveraged their Capstone Project (integrating AI and environmental science) to secure a paid research fellowship during their first year of university, something highly uncommon for freshmen. Our graduates are not just specialists; they are adaptable problem-solvers. Does the prospect of being prepared for these rapidly evolving fields strongly influence your decision-making process?",

They are currently asking about graduate outcomes tied to our interdisciplinary focus. I must provide a compelling, data-backed response to solidify their interest and encourage an application. Since they used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK] and continue actively appealing."

Given that I have already applied to School_C (my 2nd choice) and the current situation suggests School_E might be the only remaining option (or at least the only one available to me this round), securing this guaranteed match is the best strategy to maximize my utility and avoid being unmatched.
