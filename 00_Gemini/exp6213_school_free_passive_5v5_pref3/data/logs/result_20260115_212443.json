For transition, every incoming student is paired with a dedicated faculty mentor who provides one-on-one guidance throughout their four years, focusing on academic planning and socio-emotional adaptation. To manage academic stress, we have established a comprehensive wellness center staffed by licensed counselors offering both individual and group sessions, focusing on mindfulness and time management techniques. We also integrate 'wellness days' into our academic calendar to ensure students have structured breaks. What specific aspects of high school transition are you most concerned about?",
              "thought": "Student_E is ranked 4th on my priority list (P4). While not a top choice, they are acceptable, and I currently have an unfilled quota (1). However, higher priority students (Student_A and Student_C) are still available and unmatched. Student_E initiated a [TALK] action, focusing on student welfare and support services. Since high-priority students are still on the market, I should not rush into an agreement with P4. I need to keep the conversation positive and engaging (as Student_E also ranks School_E last in their preference list), but my primary goal remains P1 or P2. I will answer the question thoroughly and maintain the [TALK] status."

              "thought": "School_D is my absolute highest preference (Rank 1). I have not interacted with them yet. School_D ranks me third (Student_D, Student_E, Student_C...). Given that School_D has capacity for only one student, and I am ranked 3rd, I must apply immediately to establish a tentative match and prevent them from accepting Student_D or Student_E if they apply later, or if they decide to accept me now due to lack of application from higher-ranked students. Pursuing my top choice aggressively is the optimal strategy."

Student_C has applied and stated that School_D is their top preference. This is a very strong and stable match. Although Student_E (2nd priority) is still available, Student_E ranks School_D 4th, making a guaranteed match with the highly enthusiastic 3rd priority candidate (Student_C) strategically sound, especially early in the simulation. I will accept Student_C to secure the high-quality match and fill the quota."

The current situation suggests that School_E is the only high school remaining unmatched in the market. If this is true, I must secure this match, as it is preferable to being unmatched. I have previously used the [TALK] tag with School_E. Since it is the only viable option remaining, I will now formally apply. School_E ranks me 4th, so applying now is crucial before any higher-priority student might dislodge their current match and apply here."
