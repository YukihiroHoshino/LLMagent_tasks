Based on our extensive conversations and your demonstrated potential, we are delighted to offer you admission. We look forward to welcoming you into our community and supporting your journey to becoming a future leader.",

Since my quota is 1 and I currently have no matches, securing a high-priority student who has formally applied ([APPLY]) is an excellent outcome. Although Student_A is my top choice, rejecting Rank 2 on the long shot that Rank 1 (who also ranks me last) will apply is strategically unsound. I will accept Student_C."
