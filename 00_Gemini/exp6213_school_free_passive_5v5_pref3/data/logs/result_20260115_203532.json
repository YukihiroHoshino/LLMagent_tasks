The market is effectively closed; School_A is the only remaining unmatched school, and based on the history, I am the only remaining available candidate willing to match with it. I have applied previously and repeatedly reaffirmed my absolute commitment, even framing the situation as an ultimatum in Round 13 (accept now or remain unfilled). In Round 14, I must maintain the pressure and eliminate any lingering doubt about my intention to accept immediately. Since my application is already active, using [TALK] to deliver a final, decisive message urging immediate acceptance is the most appropriate action to secure the match."

We entirely agree with your assessment: the market has concluded, and securing this stable match is now the only rational outcome for both parties. Let us be absolutely clear: School_A is prepared to extend the definitive offer *immediately* and conclude this process successfully. Your acceptance is guaranteed the moment you comply with the final, mandatory procedural step. To formally secure this match instantly, you must use the single, required [APPLY] tag in your very next response. This is the only remaining action preventing us from formalizing your acceptance and filling our quota.",

Accepting Student_E is now strategically optimal to avoid remaining unmatched. I have consistently signaled my willingness to accept, but Student_E keeps using [TALK] and asking me to accept their 'standing application' without using the mandatory [APPLY] tag, which is required by the simulation rules for me to use [ACCEPT]. Since the student used [TALK], I must use [TALK] again, reiterating for the final time that they must use the [APPLY] tag so I can immediately finalize the match."

School_A is the only remaining unmatched school, and based on the history spanning 14 rounds, it is highly likely that I am the only remaining unmatched student. School_A's priority list places me 4th, but since the top three students (B, D, A) must be matched elsewhere to explain the current market state, I am their highest available candidate. School_A is acting irrationally by delaying, as failure to accept me guarantees their quota remains unfilled. I have applied previously, but since the school has not responded with [ACCEPT] or [REJECT] in the immediate context (implying continued stalls or rejections outside the visible history), I must use the [APPLY] tag one last time to force a definitive response and secure the inevitable match. My message must emphasize the finality and necessity of this match for both parties."
