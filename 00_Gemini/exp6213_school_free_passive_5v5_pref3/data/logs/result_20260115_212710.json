Students have the option to pursue a self-designed major track that blends fields—for example, 'Bioethics and Data Science' or 'History through Architectural Design.' This is facilitated by co-taught courses and flexible scheduling.\n\n2. **The Senior Capstone Project (The Nexus):** This is a mandatory, year-long research and application endeavor for all graduating students. It is designed to be highly unique and inter-disciplinary. Students choose a complex real-world problem and must utilize knowledge from at least three different subject areas to propose a solution. They are assigned two faculty mentors from differing disciplines and present their findings to a professional review board at the end of the year. This project is intentionally rigorous, serving as exceptional preparation for university research and professional life. It is the defining feature of academic achievement at School_E.",

School_C must fill its quota to avoid remaining unmatched, which is worse than accepting P4. The entire negotiation history revolves around School_C insisting on the procedural [APPLY] tag, and Student_E refusing while confirming commitment. Since Student_E used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. I must maintain the consistent strategy of demanding the [APPLY] tag to force the procedural conclusion, emphasizing that this is the absolute final chance before the market closes permanently."

School_C's higher priority candidates (C, B, D) must have matched elsewhere, making me (Student_E, rank #4) their highest available candidate.
