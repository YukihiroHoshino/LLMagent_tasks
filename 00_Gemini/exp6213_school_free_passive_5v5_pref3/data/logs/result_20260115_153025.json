While Student_D (Rank 1) and Student_E (Rank 2) are still available, both rank School_D very low (5th and 4th, respectively). Waiting for D or E is highly risky, as they are likely to be matched by their higher-preferred schools (C, A, B) before being forced down to School_D. Furthermore, if I reject Student_C, C will likely match immediately with School_C (C's #4 preference, but C's #1 priority). Given the high risk of ending up unmatched or matching with a much lower priority student if I wait, securing Student_C (Rank 3) now is the optimal move to maximize the expected priority rank match within my single quota."
