When quotas are 1, the DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (students). This means that submitting the true preference list is a dominant strategy, guaranteeing the best possible stable outcome for the student.

Simulating the DA process with true preferences reveals:
1. Student_A's top choice, School_E, strongly prefers Student_B over Student_A (S_B is 2nd, S_A is 3rd on E's priority list). Thus, S_A cannot stably match with School_E.
2. In the resulting student-optimal stable matching, Student_A is matched with School_B (S_A's 2nd choice).

Part 2 of the procedure checks for 'blocking students' who held a temporary spot but ultimately moved. Since the DA process only allows students to move to strictly better schools, and the process ends when no student is rejected, temporary admissions equal final admissions in the natural termination of DA. Therefore, Part 2 will not alter the stable matching found in Part 1, and misrepresenting preferences would only risk achieving a worse match.

   - Student A's top choice is School E. School E's priority list ranks Student B (R2) higher than Student A (R3).

   - Round 1: Students A, B, D apply to School E. School E prefers B (2nd priority) over A (3rd) and D (4th). B is admitted to E. C is admitted to D. E is admitted to C. A and D are rejected.
   - Round 2: A applies to B (admitted). D applies to A (admitted).
   - Final Match (M): B is matched with School E.

2. Since B matched with School E in Round 1 and did not move, B is not a 'blocking student' at E (a blocking student must have been temporarily admitted but moved to a different final match).

1. Analysis of Truthful Reporting (Part 1):
If all students submit their true preferences, in Round 1, School E receives proposals from A, B, and D. School E prefers B (rank 2) over A (rank 3). E admits B, rejecting A and D. Student A is rejected by their 1st choice (E).
In Round 2, Student A proposes to School B (A's 2nd choice). School B prefers A (rank 1) and admits A.
The resulting stable match is A -> B.

2. Outcome Evaluation:
School B is A's 2nd preferred school ('School_E', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C'). Since A cannot displace B at E (due to E's priorities), B is the highest ranked school A can achieve in a stable match.

3. Part 2 Analysis:
In the stable match resulting from truthful reporting, no student who was temporarily admitted ever moved to a different school, thus there are no blocking students. Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

The DAA is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (the students). This means that a student cannot achieve a better outcome by submitting a preference list that deviates from their true preferences, regardless of what other students submit.

First, I determine the outcome if all students submit their true preferences (M1):
1. R1: S_A, S_B, S_D propose E. E prefers S_B > S_A > S_D. E admits S_B. S_C proposes D (admitted). S_E proposes C (admitted).
2. R2: S_A (rejected by E) proposes B. B admits S_A. S_D (rejected by E) proposes A. A admits S_D.
3. Final Matching M1: S_B is matched to School E (Rank 1).

Since Student B achieves their Rank 1 school (School E) in the stable matching M1, this is the optimal possible outcome. 

I must also consider Part 2 (Blocking Students). A student S is blocking at H if S was temporarily admitted at H (causing rejections) but S's final admission differs from H. In the M1 run, every student who received a temporary admission retained it until the end (e.g., S_B was admitted by E in R1 and remained matched to E). Therefore, no blocking students are generated, and Part 2 does not trigger a re-run.

1. Initial Run (Assuming truthful submission): If Student D submits the true preference list ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'], the SDA proceeds:

2. Stability Check: Since D cannot displace B at School E (D's Rank 1 choice) due to E's priorities, School A (Rank 2) is the best possible stable outcome for Student D.

3.

1. R1: A, B, D apply to E; C applies to D; E applies to C. E admits B (A, D rejected). D admits C. C admits E. 
2. R2: A applies to B; D applies to A. B admits A. A admits D. 
3. M1 Result: (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C).

1. Analyzing my top choice, School E: Student A is the 3rd priority at School E (behind Student E and Student B). Since Student B also ranks School E first and has higher priority than A, School E is unattainable for Student A, assuming B proposes E truthfully (which is rational for B).

2. Analyzing my second choice, School B: Student A is the 1st priority at School B. Since A is the highest priority applicant, A can secure B immediately if A lists B first.

3. Strategic Choice: If A lists E first, A will be rejected in Step 1, and then successfully apply to B in Step 2. If A lists B first, A secures B in Step 1 immediately. In the BM, securing a high-priority school early minimizes the risk of that school being filled by other students who might otherwise be rejected later and displace A from a lower choice. Since B is the best achievable school, listing it first guarantees the optimal outcome (School B, 2nd true choice) with maximum safety.

4. The chosen list ['School_B', 'School_E', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C'] guarantees a match with School B, and since this outcome is equivalent to the stable DA outcome, no 'blocking students' will be found in Part 2, finalizing the match with School B.",False,School_B,True,True,2

First, I simulated the DA process using all students' true preferences. Student D's true list is ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'].
In Round 1, D applies to School E, along with Students A and B. School E prefers B (P2) > A (P3) > D (P4). School E tentatively matches B, rejecting A and D.
In Round 2, D applies to School A (Rank 2). School A accepts D (P2).
This leads to the stable match M(D) = School A (Rank 2).

Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof, D cannot manipulate their submitted list to achieve a better outcome (i.e., School E).

Since no blocking students are found, the M1 matches are final.

Decisions: E admits B (rejects A, D); D admits C; C admits E.

3. Optimal Outcome: When all students submit their true preferences, the Part 1 process yields the S-OSM: M(S_A) = School_B (2nd choice), M(S_B) = School_E, M(S_C) = School_D, M(S_D) = School_A, M(S_E) = School_C. This outcome matches Student_A to their 2nd choice.

4. Part 2 Review: Since this S-OSM is achieved without any student moving away from a school where they caused a rejection, Part 2 does not trigger any list modifications. The final match remains School_B.

5.

1. Initial DA Analysis (Truth-telling):
   If Student D submits their true preferences ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'], the DA process yields the stable matching M_DA.
   In Round 1, D proposes to School E (Rank 1). School E receives applications from A, B, D. E prioritizes B (R2) > A (R3) > D (R4). E accepts B and rejects D. 
   D then proposes to School A (Rank 2) in Round 2, and School A accepts D. 
   The S-OSM result for Student D is School A (Rank 2).

2. Blocking Student Check (Part 2):
   The 'Blocking Student' rule only triggers if a student (S) was temporarily admitted at a school (H), caused rejections, but later moved away (M(S) != H). Since the DA process, when run to completion, results in a stable matching M_DA where no temporary match was ever broken by a student moving to a preferred school, no blocking students are found in this specific trace. Therefore, Part 2 does not alter the outcome M_DA.

3. Strategic Consideration:
   Since D is rejected by their R1 choice (School E) due to School E prioritizing Student B, D cannot achieve E regardless of D's submitted list order, as long as B also applies to E. Lying (e.g., hiding School A) would result in a worse outcome (potentially being unmatched).

1. Determining the SOSM (assuming truth-telling):

2. SA applies to School B (2nd choice) in Round 2 and is accepted, as School B ranks SA highest among all applicants. The resulting match M1 is (SA, School B).
3. Since M1 is a stable matching where all quotas are 1, there are no 'blocking students' (Part 2 conditions are not met). M1 is the final outcome.
4. Since School E is unattainable, School B (SA's 2nd choice) is the best possible outcome. Therefore, submitting the true preference list is the dominant strategy to secure this match.",True,School_B,True,True,2

Round 1: Students A, B, D propose to E. E prefers B (Rank 2), rejects A (Rank 3) and D (Rank 4). C proposes to D (accepted). E proposes to C (accepted). D and A are rejected.
Round 2: D proposes to A (accepted). A proposes to B (accepted).

The resulting stable match (M1) is: A-B, B-E, C-D, D-A, E-C. Student D receives School A, which is Rank 2 on the true preference list.

The rules state that the refinement process in Part 2 'will never change your final admission.' This confirms that the match achieved through the DAA based on my submitted list is robust. Since submitting truthfully yields the best stable outcome for me (Rank 2, School A), and strategic misrepresentation cannot guarantee a strictly better outcome (Rank 1, School E, as E prefers B over D), the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,School_A,True,True,2

1. Run Part 1 (DA) using the true preferences for all students:
    *   Round 1: School E accepts Student B (Priority 2), rejecting A (P3) and D (P4). School A is rejected by E and applies to B. Student D is rejected by E and applies to A.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Students):
    *   A blocking student occurs if a student S was temporarily admitted at H, caused rejections, but S ultimately moved elsewhere. In the stable matching generated in Part 1, no student who was provisionally accepted later moved (e.g., B was accepted by E in R1 and stayed matched with E).

I first calculated the outcome of the standard DA using all students' true preferences:
1. Round 1: Students A, B, D apply to E. Student B is admitted (highest priority at E). A and D are rejected. E applies to C (admitted). C applies to D (admitted).

Student D's match is School A, which is the 2nd choice on the True Preference List ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C']. Student D cannot achieve School E because students B and A have higher priority at E (B is 2nd, A is 3rd, D is 4th), and both B and A apply to E first and are admitted/rejected by E in a way that blocks D.

1. Initial DAA (Part 1) Analysis: If Student_A submits the true preference list ['School_E', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C'], the resulting stable match is School_B (A's 2nd choice).

   - If D attempts to manipulate (e.g., submitting [A, E, B, D, C]), D secures A in R1, never applies to E, and still achieves School A.

1. Part 1 (Standard DA): Calculating the outcome reveals that if all students submit their true preferences, Student C is matched with School D (Rank 1).
   - R1: S_C applies to D and is temporarily accepted. S_A, S_B, S_D apply to E; E accepts S_B. S_E applies to C and is accepted. (S_A, S_D rejected).

   - Final Match M1: (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C). This is a stable matching.

2. Part 2 (Blocking Student Check): Since no student was temporarily admitted and subsequently moved to a different school (i.e., every temporary admission in Part 1 became the final admission for that school), there are no 'blocking students' as defined. The procedure terminates with M1.

My goal is to maximize the rank of the matched school according to my true preferences: ['School_E', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_A', 'School_C'].

1. Simulate Part 1 (DAA) using true preferences:
   - Round 1: S_A, S_B, S_D propose to H_E. H_E prefers S_B (2nd priority) over S_A (3rd) and S_D (4th). H_E holds S_B. S_A and S_D are rejected.
   - Round 2: S_A proposes to H_B (2nd choice). H_B holds S_A (1st priority). S_D proposes to H_A. H_A holds S_D (2nd priority).
   - Final Matching (M): (S_A, H_B), (S_B, H_E), (S_C, H_D), (S_D, H_A), (S_E, H_C).

2. Student_A's outcome is H_B, which is the 2nd choice. This is the Student-Optimal Stable Matching (S-OSM).

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Students Check): Part 2 only triggers if a student was temporarily admitted, caused a rejection, but then moved to a different final match. Since the outcome M is stable, and the DAA runs until no further rejections occur, the temporary matches that caused rejections (like S_B at H_E) are also the final matches. Therefore, no blocking students are found, and the matching M is final.

4. Since reporting truthfully yields the S-OSM, and strategic misreporting in DAA generally does not improve the proposing student's outcome relative to their true preferences, the optimal strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,School_B,True,True,2

The matching process described is the Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1), followed by a check for 'blocking students' (Part 2).

1. Analyze Part 1 (DA) using true preferences:
   - S_B's first choice is School_E.
   - In Round 1, S_B proposes to School_E, along with S_A and S_D.
   - School_E's priority list ranks S_B highest among the proposers (E: E > B > A > D > C).
   - School_E tentatively admits S_B and rejects S_A and S_D.
   - Since S_B is accepted by their Rank 1 choice (E) and is never subsequently rejected in Part 1, the final match for S_B remains School_E.

2. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Student Check):
   - A student is a blocking student if they were temporarily admitted at H (causing rejections) AND their final admission differs from H (Discrepancy).
   - S_B was temporarily admitted at E in R1 (causing rejections of S_A and S_D).
   - S_B's final admission is also E (No Discrepancy).
   - Therefore, S_B is not a blocking student, and the procedure terminates with the matching M where S_B is matched to E.

If Student A submits the true preferences (E, B, D, A, C), the resulting stable matching (M_DA) is (A, B). Since School E is unattainable due to Student B having higher priority and preferring E, School B (Rank 2) is the highest attainable school for Student A.",True,School_B,True,True,2

I simulated the process using everyone's true preferences (Part 1):
Round 1: Students A, B, D propose to E. E admits B (highest priority), rejects A, D. C proposes to D (admitted). E proposes to C (admitted). Matches: (B, E), (C, D), (E, C).
Round 2: A proposes to B (admitted). D proposes to A (admitted). Final stable matching M: (A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C).

Student B is matched with School E, which is B's 1st choice.

Since the resulting match M is stable, and Student B's final match (E) was also their first temporary admission at E, no 'blocking students' are generated (Part 2 conditions are not met). The process terminates immediately with the stable matching.

Therefore, submitting the true preference list maximizes Student B's outcome, securing the 1st choice.",True,School_E,True,True,1

1. Execution of Part 1 (using true preferences for all students):
   - Round 1 results in C being temporarily admitted to School D.
   - The final stable matching M is: {(A, B), (B, E), (C, D), (D, A), (E, C)}.
2. In this matching M, Student C is matched with School D, which is C's Rank 1 choice ('School_D').
3. Since C achieves the highest possible outcome, no manipulation of the choice ranking list can result in a better match.
4. Furthermore, tracing the temporary admissions confirms that no student becomes a 'blocking student' (i.e., no student was temporarily admitted and later moved to a different school/unmatched state). Thus, Part 2 does not modify the outcome.

1. Round 1 Applications:
