Seeker_B has submitted a formal application ([APPLY]) in Round 1.\n\nWhile Seeker_A is my top priority, Seeker_A ranks Company_B first and likely applied there. Since Company_B also prioritizes Seeker_A highly, it is unlikely Seeker_A will become available to me. \n\nSecuring my Rank #2 candidate immediately in Round 1 is an excellent outcome, especially since I only have one quota slot. Rejecting Seeker_B to wait for the highly improbable Seeker_A would be too risky, potentially leaving me with lower-ranked candidates later. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_B's application."

However, Seeker_D has applied in Round 1, indicating I am their top choice (P1). Given that the higher-ranked seekers (A, B, C) have not contacted me and generally rank Company_D low on their preference lists (P4, P5, P4 respectively), waiting for them is risky, and I might end up with no match or only Seeker_E later. Since I only have one quota, securing a definite match with a highly motivated candidate (Seeker_D) in Round 1 is strategically sound, even if they are P4 on my list. I will accept Seeker_D."

My higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) all rank Company_E very low (4th or 5th), and they are likely applying to their top choices (Companies A, B, C, D) who also prioritize them highly.

However, neither higher-ranked seeker applied in Round 2, and they both prioritize other companies (A and B) higher than me (Seeker_A ranks me #3, Seeker_B ranks me #2). Rejecting Seeker_C again carries a significant risk that they will move on to their second choice (Company_B) in Round 3, resulting in me potentially missing out on a strong, highly motivated candidate (Rank #3).
