While Seeker_D is not my top choice, my top choices (A, B, C) are unlikely to apply to Company_D in Round 1, as Company_D ranks low on their preference lists. Seeker_D, however, ranks Company_D as their P1 choice. Accepting Seeker_D secures a guaranteed match immediately, fulfilling my quota with a high-certainty candidate who strongly prefers us.
