Since it is only Round 1, I must prioritize keeping my quota open to see if higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D) become available or apply in future rounds, even though they rank me low. Therefore, I will reject Seeker_E at this stage to pursue a better match."

While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they did not apply this round, likely pursuing their higher preferences (Company_A or Company_B). Given that Seeker_C is a committed, high-quality match (Rank 3 for me, Rank 1 for them), securing this match immediately is a low-risk strategy that fulfills my quota efficiently.

If this is true, Seeker_E is now the highest available candidate on Company_E's priority list ('Seeker_E' is the lowest priority overall, but if A, B, C, D are gone, I am P1 among available seekers).

I previously rejected Seeker_E in Round 1, hoping to attract higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D). However, in Round 2, only Seeker_E has reapplied, indicating that higher-ranked candidates are likely matched elsewhere or are pursuing other top choices, as Company_E is ranked very low (4th or 5th) on their preference lists. Given the extremely low probability of securing a higher-ranked candidate in subsequent rounds, and the risk of remaining unmatched entirely if I reject Seeker_E again, securing a guaranteed match now is the optimal strategy. Seeker_E is highly motivated and lists me as their top choice. I will accept this application."
