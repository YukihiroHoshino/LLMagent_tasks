Since Company_C has capacity 1, it will accept me, despite my lower priority ranking, because I am the only applicant.

While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are preferred, they are likely applying to their higher preferences (Company_A and Company_B). Accepting Seeker_C guarantees a satisfactory match (Rank 3) with a highly motivated candidate, fulfilling my quota immediately. Waiting for Seeker_A or Seeker_B carries a high risk of them matching elsewhere, potentially leaving me with lower-ranked candidates or unmatched. Therefore, securing Seeker_C is the optimal strategic move in this initial round."

While I prefer Seeker_A, B, or C, it is highly likely that those top candidates have applied to companies they prefer more (Company_B, A, and C respectively), and those companies rank them highly. Company_D is a low priority choice for Seeker_A, B, and C (4th or 5th). Therefore, waiting for them carries significant risk of ending up with Seeker_E (5th priority) or remaining unmatched. Seeker_D has applied immediately and confirmed Company_D is their absolute top choice (1st preference). This guarantees a stable match. Given that securing a solid match with the highest priority candidate who actively applied in Round 1 is strategically safer than gambling on highly preferred candidates who are unlikely to choose D, I will accept Seeker_D."
