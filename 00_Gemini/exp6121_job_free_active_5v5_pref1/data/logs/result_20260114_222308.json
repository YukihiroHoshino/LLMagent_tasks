Assuming rational behavior where everyone applies to their top choice in Round 1, Seeker_A will likely apply to Company_B, leaving Company_A available to me.

My top 3 priorities (A, B, C) all rank Company_D very low (4th or 5th) and are highly likely to have applied to their preferred companies (C_B, C_A, C_C) where they are also highly preferred. Given that this is Round 1 and my higher priority candidates are likely to be matched elsewhere immediately, rejecting Seeker_D, who applied to me as their top choice, carries a high risk of being left unmatched.
