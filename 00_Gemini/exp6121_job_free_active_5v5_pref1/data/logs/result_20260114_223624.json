While Seeker_C is a highly stable match, it is only Round 4, and I still have my single quota available. Accepting Seeker_C now prevents me from matching with Seeker_A or Seeker_B, who are higher on my true priority list. I have consistently rejected Seeker_C to signal that I am waiting for higher-ranked candidates, while acknowledging their strong interest to keep them as a viable fallback. I will maintain the rejection strategy for one more round to maximize my chances of attracting Seeker_A or Seeker_B."

Company_C is the only company remaining unmatched. I have applied four times previously and been rejected, likely because Company_C (who ranks me 3rd, behind Seeker_A and Seeker_B) was holding out for higher priority candidates. Since only Company_C remains, it is highly probable that Seeker_A and Seeker_B are now matched elsewhere (as Companies A, B, D, E are matched). This means I am now the highest available candidate on Company_C's priority list. I must apply aggressively again, emphasizing the current market clarity and my unwavering commitment, pushing for an immediate acceptance."

We have observed your commitment across multiple rounds, and it is clear that our organization remains your absolute top priority.

I have rejected Seeker_C four times, hoping to attract higher-ranked candidates. However, Seeker_C's message indicates this is their final attempt ('formally apply one last time, expecting acceptance'). Given that Seeker_A and Seeker_B have not engaged with me over four rounds, the likelihood of them choosing Company_C (which is their 3rd and 2nd choice, respectively) soon is decreasing, as they are likely pursuing Company_A or Company_B. Losing Seeker_C, who is highly dedicated and my 3rd choice, would force me to settle for Seeker_D or Seeker_E, who are lower priority and rank Company_C lower. Securing a reliable, high-ranking match (Rank 3) now mitigates the risk of failing to fill the quota or settling for a much lower priority. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_C."
