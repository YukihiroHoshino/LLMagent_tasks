If all seekers apply to their Rank 1 company, Company_A will only receive an application from me (Seeker_B). Since I am their second preferred candidate and they have capacity, they should accept. Therefore, I will formally apply to Company_A."

Since Seeker_B ranks me as their #1 choice, and they are a high priority for me, accepting this offer secures a strong match immediately. Although Seeker_A is P1, Seeker_A did not apply this round.

Since none of the higher priority seekers are likely to apply to Company_D in Round 1 (as D is low on their lists), Company_D is likely to receive only my proposal (or proposals from E and D, who are lowest priority). Since Company_D has capacity 1 and I am available, applying immediately gives me the highest chance of acceptance, even though I am the 4th priority overall. I will use the [APPLY] action."

Based on market preferences, my top three candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_B, Seeker_C) are applying to other companies where they are ranked highly (A to B, B to A, C to C). It is highly probable that A, B, and C will be matched elsewhere in this round. Therefore, Seeker_D is likely the highest available candidate for Company_D.

Seeker_C, who ranks me as their top choice (R1), has applied in Round 1. Although Seeker_C is my third preference, securing a match with a high-quality, highly motivated candidate early in the process is a strong outcome, especially since my top two preferences (Seeker_A and Seeker_B) did not apply this round.
