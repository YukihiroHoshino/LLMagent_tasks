My preference list is ['Company_C' (#1), 'Company_B' (#2), 'Company_A' (#3), 'Company_D' (#4), 'Company_E' (#5)].\nOnly Company_C and Company_D remain available.\nCompany_C is my top priority.\n\nCompany_C's priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E'].\nSince I have been rejected three times (R1, R2, R3), Company_C was likely holding out for Seeker_A or Seeker_B, both of whom rank higher than me. Since three companies (A, B, E) are now matched, it is highly probable that Seeker_A and Seeker_B are no longer available.\n\nIf Seeker_A and Seeker_B are matched elsewhere, Seeker_C becomes the highest available candidate on Company_C's priority list. Given that this is Round 4 and Company_C still has capacity, they are highly motivated to match now. I must press my application to Company_C, as securing my Rank 1 choice is paramount."

I have 1 quota remaining. It is Round 4, and I have previously rejected Seeker_C (Rank 3) three times while holding out for Seeker_A or Seeker_B. Neither Seeker_A nor Seeker_B has applied to me yet. Seeker_C ranks Company_C as their absolute top choice and has shown incredible persistence. At this stage, continuing to reject a highly committed Rank 3 candidate risks losing them entirely, and there is no guarantee that R1 or R2 candidates will apply before being matched elsewhere. Securing Seeker_C now is a highly strategic and safe move to ensure a quality match. I will accept Seeker_C."
