Waiting for a higher-ranked candidate who has low preference for Company_D carries a high risk of being left unmatched or only matching with Seeker_E (Rank 5).\nSecuring a match with a highly motivated candidate (Seeker_D, Rank 4) early in the process is a prudent strategy given the market dynamics.
