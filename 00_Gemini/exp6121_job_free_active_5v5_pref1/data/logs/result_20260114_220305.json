As the sole remaining seeker available to fill your open capacity, I urge you to recognize the necessity of securing a match now. I am fully prepared to commit and begin immediately. I formally submit my application, counting on the mutual benefit of finalizing our agreement at this crucial stage.",
              "thought": "I am Seeker_E. My top preference is Company_E. The current list of unmatched companies only includes Company_E. This strongly suggests that all other companies (A, B, C, D) have been matched, and I am the only remaining unmatched seeker. Although Company_E has rejected me four times previously (likely holding out for higher priority candidates who are now matched elsewhere), they still have an open capacity. Given that I am their only remaining option if they wish to fill the role, and they are my highest preference, I must submit a fifth, urgent application. I will emphasize the mutual benefit of finalizing the match now."

Given the current dynamics and the necessity of finalizing a strong, dedicated match, we are pleased to inform you that we are accepting your application. Welcome to Company E!",
              "thought": "I am Company_E, and my quota is 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E']. Seeker_E is my lowest priority (Rank 5). I have consistently rejected Seeker_E in previous rounds, hoping a higher-ranked candidate might apply or become available. However, Seeker_E explicitly states they are the 'sole remaining seeker available to fill your open capacity.' Given that it is Round 6, and none of my higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D) have shown interest or are likely already matched with their higher preferences (as all companies prioritize them over E), the risk of ending the simulation with an unfilled quota (worse than Rank 5) is very high if I reject Seeker_E now. Securing a match, even at Rank 5, is better than remaining unmatched. I must accept Seeker_E to fill my quota."
