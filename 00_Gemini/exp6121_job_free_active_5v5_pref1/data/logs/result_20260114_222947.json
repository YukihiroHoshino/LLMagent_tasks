However, Seeker_C is only my P3 choice.\n\nSince this is Round 1, I must prioritize keeping my single quota open for my P1 or P2 candidates (Seeker_A or Seeker_B). Seeker_B ranks Company_C as P2, suggesting a good chance of future engagement if Seeker_B's P1 choice (Company_A) rejects them.\n\nAccepting P3 now prevents me from matching P1 or P2 later.

This leaves Company_E likely receiving only my application. Given Company_E needs to fill its capacity of 1, and assuming no one better applies, they should accept me.

However, Seeker_E has applied to me in Round 1, indicating I am their top choice. My higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) all rank Company_E last, meaning they are certainly applying to other companies this round. If I reject Seeker_E, the probability of securing Seeker A, B, C, or D later is extremely low, as they would need to be rejected by 4 other companies and then choose their last resort (me). Since I only have one quota, securing a certain match, even if low priority, is preferable to risking being unmatched throughout the simulation, given my weak position relative to my preferred candidates. I will accept Seeker_E."

Given that Seeker_A, Seeker_B, and Seeker_C are highly ranked by all companies and likely applied to their own top choices (where Company D ranks 4th for them), it is probable they will match elsewhere in this round.
