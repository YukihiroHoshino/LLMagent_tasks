If all seekers propose to their P1 company, Company_D will only receive one application (from me, Seeker_D). Although Company_D ranks me 4th on their priority list, if they only receive one application, they should accept it, resulting in a stable match for me at my P1 choice immediately."

Seeker_D has applied to me in Round 1, ranking Company_D as their 1st choice. While Seeker_D is not my top priority, securing a match in Round 1 is strategically important, especially since my top three candidates (A, B, C) are highly preferred by other companies (A, B, C) and rank Company_D low on their lists (4th or 5th). The likelihood of successfully attracting A, B, or C later is low. Accepting Seeker_D secures a committed candidate and fulfills my quota early, preventing me from potentially ending up unmatched or settling for Seeker_E later. I will accept this application."

Since this is Round 1 and I have no prior information suggesting I should compromise, I will aggressively pursue my top preference by sending a formal application ([APPLY]). Based on typical first-round behavior where seekers target their top choices (Seeker_A->C_B, Seeker_B->C_A, Seeker_D->C_D, Seeker_E->C_E), I am likely to be the only applicant for Company_C, despite being its 3rd preferred candidate.

Seeker_C has applied directly, indicating I am their top choice (1st preference). While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they both prefer other companies (Company_A and Company_B). It is highly likely that Seeker_A and Seeker_B have applied to their preferred companies in this round and might be matched. Securing a match with my 3rd priority, who views me as their top choice, guarantees a quality match immediately and prevents the risk of being left with lower priorities (D or E) if A and B match elsewhere. Given the quota limit of 1, securing Seeker_C is a strong strategic move in Round 1."
