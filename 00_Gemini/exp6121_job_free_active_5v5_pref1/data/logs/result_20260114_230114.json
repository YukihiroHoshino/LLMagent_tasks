In Round 1, assuming agents prioritize their absolute top choices, Seeker_A is likely to target Company_B and Seeker_B is likely to target Company_A.

While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they are also highly desired by other companies (Company_A and Company_B, which they prefer over me). Given that it is Round 1 and Seeker_C offers a stable, immediate match based on their top preference, securing this P3 match is a strong outcome, mitigating the risk of my top two priorities matching elsewhere and leaving me unmatched or forced to take a lower priority later.

Given the structure of the market, my top three candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_B, Seeker_C) likely applied to their own top preferences (Company_B, Company_A, and Company_C respectively). Since all companies prioritize A, B, C highly, it is highly probable that A, B, and C will be matched in Round 1 with other companies. If I reject Seeker_D hoping for a higher-ranked candidate, I risk being left unmatched, as my position on A, B, and C's preference lists is low (4th or 5th). Securing a match with my 4th preferred candidate (who highly prefers me) immediately is the most stable and risk-averse strategy in this competitive environment. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_D."
