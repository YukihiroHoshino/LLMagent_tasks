Since all candidates ranked higher than me on your priority list have secured positions elsewhere, I am now the highest available candidate remaining. Accepting this application guarantees that Company_E fulfills its capacity requirement immediately and efficiently, aligning with your organizational goals in this final stage.",
              "thought": "I am Seeker_E, and Company_E is my absolute first choice (Rank 1). Despite four previous rejections, Company_E is the only company remaining unmatched. This implies that the four seekers Company_E ranked above me (Seeker_A, B, C, D) must have accepted offers from Companies A, B, C, or D, which are now matched. Therefore, Seeker_E is the highest available candidate for Company_E, even though I am their lowest preferred candidate overall. Given the market reality (Round 5, only two agents remaining), Company_E must accept me if they wish to fill their capacity. I must submit a formal application, emphasizing the finality of the market situation."

We have completed our final internal review, considering the current dynamics of the job market and the exceptional dedication you have demonstrated throughout this process.

              "thought": "I am Company_E, and my quota is 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E']. Seeker_E, my lowest priority candidate, is applying for the fifth time. Seeker_E asserts that all higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D) have secured positions elsewhere. Given the standard stable matching dynamics where Seekers generally match with their highest preferred Company (B, A, C, D, respectively) and all Companies prioritize A>B>C>D>E, it is highly probable that A, B, C, and D are matched, leaving Seeker_E as the only remaining available candidate. Since my goal is to match with the highest possible priority candidate within my quota, and Seeker_E is now the highest available candidate, rejecting them would likely result in an unfilled quota. Therefore, I should accept Seeker_E to fill my capacity."
