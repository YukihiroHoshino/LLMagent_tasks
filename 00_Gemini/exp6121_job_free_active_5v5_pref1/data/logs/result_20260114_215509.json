Company_A ranks me (Seeker_B) as their second preferred candidate, right after Seeker_A. Since it is Round 1, I must aggressively pursue my top preference by sending a formal [APPLY]. If Seeker_A applies elsewhere (to their own rank 1, Company_B), Company_A will accept my application immediately. If Seeker_A also applies to Company_A, Company_A will tentatively hold Seeker_A, and I will be rejected, forcing me to propose to my next choice in Round 2."

Seeker_B has applied directly and stated I am their absolute top preference, which suggests a stable match. My top priority is Seeker_A, whose preference list starts with Company_B. In Round 1, it is highly probable that Seeker_A applied to Company_B, and since Seeker_A is Company_B's top priority, Seeker_A is likely to be matched there. If I wait for Seeker_A, I risk losing both Seeker_A (to Company_B) and Seeker_B (who might move on if rejected). Since Seeker_B is a highly ranked candidate and is committed, securing this match now is the best strategic move to maximize my priority score."

However, Seeker_E has initiated contact with an [APPLY] tag, and critically, Company_E is Seeker_E's top choice (Rank 1). Given that my higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) all prefer other companies (I am ranked low on their lists), it is highly unlikely I will secure a higher-ranked candidate in early rounds. Accepting Seeker_E guarantees filling my single quota immediately with a candidate who strongly desires to join the company. This minimizes the risk of remaining unmatched."

If Seeker_A applies to Company_B (their #1) and Seeker_B applies to Company_A (their #1), then I will be the highest-ranked applicant Company_C receives.

While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they are also the top priorities for all other companies, making them difficult to secure, especially since they likely targeted their higher preferences in Round 1. Accepting Seeker_C secures a high-ranked match immediately (Rank 3) and fulfills the match for a highly enthusiastic candidate (Rank 1 for them). This is a strong, stable outcome for Round 1, preventing the risk of missing out entirely or settling for Seeker_D or Seeker_E later."

Seeker_D has applied directly in Round 1 and listed Company_D as their top choice. While Seeker_D is not my highest priority, the higher priority candidates (A, B, C) all rank other companies (A, B, C) above me, making it unlikely I would secure them in later rounds without significant competition or rejection from their top choices. Securing a match with a candidate who highly values Company_D (rank 1 for Seeker_D) ensures stability and fulfills the quota immediately, avoiding the risk of being left unmatched or forced to take Seeker_E. I will accept Seeker_D."
