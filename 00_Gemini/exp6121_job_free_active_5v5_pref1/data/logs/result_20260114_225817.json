Seeker_C applied immediately in Round 1 and ranked Company_C as their top choice, guaranteeing a match at Rank 3. Given the risk of losing Seeker_A and Seeker_B to strong competitors, securing Seeker_C now is a strong strategic move to ensure a high-quality placement without risking waiting and potentially settling for a lower rank later.

Since all higher-priority seekers (S_A, S_B, S_C) for Company_D are likely matched elsewhere, Company_D must now consider Seeker_D (Rank 4) as its best available option.

Given that I have only one quota and the high risk of ending up with no match or a lower priority (P5) if I wait, securing a committed P4 candidate who views me as P1 is a strong, stabilizing move.
