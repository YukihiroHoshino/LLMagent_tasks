I anticipate that other highly preferred candidates (like Seeker_A, who is Company_A's P1) will likely apply to their own top choices (Seeker_A's P1 is Company_B), leaving Company_A available for me (P2).

Seeker_B has applied directly in Round 1, indicating strong commitment. Furthermore, Seeker_B ranks Company_A as their first choice. While Seeker_A is my Rank 1, they likely applied to their top choice, Company_B, and I have not received an application from them. Given the high priority of Seeker_B and their enthusiasm, securing a Rank 2 match immediately is a very strong outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with no match or a low-ranked match if I wait for Seeker_A, who is likely unavailable."

Crucially, Company_C is Seeker_C's 1st preference, meaning this match is highly stable for the Job Seeker. While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they did not apply in this round, likely pursuing their top choices (Company_A or Company_B). Rejecting Seeker_C risks losing the only candidate who applied and might lead to an unfilled quota or a match with a much lower priority later. Since Seeker_C is a highly motivated applicant and ranks reasonably high (3rd), securing this match immediately is the optimal strategy to maximize the outcome given the current inbox."

Since Company_E is my Rank 1 choice and appears to be the only available option, I must re-apply. My previous rejection was likely due to competition from higher priority seekers who are now gone.

Seeker_E is my lowest priority (5th). However, Seeker_E is highly committed, ranking Company_E first, and is the only candidate who has applied to me in three consecutive rounds. Higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) rank Company_E very low (last or second-to-last). Since this is Round 3 and none of the higher-ranked candidates have shown interest, it is highly probable that they are matching with their preferred companies (A, B, C, D). Continuing to reject Seeker_E risks ending the simulation with an unfilled quota, as higher-ranked seekers are unlikely to turn to Company_E. Securing a match, even with the 5th priority candidate, is now the optimal move to guarantee filling the quota, given the market dynamics and my low standing among the top seekers."
