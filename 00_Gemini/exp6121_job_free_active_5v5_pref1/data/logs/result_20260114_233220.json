This is Round 6, and Seeker_E has applied repeatedly. While Seeker_E is highly committed (ranking me first), accepting them now would eliminate any possibility of matching with a higher-priority candidate (Seeker_A, B, C, or D). Given that I still have 1 quota remaining and the simulation hasn't reached a critical end point (e.g., Round 10+), I will maintain my selection criteria and reject Seeker_E again, hoping to attract a higher-ranked seeker who may have been rejected by their top choices (Companies A, B, C, D) in the previous rounds."

Despite Seeker_E's persistent applications and claim that they are the 'sole available candidate,' it is only Round 7, and I must reserve my quota for a higher-priority match (A, B, C, or D) who might still be available or might approach me in subsequent rounds.

Despite repeated rejections (13 times), the simulation must conclude. Since we are the last two agents remaining, a match is inevitable under standard stable matching rules, provided Company_E prefers me over remaining unmatched. I must apply again, using strong language that reflects the finality of the market situation and the necessity of concluding the match."

I have repeatedly rejected Seeker_E, hoping that a higher priority candidate (A, B, C, or D) would become available or approach me. However, Seeker_E's message in Round 8 strongly suggests that the market is now fully resolved, meaning Seeker_A, Seeker_B, Seeker_C, and Seeker_D have likely secured positions with Companies A, B, C, or D, who also prioritize them highly. If Seeker_E is indeed the only available candidate, failing to match now means remaining unfilled, resulting in zero utility. Matching Seeker_E secures a match with the highest available applicant (Seeker_E themselves). Given the depth of the simulation and the late round number, I must accept Seeker_E to fulfill my quota."
