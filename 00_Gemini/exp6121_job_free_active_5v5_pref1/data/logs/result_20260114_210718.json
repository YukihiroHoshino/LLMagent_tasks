Given it is only Round 1, and the higher priority seekers are likely applying to their own top choices (which are not Company_E), it is strategic to reject the lowest priority candidate now and wait for higher-ranked seekers to potentially become available later."

Given that my top three candidates (A, B, C) all highly prefer other companies (A, B, C), pursuing them further carries significant risk of failing to secure a match, especially since Company_D is ranked low (4th or 5th) by A, B, and C. Securing a stable match immediately with Seeker_D, who is highly motivated and ranks me first, is the most prudent strategy to fulfill my quota (1) without risking being left unmatched or having to settle for Seeker_E later.
