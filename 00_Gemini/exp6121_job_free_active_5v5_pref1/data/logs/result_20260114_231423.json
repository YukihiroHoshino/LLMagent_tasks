In stable matching algorithms (like Deferred Acceptance, which this interaction style mimics), it is crucial to apply to the highest ranked preferred option immediately. Company_D ranks me 4th ('Seeker_D' is 4th on their list). However, based on the preferences of Seekers A, B, and C, they are likely to target their own top choices (B, A, and C, respectively). Since Company_D is a low priority for the top seekers (A, B, C rank D as 4th or 5th), there is a high probability that I will be the most preferred applicant to Company_D in this round. Therefore, I should send an [APPLY] immediately to secure my top choice."
