If this distribution occurs, Company_D, despite ranking me 4th, will likely only receive my application (or perhaps S_E's, but S_E prefers E). Since Company_D has capacity 1, and I am the highest priority applicant they are likely to receive (assuming S_A, S_B, S_C go elsewhere), an aggressive application ([APPLY]) is the best strategy to secure my Rank 1 choice immediately."
