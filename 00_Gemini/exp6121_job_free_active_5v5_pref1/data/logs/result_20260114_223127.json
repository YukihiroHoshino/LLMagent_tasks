I will submit a formal application [APPLY] to Company_E."

However, Seeker_E has applied immediately in Round 1 and ranks Company_E as their top choice. Given that the higher priority seekers (A, B, C, D) all rank Company_E very low (4th or 5th) and are likely applying to their higher-ranked companies (A, B, C, D), the probability of securing a higher-ranked seeker is low. To guarantee filling my single quota, I will accept the offer from Seeker_E now, as they are a committed match."

Seeker_C is my third highest priority (Rank 3).\n\nIt is Round 1, and Seeker_C is the only applicant, having applied with [APPLY]. Seeker_C ranks Company_C as their top choice (Rank 1).\n\nConsidering the likely movements of my higher priorities (Seeker_A and Seeker_B):\n1. Seeker_A prefers Company_B (Rank 1) and Company_A (Rank 2). They likely applied there.\n2. Seeker_B prefers Company_A (Rank 1). They likely applied there.\n\nIf Seeker_A matches with Company_B (likely, as Company_B prioritizes Seeker_A highly) and Seeker_B matches with Company_A (likely, as Company_A prioritizes Seeker_B highly once Seeker_A is potentially matched elsewhere or if A decides to fill the spot), my top two priorities will be gone.\n\nIf I reject Seeker_C (Rank 3), I risk ending up with lower-ranked candidates (Seeker_D or Seeker_E) or failing to match, especially since Seeker_C views me as their best option. Securing a strong, stable match (Rank 3 for me, Rank 1 for them) in Round 1 is the most robust strategy here. I will accept Seeker_C."

Seeker_B has applied directly in Round 1 with [APPLY], indicating high commitment (Company_A is Seeker_B's #1 preference). While Seeker_A is my top choice, Seeker_A prefers Company_B first. Waiting for Seeker_A risks losing both Seeker_A (to Company_B) and Seeker_B (who might move to Company_C or Company_B if rejected).

Seeker_D is ranked 4th. However, Seeker_D has made a formal application [APPLY] and indicated that Company_D is their top preference (Rank 1). Since my higher priority candidates (A, B, C) are highly sought after by all companies and have higher preferences for other companies (B, A, C), it is highly unlikely they would apply to me in Round 1. Rejecting Seeker_D risks losing a highly motivated and guaranteed match. Securing a match in Round 1, even with my 4th preference, is a stable strategy, especially since Seeker_D considers me their top choice. I will accept this application."
