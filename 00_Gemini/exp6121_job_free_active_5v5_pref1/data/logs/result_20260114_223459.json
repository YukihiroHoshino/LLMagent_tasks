Seeker_D has sent an [APPLY] message and ranks Company_D as their top choice. Since my top 3 priorities (A, B, C) all prefer other companies highly (B, A, C, E), it is unlikely they applied to me in Round 1. Rejecting Seeker_D (a guaranteed, high-preference match for them) risks remaining unmatched, as I only received one application this round.

Since the list of 'companies not yet matched' only includes Company_E, it is highly probable that Companies A, B, C, and D have successfully matched with those higher-priority seekers, removing them from Company_E's consideration pool.

I previously rejected Seeker_E to signal my interest in exploring higher priorities. Since we are in Round 3, and no higher priority candidate has approached me, continuing to reject the only guaranteed match risks ending up unmatched, especially since Seeker_E might accept an offer from another company (where they are ranked 4th or 5th) if they feel ignored.
