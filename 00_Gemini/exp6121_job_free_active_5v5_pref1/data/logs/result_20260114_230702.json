If Company_E receives only my application, they must accept it, despite my low priority ranking. Therefore, I will formally apply immediately."

However, Seeker_E has applied in Round 1 and ranks Company_E as their top choice. Crucially, I am the lowest preference for my higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D). It is highly likely that A, B, C, and D will be matched with their preferred companies (A, B, C, D) who also prioritize them highly, leaving me unmatched if I reject Seeker_E.\nGiven the high risk of remaining unfilled if I wait for candidates who rank me last, accepting Seeker_E, who is eager to join, is a necessary defensive move to secure a match in Round 1."

I have rejected Seeker_D twice in previous rounds, likely hoping for P1, P2, or P3 candidates. However, Seeker_D is highly committed (D's P1 choice is Company_D) and has applied persistently for the third time. In stable matching environments, if the top candidates (A, B, C) haven't approached me by Round 3, it is highly probable they are pursuing or have matched with their much higher-ranked preferences (A, B, C are P4 or P5 for Company D). If I reject Seeker_D again, I risk losing my highest available candidate, as Seeker_D might move to their P2 choice (Company A), which could accept them if their own top priorities are matched. To secure a match and fulfill my quota, accepting Seeker_D (P4) is the optimal strategy at this point, as waiting further carries too much risk for minimal potential gain."
