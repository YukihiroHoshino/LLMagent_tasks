It is likely that Seekers A, B, and C will apply to their respective higher preferences (C_B, C_A, C_C) in Round 1, where they are also highly ranked. Therefore, applying immediately to Company_D in Round 1 offers the best chance to secure it if the higher-ranked seekers prioritize their own top choices elsewhere.
