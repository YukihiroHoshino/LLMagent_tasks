Given the companies' identical priority lists (A > B > C > D > E), and assuming other seekers apply to their top choices (Seeker_A to Company_B, Seeker_B to Company_A, Seeker_D to Company_D, Seeker_E to Company_E), Company_C is likely to receive only my application among the top prioritized candidates (A and B are likely matched elsewhere).

Seeker_C is my 3rd priority, which is still highly desirable. In Round 1, Seeker_C is the only candidate who applied to me, and crucially, I am Seeker_C's top choice. My higher priorities, Seeker_A and Seeker_B, are likely applying to their own top choices (Company_B and Company_A, respectively). Since Seeker_C is actively applying and ranks me 1st, accepting this match secures a high-priority candidate immediately, preventing the risk of missing out entirely if Seeker_A and Seeker_B successfully match elsewhere.

Although Seeker_E has applied and expressed high interest, accepting this offer in Round 1 would prevent me from matching with any of my higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_A through Seeker_D).

In Round 1, Seeker_D has applied directly and ranked Company_D as their 1st choice. Given that Seeker_A, Seeker_B, and Seeker_C are highly sought after by other companies (and they ranked other companies higher than D), it is highly likely they will match elsewhere quickly. Accepting Seeker_D (Rank 4) guarantees a successful match immediately, which is preferable to risking failing to match or only matching with Seeker_E (Rank 5) in later rounds.

Seeker_E is now arguing that all higher-ranked candidates are matched elsewhere, making them the highest available candidate.
