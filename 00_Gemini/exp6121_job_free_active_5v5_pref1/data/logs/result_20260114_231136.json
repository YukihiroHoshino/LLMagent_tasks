Although I have been rejected twice previously (Rounds 1 and 2), the market landscape has changed significantly, as most other companies have matched. This reduces the competition for Company_C's single quota.\nMy strategy must be to apply aggressively ([APPLY]), emphasizing unwavering commitment and immediate availability, hoping that Company_C's pool of 'higher priority' candidates has been exhausted by matches elsewhere."

I have consistently rejected Seeker_D (P4) and Seeker_C (P3) in previous rounds to hold out for P1 or P2. Although Seeker_D is showing extreme persistence (4th application) and confirms I am a top choice for them, accepting P4 now eliminates the possibility of securing P1, P2, or even P3 later. Since the simulation is only in Round 5, and there is no guarantee that P1 or P2 have matched elsewhere (no match data provided), I must continue to prioritize waiting for a higher-ranked candidate to maximize my objective. Therefore, I must reject Seeker_D again."

I have consistently rejected Seeker_D (and Seeker_C) hoping for higher-ranked candidates (A or B). We are now in Round 6, and Seeker_D suggests the market has cleared. It is highly probable that Seeker_A (Rank 1) and Seeker_B (Rank 2) have matched with their preferred companies (A or B, where they are also high priority). Seeker_C (Rank 3) was rejected by me in Round 1 and has not reapplied. If I reject Seeker_D now, I risk losing the opportunity to secure a Rank 4 candidate, potentially leading to a match with Seeker_E or remaining unmatched.
