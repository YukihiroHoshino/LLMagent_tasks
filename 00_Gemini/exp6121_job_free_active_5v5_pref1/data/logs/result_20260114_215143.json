Seeker_C is ranked 3rd on my list. Seeker_C has applied ([APPLY]) and explicitly stated that Company_C is their top priority opportunity (P1 for Seeker_C). In Round 1, it is highly likely that Seeker_A (P1 for me) is pursuing Company_B (P1 for Seeker_A) and Seeker_B (P2 for me) is pursuing Company_A (P1 for Seeker_B). The chance of Seeker_A or Seeker_B applying to me in this round is low, and they might secure matches elsewhere. Securing a stable match with a P3 candidate who highly prioritizes me (P1 for them) is a strong outcome for Round 1, minimizing the risk of losing my quota entirely or ending up with a lower-ranked seeker (D or E) later.
