While Seeker_A, Seeker_B, and Seeker_C are higher priorities, the market structure suggests they are very likely to match with other Companies (A, B, C) whom they prefer more (and who also rank them highly, as all companies rank A, B, C highly). Waiting for a higher-ranked candidate (1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice) who views Company_D as their 4th or 5th preference is highly risky. Seeker_D views Company_D as their 1st preference, guaranteeing a stable match.
