Seeker_E is my lowest priority (5th). Although Seeker_E is highly dedicated and views me as their top choice, accepting them now (Round 4) closes my opportunity to match with my four higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D). Given that the simulation runs up to 30 rounds, I have sufficient time to wait for a better potential match to become available, especially since I have consistently rejected Seeker_E in previous rounds to maintain this strategic flexibility. I will reject Seeker_E again to keep my quota open."

While I respect your previous feedback regarding specific profile requirements, the current market reality dictates that I am the highest-ranked available candidate who can immediately fulfill your capacity. Choosing to remain unmatched serves neither of our interests. I am prepared to commit fully and deliver exceptional results. I formally apply now to secure this final, mutually beneficial match.",

Since all other companies are presumably matched, Company_E faces the choice of accepting me (their 5th preference, but the only remaining seeker) or remaining unmatched. I have been rejected four times based on 'profile match'. I must make a final, strong application, emphasizing that I am the only available candidate left to fill their capacity, making this a mutually stable and efficient match in the current market context."

After careful reconsideration of our long-term staffing needs and recognizing the value of your dedication and willingness to commit immediately, we are pleased to reverse our previous decision. We formally accept your application and look forward to welcoming you to the team.",

Seeker_E is my lowest priority (Rank 5). I have rejected Seeker_E four times in previous rounds hoping for a higher-ranked candidate (A, B, C, or D). However, Seekers A, B, C, and D all rank Company_E very low (last or second to last). By Round 5, it is highly likely that these higher-priority seekers have matched with companies they prefer (A, B, C, or D). Continuing to reject Seeker_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched entirely. Since Seeker_E is highly dedicated (I am their top choice) and they are the only applicant, securing this match now (Rank 5) is the rational decision to fulfill the quota, rather than risking failure to match at all."
