Analyze competition (Round 1 assumption: everyone applies to their true Rank 1):\n    - Seeker_A's Rank 1 is Company_B.\n    - Since Seeker_A is likely applying to Company_B, I should be the highest priority applicant Company_A receives in Round 1.\n\nTherefore, applying directly to Company_A in Round 1 is the optimal strategy to secure a stable match immediately."

Since Seeker_A (P1) did not apply this round, securing Seeker_B (P2) immediately is a very strong outcome and minimizes the risk of losing high-ranking talent in subsequent rounds.

If other seekers follow the same rational strategy (proposing to their top choice), Company_E is likely to receive few, if any, applications other than mine, as it is a low preference for most other seekers.

Given that Companies A, B, C, and D are likely the preferred choices for my higher priority candidates (Seekers A, B, C, D), it is highly unlikely that those candidates will ever approach Company_E, as I am ranked last on their preference lists.

All other companies (A, B, C) also prioritize A, B, and C highly. It is very likely that A, B, and C will match in R1 with those companies.\n\nIf I reject Seeker_D (Rank 4), I risk losing the opportunity to match with anyone higher than Seeker_E (Rank 5).
