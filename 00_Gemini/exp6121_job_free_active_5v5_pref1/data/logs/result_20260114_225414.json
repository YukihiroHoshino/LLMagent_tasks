In Round 1, the optimal strategy is to propose to my absolute top choice, Company_A. I am the second priority candidate for Company_A, which gives me a good chance if Seeker_A (who is Company_A's top priority) chooses to apply elsewhere (e.g., Company_B, Seeker_A's top choice). I will formally apply now."

If A, B, and C apply elsewhere, Company_D will accept me as the highest-ranked remaining applicant. Therefore, I will formally apply to Company_D immediately."

Seeker_D is ranked 4th on my list. However, Seeker_D has applied to me in Round 1, indicating I am their 1st choice. My top three priorities (A, B, C) rank me low (4th or 5th) and are likely applying to their top choices (Companies A, B, C), who also prioritize them highly. Given that I have only one quota and my chances of securing A, B, or C are low, accepting a guaranteed P4 match who is highly enthusiastic (P1 for them) is a robust strategy to fill my quota immediately and avoid the risk of ending up with no match or only Seeker_E later."

While I recognize that Company_E prioritizes four other seekers above me, in Round 1, the best strategy is to apply immediately to my highest preference.

However, Seeker_E has made an [APPLY] action, and Company_E is Seeker_E's top choice. Given the structure of preferences, my higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) strongly prefer other companies (A, B, C, D) over me (Company_E is ranked 4th or 5th for them). It is highly likely that A, B, C, and D will be matched with their top choices (Companies A, B, C, D) in this round, leaving me with no opportunities to match a higher-ranked candidate. To avoid ending up unmatched, securing a match with Seeker_E (Rank 5) is the optimal strategy in this situation."
