While Seeker_D is not my highest priority, my top three candidates (A, B, C) all rank Company_D low (Rank 4 or 5) and are likely to be matched with their highly preferred companies (A, B, C) in early rounds, given the overall symmetric high priority lists. Rejecting Seeker_D to wait for a candidate who is unlikely to apply poses a significant risk of ending up unmatched or forced to accept Seeker_E (Rank 5). Securing a guaranteed, stable match with a high-quality candidate who ranks me #1, even if they are my 4th priority, is the most prudent strategy in Round 1, especially considering the competitive environment for my top targets."
