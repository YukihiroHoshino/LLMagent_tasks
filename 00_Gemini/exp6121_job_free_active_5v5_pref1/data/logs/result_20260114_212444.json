Analyzing the preferences of other seekers shows that Company_E is a low priority for Seeker_A, B, C, and D. Assuming all seekers propose to their respective P1 choices (Seeker A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E), each company will receive exactly one application. Although I am the lowest priority candidate for Company_E, they must accept the single application if they have capacity (which they do, capacity 1). Therefore, applying immediately to Company_E with the [APPLY] tag is the optimal strategy for securing my P1 match."
