If all seekers propose to their top choice in Round 1, Company_A will only receive a proposal from me (Seeker_B).\nCompany_A ranks me (Seeker_B) 2nd overall.

Seeker_B, my Rank 2 candidate, has applied directly in Round 1 and ranks Company_A as their top choice (R1). While Seeker_A (R1) is preferred, there is no guarantee Seeker_A will apply to me, especially since Seeker_A's top choice is Company_B. Rejecting Seeker_B risks losing a highly desirable candidate if they match with their subsequent preferences (Company_C, Company_B, etc.) in the next round. Securing a Rank 2 match who views me as Rank 1 is an excellent outcome for Round 1, fulfilling my quota with high mutual satisfaction. I will proceed with acceptance."

If no higher-ranked seeker applies to Company_E, Company_E should accept my application, filling their capacity of 1. I will use the [APPLY] tag immediately."

My objective is to match with the highest possible priority Job Seeker.\nIn Round 1, my top candidates (Seeker_A, B, C, D) are likely applying to their top choices (Company_A, B, C, D), where they are also highly prioritized. While Company_E is ranked low by A, B, C, and D, accepting the lowest priority candidate immediately prevents me from potentially securing a higher-ranked candidate if they become available in later rounds.\nGiven that the difference between Rank 5 and Rank 4/3/2/1 is significant, I will risk waiting and reject Seeker_E's application in Round 1, hoping that a higher-ranked candidate fails to match and considers Company_E later. This strategy prioritizes maximizing match quality over immediate quota fulfillment."

Seeker_C ranks Company_C as their 1st choice, indicating a very stable potential match. While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priority, they did not apply this round, likely applying to their own top choices (Company_A or Company_B). Given that all companies prioritize A and B highly, it is likely A and B will be matched early by other companies. Securing Seeker_C, who is a high-priority candidate and highly motivated (1st preference), is a strong strategic move to fill my single quota immediately and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked or no match later. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_C."

However, Seeker_D has submitted an [APPLY] and ranks Company_D as their absolute top choice (1st preference). Since this is Round 1, higher priority candidates (A, B, C) are likely applying to companies they prefer more highly (A, B, C rank Company_D 4th or 5th). Rejecting Seeker_D means losing a highly stable match and risking ending the simulation unmatched, as securing A, B, or C is unlikely due to their low preference for Company_D. Therefore, securing the highest-ranked candidate who actively applied and highly prefers Company_D is the best strategic move to ensure a successful match in Round 1."
