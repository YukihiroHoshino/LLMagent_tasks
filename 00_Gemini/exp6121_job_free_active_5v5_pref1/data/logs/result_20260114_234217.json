Since all other companies (A, B, C, D) and presumably the higher-priority seekers (A, B, C, D) are matched, Company_E must now accept me if they prefer matching to remaining unmatched. I have applied four times and been rejected because I am their lowest priority candidate (P5). However, in this final stage of the market, Company_E has no better options. I must apply again and emphasize the urgency and finality of the situation to secure my P1 match."

Seeker_E's message indicates that the market has fully cleared, meaning all higher-priority candidates (Seeker_A, B, C, D) are likely matched with other companies. Given that I have consistently rejected Seeker_E in previous rounds while holding out for higher-ranked seekers, and now Seeker_E is the only remaining option, accepting Seeker_E is the strategic choice to fulfill my quota rather than ending the simulation unmatched. While Seeker_E is the lowest priority, they are still on my list, and securing a match is preferable to remaining empty at this stage."
