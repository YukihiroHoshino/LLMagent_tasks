I have consistently rejected Seeker_E in previous rounds, hoping for a higher-ranked candidate. However, in Round 6, Seeker_E is the only applicant and strongly suggests that they are the sole remaining job seeker available in the market ('the necessary and final candidate'). Given the history (5 previous rejections without applications from higher-ranked candidates) and the need to secure a match rather than leave the quota unfilled, it is now strategically necessary to accept Seeker_E. Matching with my lowest priority is better than matching with no one."
