However, Seeker_C has applied directly in Round 1, and critically, Company_C is Seeker_C's absolute top choice. My higher priorities, Seeker_A (prefers B, A) and Seeker_B (prefers A), are likely engaging with their top choices and did not contact me this round. Accepting Seeker_C secures a stable match immediately with a highly desired candidate (Rank 3) who views me as their ideal employer. The risk of waiting for Seeker_A or Seeker_B, who prefer other companies, and potentially losing Seeker_C to Company_B or Company_A (C's 2nd and 3rd choices) is too high, given my limited quota of 1. I will accept Seeker_C."

While Seeker_A is my absolute top choice, Seeker_A's preference list places Company_B first, suggesting Seeker_A likely applied elsewhere this round. Seeker_B, conversely, placed Company_A first on their preference list, indicating strong mutual interest.

While Seeker_D is not my highest priority, my top candidates (A, B, C) are highly desirable and likely applied to companies they prefer (A, B, or C), who also prioritize them highly. The chance of securing A, B, or C is low. Accepting Seeker_D secures a guaranteed match with a highly motivated candidate (their #1 choice) in Round 1, fulfilling my quota at a satisfactory rank (4/5).

Seeker_E is highly dedicated, choosing Company_E as their top preference, and has applied for the third consecutive round. Given the advanced stage (Round 3) and the lack of interest from higher-ranked candidates, continuing to hold out poses a significant risk of remaining unmatched.
