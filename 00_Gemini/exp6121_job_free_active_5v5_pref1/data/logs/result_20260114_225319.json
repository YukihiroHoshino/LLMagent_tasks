However, Seeker_C has listed Company_C as their top preference (P1). Since this is Round 1, securing a P3 match who strongly prefers me is a strong outcome, especially considering that my P1 (Seeker_A) and P2 (Seeker_B) candidates likely applied to their higher preferred companies (Company_A or Company_B). Accepting this application secures my quota with a highly motivated candidate before they are potentially matched elsewhere, reducing the risk of being left with only P4 or P5 candidates later.

I need to assess the availability of higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D).\n\nBased on the preferences, Seeker_A applied to Company_B, Seeker_B to Company_A, Seeker_C to Company_C, and Seeker_D to Company_D (all their R1 choices).\nSince all companies share the same high priority list (A > B > C > D > E), and these applicants are high on the respective companies' lists (A is rank 1 for B, B is rank 2 for A, C is rank 3 for C, D is rank 4 for D), it is highly probable that all higher-ranked seekers (A, B, C, D) will be matched in this round.\n\nIf I reject Seeker_E, I risk ending Round 1 unmatched, as all higher priorities will likely be gone. Accepting Seeker_E secures a match (Rank 5 utility), which is better than ending up with 0 matches. Therefore, accepting Seeker_E is the optimal strategic move in this scenario."
