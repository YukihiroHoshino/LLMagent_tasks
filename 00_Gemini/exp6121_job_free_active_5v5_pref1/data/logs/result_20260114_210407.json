Seeker_E's Rank for Company_E: 1 (Highest possible).\n2. Company_E's Priority for Seeker_E: 5th (Lowest).\n\nIf all seekers follow the greedy strategy and propose to their top choice, the proposals are distributed uniquely across all companies (A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E). In this specific scenario, Company_E receives only one proposal (from Seeker_E). Since Company_E prefers any seeker over remaining unmatched, Company_E will accept Seeker_E's proposal.

It is highly likely that Seeker_A applied to Company_B (R1 for A, R1 for B) and Seeker_B applied to Company_A (R1 for B, R2 for A).
