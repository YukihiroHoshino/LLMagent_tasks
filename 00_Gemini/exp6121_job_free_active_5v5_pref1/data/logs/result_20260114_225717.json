Since this is Round 1 and quotas are limited (Capacity 1), applying directly to my top choice is the best strategy to maximize utility, assuming other seekers might target their own unique top preferences. Company_C ranks me 3rd (behind Seeker_A and Seeker_B). If Seeker_A targets Company_B and Seeker_B targets Company_A (their respective top choices), I will be the only applicant for Company_C and secure the match immediately. I must use [APPLY] to be considered for acceptance this round."

Seeker_C has submitted an [APPLY] request and indicated that Company_C is their top choice. Given that this is Round 1, it is highly likely that Seeker_A and Seeker_B have applied to their absolute top choices (Company_B and Company_A, respectively). Since all companies prioritize A and B highly, A and B are likely to secure matches elsewhere immediately. If A and B match out, Seeker_C (P3) represents the best available candidate for Company_C. Accepting Seeker_C now secures a strong match (P3) and fulfills the quota, preventing the risk of remaining unmatched or having to settle for a lower priority later."

If this happens, Company_D will only receive a proposal from me (Seeker_D).\nCompany_D ranks me 4th, but since I am the only applicant in this scenario, they should accept my proposal (Capacity 1). Therefore, proposing to Company_D immediately with an [APPLY] tag is the optimal strategy for securing my rank 1 preference."

Seeker_D has applied directly in Round 1 and ranks Company_D as their 1st choice. While Seeker_D is not my top priority, my higher priorities (A, B, C) all highly prefer other Companies (A, B, C) and are top priorities for those companies, making it unlikely they would apply to Company_D (their 4th or 5th choice) in Round 1, or even subsequent rounds if they secure a match elsewhere. Accepting Seeker_D now guarantees a stable match, fulfilling my quota immediately with a highly motivated candidate. I will accept this application."

I hypothesize that Seeker_A will pursue their top choice, Company_B, where they are also the top priority for that company.

Seeker_B is my second highest priority candidate (P2). Seeker_B has applied directly with [APPLY] and stated that Company_A is their absolute top choice (P1). While Seeker_A (P1) is preferred, they did not apply in this round, and likely applied to Company_B (their P1). Accepting Seeker_B secures a very high-quality match immediately (P2 for me, P1 for them), minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked candidate if Seeker_A matches elsewhere.

For the vast majority of my higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D), Company_E is their lowest preference (Rank 4 or 5), making it highly unlikely they will apply to me early, if at all. Given the extremely low probability of securing a higher-ranked candidate, and the risk of remaining unmatched if I reject the only applicant, I will accept Seeker_E to secure a stable match immediately and fulfill my quota."
