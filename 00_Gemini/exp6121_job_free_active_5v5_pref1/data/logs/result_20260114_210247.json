I have received an [APPLY] from Seeker_D, who lists Company_D as their #1 preference. My quota is 1.\n\nWhile Seeker_D is not my highest priority, my top candidates (A, B, C) are applying to their own top choices (Company_B, Company_A, Company_C, respectively). Given that all companies prioritize A, B, and C highly, it is extremely likely that A, B, and C will be matched in Round 1 with their preferred companies. If I reject Seeker_D, I risk being left with no match or having to settle for Seeker_E (my lowest priority) later, as Seeker_D is highly likely to secure a position elsewhere (their next preferences are A, C, B).\n\nSecuring a guaranteed match (Seeker_D, Rank 4) now is the optimal strategy to ensure I fill my quota with a relatively high-ranking candidate, rather than waiting for candidates who are unlikely to apply to me."

Accepting Seeker_C now secures a match (Rank 3) and fulfills my quota, preventing the risk of remaining unmatched if my top two choices match elsewhere or never apply to me.
