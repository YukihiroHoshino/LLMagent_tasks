Since this is Round 1, and Seeker_A, Seeker_B, and Seeker_C did not apply to Company_D (likely applying to their higher preferred companies like A, B, or C), holding out for a P1, P2, or P3 match is risky, as those seekers are less likely to choose Company_D later if they are rejected by their top choices. Securing a stable match with a highly interested applicant in Round 1, even if they are P4, is a reasonable strategy to meet the quota. I will accept Seeker_D."

In Round 1, Seeker_C has applied directly, indicating strong interest (Company_C is Seeker_C's #1 choice). While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are ranked higher, they both prefer other companies (A prefers B/A, B prefers A). It is unlikely they applied to me in Round 1. Securing my 3rd choice immediately, especially one who strongly prefers me, is a stable outcome, fulfilling my quota early and avoiding the risk of being left with lower-ranked or no candidates later.

Seeker_B has applied to me with [APPLY] and ranks Company_A as their #1 choice.\n\nMy top priority, Seeker_A, prefers Company_B over Company_A and likely applied there in Round 1. Waiting for Seeker_A is risky, as they might secure a match with Company_B or another higher preference company, leaving me potentially unmatched or forced to accept a much lower priority candidate later.\n\nSecuring Seeker_B (Rank 2) is an excellent outcome for Round 1, especially since they are eager to join.
