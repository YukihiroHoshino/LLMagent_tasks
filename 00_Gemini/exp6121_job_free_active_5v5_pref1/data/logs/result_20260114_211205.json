Company_D is a low priority for Seeker_A (4th), Seeker_B (5th), and Seeker_C (4th). Therefore, there is a good chance that Company_D receives few or no applications from seekers ranked higher than me in this initial round. I will aggressively apply to my Rank 1 choice, Company_D, to try and secure the best possible outcome immediately."

However, Seeker_D has sent an [APPLY] and listed Company_D as their #1 preference. In Round 1, securing a stable match, especially when higher priority candidates (A, B, C) are unlikely to target me (as they prefer Companies A, B, or C, who also prioritize them highly), is crucial. Rejecting Seeker_D risks ending the simulation unmatched if A, B, and C are matched by other companies. Therefore, accepting Seeker_D guarantees filling my quota with a committed candidate, preventing future uncertainty."

Seeker_C, my 3rd priority, has submitted an [APPLY] in Round 1. Seeker_C also ranks Company_C as their #1 preference. While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priority, they likely applied to their own top choices (Company_B/A and Company_A, respectively), where they are also highly ranked.

However, Seeker_E ranks Company_E as their absolute top choice (Rank 1/5) and has applied repeatedly, demonstrating strong commitment. Given that Company_E is the lowest preference for all higher-ranked seekers (A, B, C, D), it is highly improbable they will apply here, especially in early rounds. Since I have rejected Seeker_E once already and they are applying again in Round 3, securing this match guarantees I fill my quota, which is critical given my weak position in the overall preference hierarchy.
