Since all companies have a quota of 1, and Company_D will receive only one application (from me), they are expected to accept the offer, even though I am ranked 4th on their priority list. Therefore, I should immediately apply to maximize the chance of securing my top choice."

I have received an application only from Seeker_D in Round 1. Although Seeker_D is not my top priority, the chances of attracting my top three candidates (A, B, C) are very low, as they all rank Company_D 4th or 5th and likely applied to their higher preferred companies (A, B, C). Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their P1. Securing a P4 match immediately, especially with a seeker who is highly committed, is a strong outcome given my low ranking in the market. I will accept Seeker_D to fill my quota."
