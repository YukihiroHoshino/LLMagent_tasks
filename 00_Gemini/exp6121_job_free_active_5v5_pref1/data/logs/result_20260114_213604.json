Seeker_D, my 4th priority, has submitted an [APPLY] request. Crucially, Seeker_D ranks Company_D as their #1 choice, ensuring this match is highly stable from their side. My top 3 priorities (A, B, C) all rank Company_D 4th or 5th, meaning they are highly unlikely to be applying to me in Round 1, as they pursue their higher preferences (A, B, C). Accepting Seeker_D (4th priority) secures a guaranteed match and fulfills my quota early with a highly interested candidate, minimizing the risk of remaining unmatched, which is a significant possibility if I rely on attracting my top 3 choices who rank me low. Therefore, I will accept Seeker_D."

While Seeker_A and Seeker_B are higher priorities, they are also highly desirable to other companies (especially Company_A and Company_B), and they likely applied to their top choices (Company_B/A). Since Seeker_C offers a stable match (Rank 3/Quota 1) and lists us as #1, securing this match now is prudent, guaranteeing a positive outcome early in the process rather than risking being left with lower-ranked candidates or unmatched later.
