Given that P1 and P2 are highly sought after and likely to secure matches elsewhere immediately, accepting Parent_C (P3) guarantees a match, which is a strong outcome in Round 1. Rejecting P3 carries the risk of remaining unmatched or matching with an even lower priority parent later if P3 secures a match with their second choice (Nursery_B). Therefore, securing a match with P3 now is prudent."

The higher-ranked parents (A, B, C) all prefer other nurseries (A, B, C) over me, and those nurseries also prioritize A, B, and C highly. Therefore, the chance of Parent_A, Parent_B, or Parent_C being rejected by their top choices and subsequently applying to me is low.
