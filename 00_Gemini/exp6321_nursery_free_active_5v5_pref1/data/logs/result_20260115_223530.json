As I am the 4th priority at Nursery_D, this is my best chance to secure my top choice immediately. I will formally apply."

While Parent_D is not my top choice, Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_C all rank Nursery_D very low (4th or 5th), making it highly unlikely they will apply to me early on. Parent_D ranks Nursery_D as their top choice, guaranteeing a stable match. Given the strong commitment from Parent_D and the low probability of attracting higher-ranked candidates, accepting Parent_D now secures my quota."

Although Nursery_E rejected me in Round 1, the fact that it is still listed as 'not yet matched' implies that its capacity might still be open, or that it is waiting for applications. Since Nursery_E is my P1 choice, I must try again, assuming that higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) might have been matched to their own P1 choices (B, A, C, D, respectively) or elsewhere, freeing up a spot for me, the lowest priority applicant at Nursery_E.

In Round 1, I strategically rejected Parent_E (my lowest priority, Rank 5) hoping to attract higher-ranked parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D). However, in Round 2, Parent_E is the only applicant, and they are highly committed (Nursery_E is their top choice). Given that Nursery_E is the last choice for three of my higher-priority parents (P_A, P_C, P_D) and the 4th choice for P_B, the likelihood of attracting a significantly better applicant in later rounds is low. To avoid the risk of remaining unmatched, I must accept the highest available applicant. Since Parent_E is the only applicant in the inbox, I will accept their application now to secure my quota."
