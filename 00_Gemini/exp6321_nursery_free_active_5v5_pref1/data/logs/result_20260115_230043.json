Parent_B's #1 is Nursery_A. It is highly likely that Parent_A and Parent_B will apply to their respective top choices in Round 1, as they hold high priority there.\nIf they follow their true preferences, I will be the highest-priority applicant for Nursery_C (my #1 choice).\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to apply formally to Nursery_C immediately to secure the match."

Parent_C has applied immediately in Round 1 and designated Nursery_C as their absolute top choice (P_C's 1st preference). While Parent_A and Parent_B are higher priority for me, they both prefer other nurseries (Nursery_A and Nursery_B) and are likely applying there this round. Rejecting Parent_C carries the risk of losing this guaranteed Rank 3 match, potentially leaving me with only Rank 4 or 5 parents if P_A and P_B successfully match elsewhere and P_C moves to their second choice (Nursery_B). Securing a Rank 3 match who is highly committed is a strong outcome for Round 1. I will accept Parent_C."

Nursery_D prioritizes Parent_A, B, C above me (Parent_D). However, Parent_A's top choice is B, Parent_B's top choice is A, and Parent_C's top choice is C. Assuming rational behavior where parents apply to their top choice first, it is highly likely that Nursery_D will receive few, if any, applications from parents ranked higher than me in Round 1.

If this deduction is correct, Nursery_E has no higher-priority parents left to choose from. Since remaining unmatched is usually the worst outcome for a nursery, Nursery_E should now accept Parent_E.
