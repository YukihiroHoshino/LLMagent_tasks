Since Parent_C is ranked 3rd overall, they are the highest priority applicant among the received applications (which is just one). Therefore, Nursery_C should accept Parent_C immediately.

I must decide whether to accept them or wait for higher-ranked Parents (P_A or P_B).\n\nBased on the preference lists, P_A likely applied to N_B (P_A's Rank 1) and P_B likely applied to N_A (P_B's Rank 1). Since N_B prefers P_A (Rank 1) and N_A prefers P_B over all others who applied to N_A (P_A applied elsewhere), P_A and P_B are highly likely to be matched in Round 1 with N_B and N_A, respectively. \n\nTherefore, Parent_C is the highest-ranked Parent remaining who is applying to me. Rejecting Parent_C would leave me unmatched, hoping for a rejection from a higher-ranked Parent who is already likely matched elsewhere. Accepting Parent_C secures the best possible match given the current proposals. I will accept Parent_C."

My top 3 priorities (A, B, C) all rank Nursery_D as their 4th or 5th choice, meaning they are highly likely to be matched with N_A, N_B, or N_C this round.

The higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) all rank Nursery_E very low (4th or 5th), meaning they are highly likely to be matched by Nurseries A, B, C, or D in this round, as all nurseries share the same high priority for A, B, C, and D. If I reject Parent_E, I risk ending the simulation with an empty quota, as higher priority parents are unlikely to turn to me. Since Parent_E is highly interested and currently the only applicant, securing this match (Rank 5) is preferable to risking an unfilled quota."
