It is highly probable that P_A, P_B, and P_C will secure matches immediately. If I reject Parent_D, I risk ending up unmatched or only being able to match with Parent_E (P5) later. Since Parent_D is committed (P1 preference), accepting this application secures a match at P4, which is a reasonable outcome given the competitive market for my P1, P2, and P3 candidates.
