Given the preference lists of P_A, P_B, and P_C, they are highly unlikely to apply to me in early rounds, as they have much higher-ranked nurseries (A, B, C) that also prioritize them highly. It is likely that P_A, P_B, and P_C will be matched with N_B, N_A, and N_C respectively in this round. Therefore, Parent_D is effectively the highest-ranked parent available to me who has demonstrated interest.
