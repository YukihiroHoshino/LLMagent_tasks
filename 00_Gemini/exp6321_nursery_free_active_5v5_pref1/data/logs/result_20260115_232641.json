Given that other parents are likely applying to their respective top choices (Nursery_A for P_B, Nursery_B for P_A, Nursery_C for P_C, Nursery_E for P_E), it is highly probable that Nursery_D will receive only my application.

Since Parent_D listed Nursery_D as their absolute first choice, and my higher priority parents (A, B, C) are likely applying to and securing matches with nurseries they prefer (where they are also highly ranked), waiting for them carries a high risk of remaining unmatched.\nAccepting Parent_D secures a match immediately. While Parent_D is not my top priority, they are the best available candidate who has proactively applied. Given the structure of the market where my top priorities rank me low (4th or 5th), securing this match is prudent."

If Nursery_A accepts Parent_A (their top priority), Parent_B will be rejected and will move to their second choice, which is Nursery_C. \nBy rejecting Parent_C now, I keep my spot open for the higher-ranked Parent_B in Round 2.
