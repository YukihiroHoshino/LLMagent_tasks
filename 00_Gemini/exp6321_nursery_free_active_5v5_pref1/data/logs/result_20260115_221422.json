Since this is Round 1, I should propose to my top choice, Nursery_C. \n\nAnalyzing the market: If all parents propose to their top choice (A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E), every nursery receives exactly one application. Since Nursery_C receives an application only from Parent_C, they will accept me, regardless of my priority rank (3rd overall), because I am the best available candidate in this round. Therefore, proposing immediately with [APPLY] to Nursery_C is the dominant strategy to secure my rank 1 choice."

Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B, and N_B prioritizes P_A highest (Rank 1). A match is highly likely.\n2. Parent_B's top choice is Nursery_A, and N_A prioritizes P_B second (Rank 2), but since P_A is likely going to N_B, N_A will likely accept P_B. A match is highly likely.\n\nGiven that my top two preferences (P_A and P_B) are very likely to match with their top choices (N_B and N_A) in this round, Parent_C (Rank 3) is the highest available parent remaining. Since Parent_C also ranks me first, accepting their application guarantees a match at my highest likely achievable rank.

Since Nursery_E is my rank 1 choice and the only available option, and it is currently empty, I must re-apply.

However, Parent_E has applied to me twice and ranks me as their absolute first choice. In Round 1, I rejected Parent_E hoping for a higher-ranked applicant (A, B, C, or D). Since none of the higher-ranked parents have applied to me, and considering that Nursery_E is the 4th or 5th choice for all high-priority parents, the likelihood of securing a match with Parent A, B, C, or D is extremely low. To avoid remaining unmatched, securing Parent_E now is the optimal strategy, despite them being my lowest priority, as they guarantee filling my single quota. I will accept this application."
