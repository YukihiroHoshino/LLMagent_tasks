Although I am the 3rd priority applicant overall (behind Parent_A and Parent_B) at Nursery_C, neither Parent_A (who prefers B) nor Parent_B (who prefers A) is likely to propose to C in Round 1. Assuming rational behavior from other parents proposing to their P1 choices, I should be the only applicant for Nursery_C, guaranteeing an acceptance."

Since this is Round 1 and I have not received applications from my higher-ranked choices (Parent_A or Parent_B), who likely applied to their own top choices (Nursery_B/Nursery_A and Nursery_A respectively), accepting Parent_C secures a match and fulfills my quota early.
