If they follow their preferences, Nursery_D will receive no applications from parents ranked higher than me (Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C) in Round 1.

While I prefer Parent_A, B, or C, those parents are highly likely to match with Nurseries A, B, or C, as I am low on their preference lists. Rejecting Parent_D carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched or being left only with Parent_E (Rank 5) later.
