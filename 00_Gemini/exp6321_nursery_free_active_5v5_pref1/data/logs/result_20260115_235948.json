It is now Round 3, and Parent_E is applying for the third time, demonstrating extreme commitment (ranking me 1st). Since I have received no applications from higher-priority parents in the previous rounds, and they are likely focused on their top choices (Nursery A, B, C, D), the probability of securing a match with Parent_A, B, C, or D is decreasing rapidly.
