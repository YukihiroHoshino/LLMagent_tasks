My top choice is Nursery_A.\nNursery_A ranks me (Parent_B) as their second priority, after Parent_A.\nI must consider Parent_A's move. Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B. Parent_A is also the highest priority for Nursery_B. Since all capacities are 1, Parent_A is highly likely to secure Nursery_B immediately.\nIf Parent_A matches with Nursery_B, I become the highest priority applicant remaining for Nursery_A. Therefore, applying directly to my top choice, Nursery_A, in Round 1 is the optimal strategy, as I anticipate being accepted (or tentatively held) once Parent_A is off the market."

However, Parent_E has applied immediately in Round 1, indicating high commitment. Crucially, Nursery_E is the last choice for Parents A, C, and D, and the second-to-last for Parent B. It is extremely unlikely that I will receive an application from a higher-ranked parent (A, B, C, or D) before they secure a spot elsewhere, as all other nurseries (A, B, C, D) are significantly preferred by them. Accepting Parent_E now secures a match and fulfills my quota, preventing the risk of remaining unmatched later. Although Parent_E is low priority, they are still acceptable."

Although I am 4th on their list, the three higher priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_C) all have different top choices (N_B, N_A, N_C respectively).\n\nAssuming rational behavior in Round 1 where all parents apply to their top choice: P_A goes to N_B, P_B goes to N_A, and P_C goes to N_C. This leaves Nursery_D primarily contested by P_D (me) and potentially P_E (who ranks N_D 5th). Since I am the highest ranked applicant for N_D among those who rank it first, I have a high chance of being accepted in this round.\n\nTherefore, I will formally apply to my top choice, Nursery_D."

Instead, I will use the [TALK] tag to express continued strong interest and maintain a line of communication.
