Given that other parents are likely applying to their respective top choices, and based on the symmetry of the problem (everyone choosing a different nursery), it is highly probable that Nursery_D will accept my application, even though I am 4th on their priority list, as no higher-priority parent (A, B, or C) is expected to apply to Nursery_D in this round."

This is Round 1, and Parent_D is the only applicant currently in my inbox.\n\nStrategically, my top 3 priorities (A, B, C) rank Nursery_D as their 4th or 5th choice, meaning they are highly likely to have applied to and secured spots at their higher preferred nurseries (Nursery A, B, or C) in this round, given the symmetrical priority lists across all nurseries. If I reject Parent_D, I risk remaining unmatched, as better candidates are unlikely to apply later.\n\nSince Parent_D is a committed applicant (Rank 1 for them) and I have an open quota, accepting Parent_D now secures a match, preventing the risk of being left with no match, which is preferable to waiting for low-probability higher-ranked applicants."
