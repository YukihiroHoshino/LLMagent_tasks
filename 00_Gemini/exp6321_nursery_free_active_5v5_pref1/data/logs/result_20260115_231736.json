Parent_B (Rank 2) has applied immediately in Round 1. Parent_B also ranks Nursery_A as their top choice. The only parent ranked higher than Parent_B is Parent_A (Rank 1). Parent_A's top preference is Nursery_B. Since Parent_A did not apply to me this round, they likely applied to Nursery_B. Accepting Parent_B secures a highly desirable match (Rank 2) immediately. Waiting for Parent_A is risky, as they might be accepted by Nursery_B, leaving me with lower-ranked options later, or Parent_B might secure a spot elsewhere (Nursery_C or Nursery_B). Therefore, I should accept Parent_B."

It is highly probable that these parents are currently applying to their top 3 choices (Nursery_A, B, C, D) in Round 1.\n\nSince I have only one application this round, and the chances of a higher-ranked parent applying to me later are low due to their preferences, accepting Parent_E guarantees a match and fulfills my quota.
