Given that this is Round 1, the optimal strategy in a DA-like environment is to propose to my top choice immediately. I am aware I am the 4th priority at Nursery_D. However, checking the top preferences of the higher priority parents (P_A->N_B, P_B->N_A, P_C->N_C), it is highly likely that they will propose to their respective top choices, leaving Nursery_D only receiving my application. Therefore, applying directly to Nursery_D should result in an immediate match."

While P_D is not my top choice, my top choices (P_A, P_B, P_C) are highly preferred by other nurseries (A, B, C) and rank Nursery_D low (4th or 5th). It is highly probable that P_A, P_B, and P_C will secure matches with their higher preferred nurseries in Round 1. If I reject Parent_D, I risk losing the opportunity to secure a match, as P_D will move on to their second choice (Nursery_A).

Since this is Round 1, I must consider the location of my top two choices, Parent_A (P1) and Parent_B (P2).\nParent_B ranks me as their 2nd choice, and Parent_A ranks me as their 3rd choice. They are likely applying to their 1st choices (Nursery_A or Nursery_B) this round. If they are rejected by those nurseries, they will turn to me in Round 2.\nIf I accept Parent_C now, I secure P3, but I sacrifice the chance to match with P1 or P2. Given the high likelihood that P1 and P2 might approach me next round (especially Parent_B), it is strategically optimal to reject Parent_C now and keep my quota open for a higher-ranked parent."

In Round 1, applying to the top choice is the standard strategy in matching markets, especially since all nurseries have capacity 1 and are currently unmatched. \r\n\r\nI anticipate that other parents might also apply to their respective top choices: P_A to N_B, P_B to N_A, P_C to N_C, and P_D to N_D. If this happens, Nursery_E will only receive one application (from me), meaning I will be accepted despite having the lowest priority rank overall (P_E is last on N_E's priority list). Therefore, applying immediately to Nursery_E maximizes my immediate utility without risk of being rejected by a higher preference in this specific round setup."

However, Parent_E is the only applicant in Round 1, and they rank Nursery_E as their top choice. The higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) all rank Nursery_E very low (4th or 5th), meaning they are highly unlikely to apply to me unless rejected by most other nurseries. Rejecting Parent_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as the higher priority parents are unlikely to reach out. Since securing a match (even the lowest ranked one) is preferable to remaining unmatched, and given the low likelihood of attracting a higher-ranked parent in subsequent rounds, I will accept Parent_E to secure the allocation."

Parent_C is still available and highly committed (Nursery_C is their P1 choice). Rejecting Parent_C now carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as the lower priority parents (P_D, P_E) are also likely matched to their top choices (N_D, N_E).
