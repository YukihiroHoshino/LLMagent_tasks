Given the structure of preferences where most parents' top choices are distinct (P_A->N_B, P_B->N_A, P_C->N_C, P_D->N_D, P_E->N_E), it is highly probable that Nursery_D will only receive one application, mine.

Parents A, B, and C have higher priorities for me, but they all rank me 4th or 5th in their preferences, meaning they are likely applying to other nurseries (Nursery A, B, or C) in this initial round. Waiting for a higher-ranked parent is extremely risky as they are unlikely to be rejected by their top choices and reach me in later rounds. Securing a match with Parent_D, who is highly committed and available now, is the optimal strategy to ensure my quota is filled early in the process, despite them being Rank 4.

Based on market analysis (assuming all high-priority parents matched with their rank 1 choices, as they were also the nurseries' top priorities for those applicants), Nurseries A, B, C, and D are likely matched. The current list confirms that only Nursery_E remains unmatched.\nSince Nursery_E is my Rank 1 choice and is the only remaining option, I must apply again. My previous rejection was likely due to Nursery_E holding out for higher priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D). Since those parents are now matched elsewhere, Nursery_E's priority pool has effectively shrunk, making Parent_E the highest remaining priority parent available to Nursery_E.
