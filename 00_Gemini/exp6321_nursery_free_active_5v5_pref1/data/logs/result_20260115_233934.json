In this case, Nursery_D will only receive an application from me (Parent_D). Since Nursery_D has capacity 1, and I am the only applicant, they will accept me, despite my low priority ranking (4th).

While Parent_D is not my top choice, analyzing the market suggests that my higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C) are highly likely to secure matches with their top choices (Nursery_B, Nursery_A, Nursery_C respectively) in Round 1, as those nurseries also rank them highly and are not currently facing strong competition from the very top candidates. If I reject Parent_D, I risk ending up unmatched entirely, as A, B, and C are unlikely to reach me (I am their 4th or 5th choice).

It is highly probable that Parent_A applied to Nursery_B in this round and will be accepted there, as Parent_A is also P1 on Nursery_B's priority list.

Although I was rejected by Nursery_C in Round 1, since they are the only nursery remaining and they are my top choice, I must re-apply. Nursery_C ranks Parent_C third on its priority list, and since Parent_A and Parent_B must have matched elsewhere (or Nursery_C would have matched with one of them and thus be unavailable), I am now the highest-priority applicant available to Nursery_C.

I rejected Parent_C in Round 1, hoping to attract Parent_A or Parent_B, who are higher on my list. However, in Round 2, only Parent_C has reapplied (still showing high commitment, as I am their 1st choice). Given that I have not received applications from P_A or P_B, it is highly likely that they have already matched with Nurseries B or A, who also prioritized them highly. Rejecting Parent_C again carries the risk of them matching elsewhere (e.g., Nursery_B, their 2nd choice) and leaving me unmatched or forced to accept a lower priority parent later (P_D or P_E). Securing a match with my 3rd highest priority parent, who is committed, is a strong outcome. I will accept Parent_C."
