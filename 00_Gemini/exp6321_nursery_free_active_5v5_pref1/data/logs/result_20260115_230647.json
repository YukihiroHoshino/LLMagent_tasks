Since no higher priority parent (P_A or P_B) is applying to Nursery_C, and I am the highest priority applicant applying to Nursery_C in this round, I should apply immediately to secure the match.

While Parent_A and Parent_B are higher on my list, they likely applied to their own top choices (Nursery_B/A and Nursery_A, respectively).

Parent_D has submitted an [APPLY] request and lists Nursery_D as their top choice. While I prefer Parent_A, B, and C, those parents have significantly higher preferences for other nurseries (A, B, C) and are unlikely to apply to Nursery_D (4th or 5th choice for them) in Round 1. Given that Parent_D is my only applicant this round, and accepting them guarantees a stable match (P4), rejecting them risks being left unmatched or having to accept Parent_E later. Securing a P4 match now is safer than speculating on higher-ranked parents who have strong matches elsewhere. I will accept Parent_D."

Parent_E has reapplied in Round 2, showing strong commitment, and I have received no applications from higher-ranked parents. Given that Parents A, B, C, and D all list Nursery_E as their 4th or 5th choice, it is highly probable they have secured matches with their preferred nurseries (Nursery_A, B, C, D) in Round 1. Therefore, the chance of receiving an application from a higher-ranked parent in subsequent rounds is extremely low. To secure a match and fulfill my quota (1), accepting Parent_E now is the prudent decision, as an allocation at rank 5 is better than being unmatched."
