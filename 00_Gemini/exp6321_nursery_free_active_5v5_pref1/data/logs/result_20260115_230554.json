In Round 1, Parent_D has submitted an [APPLY] tag, stating I am their first choice. Although Parent_D is not my highest priority, the market dynamics suggest that Parents A, B, and C (my top 3) are highly likely to match with Nurseries A, B, and C, as those nurseries also prioritize them highly and those parents list those nurseries higher than D. Accepting Parent_D now guarantees a stable match, fulfilling my quota in the first round with an acceptable candidate (4th ranked). This is a prudent decision to avoid the risk of failing to match or being forced to match with Parent_E later."

Although Parent_E is the lowest priority for Nursery_E (5th), since Nursery_E has a capacity of 1 and no higher priority parent is applying, I should formally [APPLY] immediately to secure my top choice."

Given that the higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) rank Nursery_E very low in their preferences, they are highly likely applying to other nurseries in Round 1. Rejecting Parent_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as I am not a preferred choice for the top candidates.

In this market structure, it appears that applying directly to my top choice in Round 1 is the optimal strategy, based on the assumption that other parents (P_A and P_B) who have higher priority at Nursery_C will likely apply to their own respective top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively) where they also hold high priority. If P_A and P_B apply elsewhere, I, as the 3rd priority, have a good chance of being accepted immediately by Nursery_C. I will submit a formal application."

Parent_C has applied to me ([APPLY]) and I am their top choice. While Parent_A and Parent_B are higher on my list, they likely applied to their own top choices (Nursery_B/A for A, Nursery_A for B) this round.
