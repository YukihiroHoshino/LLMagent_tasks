If they apply elsewhere, Nursery_D will likely only receive applications from me (Parent_D) and possibly Parent_E (who ranks D 5th). Since I am the highest priority parent likely to apply to D, applying here aggressively in Round 1 is the optimal strategy to secure my top choice."

While Parent_D is not my top choice, my preferred candidates (P_A, P_B, P_C) all rank me 4th or 5th, and they are likely applying to and matching with Nurseries A, B, or C, who rank them highly. Rejecting Parent_D risks me remaining unmatched, as the higher-ranked parents are unlikely to become available. Since Parent_D ranks Nursery_D as their top choice, this is a secure and stable match. Securing a match in Round 1 is prudent given the low preference I receive from my top choices."

Parent_B also ranks Nursery_A as their top choice. While Parent_A (P1) is preferred, Parent_A's preference list starts with Nursery_B, making it likely they applied there first.

However, Parent_E has contacted me with an [APPLY] and states I am their absolute top choice, indicating high commitment. Crucially, I am the last choice for Parent A, B, C, and D, meaning I am unlikely to receive applications from my higher-ranked parents in early rounds. Rejecting Parent_E carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as my market standing is weak.
