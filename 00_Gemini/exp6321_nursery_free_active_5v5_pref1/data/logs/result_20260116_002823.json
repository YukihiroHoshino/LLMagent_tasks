However, if other parents (P_A and P_B) apply to their own top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively), Nursery_C will only receive an application from me in Round 1. Since Nursery_C has a capacity of 1, they are likely to accept my application, resulting in a match with my highest preferred nursery."

Parent_A's 1st choice is Nursery_B. Nursery_B prioritizes Parent_A first. They are highly likely to match.\n2. Parent_B's 1st choice is Nursery_A. Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_B second (after Parent_A). Since Parent_A applied to N_B, N_A is likely to accept Parent_B (Rank 2 for N_A).\n\nBased on this analysis, the two parents ranked higher than Parent_C are likely to match with their respective first-choice nurseries in Round 1.

Rejecting Parent_C carries a high risk of losing a guaranteed Rank 3 match without a strong prospect of acquiring a Rank 1 or Rank 2 parent later.\n\nI will accept Parent_C to secure a high-quality match immediately."
