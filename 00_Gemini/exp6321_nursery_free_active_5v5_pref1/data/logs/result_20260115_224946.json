Nursery_A has a capacity of 1. I am Parent_B, ranked 2nd on Nursery_A's priority list (behind Parent_A).

Parent_B has submitted a formal [APPLY] application, indicating I am their top preference. My Rank 1 choice, Parent_A, prefers Nursery_B first. Since Parent_A is also Nursery_B's top priority, it is highly likely Parent_A will match with Nursery_B this round, making Parent_A unavailable to me. Accepting Parent_B secures a high-quality match (Rank 2) immediately, preventing Parent_B from seeking other options (like Nursery_C, their second choice) in subsequent rounds.

Parent_C has contacted me with an [APPLY] tag, indicating I am their top choice (P1 preference). While Parent_A (P1) and Parent_B (P2) are higher priorities for me, they did not apply this round, suggesting they proposed to Nurseries they prefer more (Nursery_A or Nursery_B). Accepting Parent_C secures a match with a highly interested parent (P1 preference) who is reasonably high on my priority list (P3). Since waiting risks losing Parent_C and potentially not receiving applications from Parent_A or Parent_B in the future if they match elsewhere, securing this match in Round 1 is the optimal strategy."

Since this is Round 1 and no matches have been made, the optimal strategy in a preference-based allocation system is to propose to my highest ranked choice. I am the 4th priority (P_D) for Nursery_D, meaning I am less preferred than P_A, P_B, and P_C. However, based on the stated preferences of the other parents, P_A is likely targeting N_B, P_B is targeting N_A, and P_C is targeting N_C. This leaves Nursery_D potentially open for me.

Parent_D is my 4th priority. Currently, Parent_D is the only Parent who has applied, and they have designated me as their top choice (P1). While Parent_A, B, and C are higher priority for me, they are unlikely to apply to me in Round 1 as I am low on their preference lists (4th or 5th). Given that I have an application from a legitimate, high-interest candidate (Parent_D), and I have a remaining quota of 1, I should accept this guaranteed match rather than risk remaining unmatched in subsequent rounds waiting for higher priority parents who might never apply."

In Round 1, I applied to Nursery_E and was rejected, likely because I am the lowest priority parent (P_E is rank #5) and Nursery_E might have been holding out for a higher priority parent. However, based on the deduction that Nurseries A, B, C, and D are matched, all higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) are now unavailable. Nursery_E must realize that Parent_E is their only remaining option to fill their quota. Since Nursery_E is my top choice and the only available option, I must re-apply immediately and emphasize our commitment and the current lack of alternatives for both parties."

I rejected Parent_E in Round 1, hoping that a higher priority parent (P_A, P_B, P_C, or P_D) who might have been rejected by their first choice would apply to me in Round 2. In Round 2, only Parent_E has applied again. The lack of applications from P_A, P_B, P_C, or P_D strongly suggests they have successfully matched with their higher preferences (N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D) in Round 1 or are currently pursuing options higher on their lists than Nursery_E (who is their 4th or 5th choice). Since Parent_E is highly committed (applying twice) and is the only candidate applying, accepting them secures my quota, which is preferable to remaining unmatched, even though they are my lowest priority candidate on the list."
