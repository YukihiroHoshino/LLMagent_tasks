Since I am their 5th preference, they are unlikely to apply to me until they are rejected by all four other nurseries. However, accepting Parent_E now uses up my single quota and guarantees I miss out on potentially matching with Parent A, B, C, or D, who are all higher priority.

Accepting Parent_B now secures a highly ranked, committed match (Rank 2) without risking losing them in subsequent rounds while waiting for Parent_A, who is unlikely to become available.

Given that Parent_A and Parent_B likely applied to their 1st choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively), and those nurseries rank them highly (N_B ranks P_A 1st, N_A ranks P_B 2nd but P_A proposed N_B), it is probable that Parent_C is the highest ranked applicant available to me in this round.
