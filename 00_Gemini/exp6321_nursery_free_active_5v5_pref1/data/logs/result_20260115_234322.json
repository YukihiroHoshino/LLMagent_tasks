Given that this is Round 1, I should apply directly to my top preference, anticipating that other parents (A, B, C, E) will likely apply to their respective top choices (Nursery_B, A, C, E). If this holds true, I will be the sole applicant for Nursery_D, guaranteeing a match despite my 4th position on Nursery_D's priority list."

Parent_D is ranked 4th on my list and has submitted an [APPLY]. While I would prefer Parents A, B, or C, an analysis of the market shows that these parents highly prefer other nurseries (A, B, C) and are also the top priorities for those nurseries. Parent_D, however, lists Nursery_D as their top choice. Given the high competition for my top 3 priorities (P_A, P_B, P_C are 4th or 5th choices for me, but 1st or 2nd choice for the other highly sought nurseries), securing a guaranteed match with Parent_D (Rank 4) in Round 1 is the most prudent strategy to ensure my quota is filled."

Since this is Round 1 and all nurseries are available, applying immediately to my top choice is the optimal strategy. Although I am the 3rd priority at Nursery_C (behind Parent_A and Parent_B), I must apply and hope that Parent_A and Parent_B apply to their higher preferences (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively)."

Since this is Round 1, and Parent_C has applied directly ([APPLY]), securing a P3 match immediately is a good strategic decision, minimizing the risk of remaining unmatched or having to settle for P4/P5 later. Although Parent_A and Parent_B are higher priority, they are likely applying to their own P1 or P2 choices (Nursery_B/A for Parent_A; Nursery_A/C for Parent_B).

In a standard matching process (like DA), the best strategy is to apply to the most preferred option first. I am the lowest priority applicant for Nursery_E (Rank 5), but based on the stated preferences of the other parents, it is highly likely that they will apply to their respective R1 choices (N_B, N_A, N_C, N_D). If they do, Nursery_E will only receive one application (from me) in Round 1, ensuring a match. I will formally apply to maximize the chance of securing this top preference immediately."

However, Parent_E is the only applicant I have received in this round, and they have submitted a formal application ([APPLY]). Looking at the overall market preferences, Parents A, B, C, and D all rank Nursery_E last (5th choice). It is highly improbable that any of those higher-ranked parents will apply to me unless they are rejected by four other nurseries first. Rejecting Parent_E now carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as the higher priority parents are unlikely to ever apply here. Since Parent_E is a definite match and guarantees the use of my quota, I will accept this application rather than risk being left empty."

However, Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B. Assuming all parents act truthfully based on their revealed preferences in Round 1, Parent_A will apply to Nursery_B. Since Nursery_A's priority list is Parent_A > Parent_B, if Parent_A applies elsewhere, I become the highest priority applicant at Nursery_A. Therefore, applying immediately to my top choice, Nursery_A, maximizes my chance of securing my Rank 1 match in this round."

Parent_B is my second-highest priority (Rank 2). Parent_B has applied directly and ranks me as their first choice. Although Parent_A is my top priority, they have not applied this round, and they prefer Nursery_B first. Securing a match with Parent_B, who is a highly desired candidate and has committed their top preference to me, is a strong outcome in Round 1. The risk of waiting for Parent_A and losing Parent_B is too high. I will accept Parent_B."
