However, if all other parents also apply to their top choices (P_A to N_B, P_B to N_A, P_C to N_C, P_E to N_E), Nursery_D will only receive my application and will accept me, despite my lower priority rank compared to others who applied elsewhere.

Parent_D (my 4th priority) has applied immediately in Round 1, indicating I am their first choice. While Parent_A, B, and C are higher priorities for me, they all rank other nurseries (A, B, or C) much higher than me. Given the high demand for A, B, and C across the market, they are likely to match with their preferred nurseries quickly. Rejecting a guaranteed match with Parent_D risks leaving my quota unfilled if my top priorities secure matches elsewhere. Since Parent_D is enthusiastic and a guaranteed match, securing this allocation is the optimal strategy in this decentralized environment, even though they are my 4th choice."

Since Parent_E is the lowest priority for Nursery_E, the previous rejection in Round 1 was likely due to Nursery_E holding the spot for a higher-priority parent. Now that higher-priority competition is gone, Parent_E is the next available candidate.
