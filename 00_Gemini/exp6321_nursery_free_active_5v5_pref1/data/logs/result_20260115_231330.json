This makes N_E highly unlikely to receive applications from parents A, B, C, or D in Round 1, as they will target their own top choices (N_B, N_A, N_C, N_D respectively).\nThis is my best chance to secure my top choice immediately before higher-ranked parents start exploring lower preferences in subsequent rounds.

This means that at Nursery_C, the higher priority parents (P_A and P_B) are likely applying elsewhere.

Securing Parent_C (Rank 3) early in the process, especially since they rank me 1st, is a strong move to fulfill my quota immediately and ensure a stable match, rather than risking being left unmatched or matched with a lower priority parent later.

Furthermore, A, B, and C all rank Nursery_D very low in their preferences (Ranks 4 or 5), meaning they likely applied to Nursery_A, B, or C. Rejecting Parent_D (who is committed and ranked 4th) carries a high risk of remaining unmatched, as the higher-ranked parents are unlikely to apply here later.

Parent_E is my lowest priority (5th). In Round 1, Parent_E applied and I rejected them, strategically hoping for higher-ranked applicants to become available (A, B, C, or D). However, based on the preferences of Parent_A, B, C, and D, and assuming standard matching behavior where they apply to their top choices (N_B, N_A, N_C, N_D respectively) and are accepted (as they are high priority for those nurseries), it is highly probable that P_A, P_B, P_C, and P_D are already matched. This leaves Parent_E as the only remaining unmatched applicant. Since matching with Parent_E (Rank 5) is better than remaining unmatched (Rank 6/Unfilled), and Parent_E is highly enthusiastic, I must now accept this application to fill my quota of 1."
