Although Parent_A (Rank 1) is preferred, Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B, and it is likely Nursery_B will accept Parent_A (as Parent_A is also Nursery_B's top priority).

In Round 1, it is highly probable that higher-priority parents will apply to their own top choices (Nursery_A, B, C, D). If Nursery_E receives no applications from parents A, B, C, or D, they must accept Parent_E, even though I am low priority.

While Parent_E is my least preferred choice, they rank me as their top choice (P1). My higher priority parents (A, B, C, D) rank me very low (P4 or P5) and are likely pursuing other nurseries (A, B, C, D) which they prefer.

Parent_D is highly committed, listing Nursery_D as their 1st preference and applying again in Round 2. Since Parent_A, B, and C rank me low (4th or 5th), the chances of them reaching out before securing a match elsewhere are low.
