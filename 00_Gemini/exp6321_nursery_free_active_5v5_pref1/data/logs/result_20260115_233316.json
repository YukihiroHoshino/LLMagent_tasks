Since this is Round 1, I must consider where Parent_A (Rank 1) and Parent_B (Rank 2) likely applied. Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B, and Parent_B's top choice is Nursery_A. Assuming Nursery_A and Nursery_B follow their priorities (which are the same as mine) and accept P_A and P_B respectively (or P_A and P_B secure matches at their P1/P2 choices), P_C represents the highest-ranked Parent remaining who has applied to me. Rejecting P_C carries a significant risk of ending up with only P_D or P_E later, or remaining unmatched.

If this holds, Nursery_D will only receive one application (from me) and should accept, leading to a Rank 1 match. I will therefore send a formal application immediately."

While I prefer Parent_A, B, or C, those parents rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, and are likely applying to their top choices (Nursery_B, Nursery_A, Nursery_C respectively), where they are highly prioritized. Accepting Parent_D now secures a match (P4) with a parent who considers us their absolute top choice (P1), mitigating the high risk of remaining unmatched if I hold out for higher priority parents who are unlikely to apply here soon.
