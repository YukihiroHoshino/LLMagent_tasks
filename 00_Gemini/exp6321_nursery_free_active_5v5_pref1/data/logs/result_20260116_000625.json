My true preference list is ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D'].\nIn Round 4, only Nursery_E is available (Rank 1).\nHistorically, I have applied to Nursery_E twice and been rejected, likely due to higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D) being in the pool.\nSince Nursery_E is the only school remaining unmatched, it strongly suggests that Parents A, B, C, and D have either matched elsewhere or definitively rejected Nursery_E.\nThis means Parent_E, despite being the lowest priority overall, is now the highest or only remaining viable candidate for Nursery_E.\nTherefore, I must send a third, decisive [APPLY] to secure the spot before the simulation ends, emphasizing immediate commitment and the current market reality."

I have previously rejected Parent_E twice hoping to attract a higher priority parent (A, B, C, or D). It is now Round 4, and Parent_E points out that the market has likely concluded, meaning higher priority parents have matched with their preferred nurseries (A, B, C, D), who also prioritize them highly. Given that Nursery_E is the last choice for Parents A, B, C, and D, it is highly probable that they are matched elsewhere. If I reject Parent_E now, I risk remaining unmatched. Since Parent_E is still applying and highly committed, they are currently the highest available candidate remaining in the pool. To fulfill my quota and maximize my outcome based on the available pool, I must now accept Parent_E."
