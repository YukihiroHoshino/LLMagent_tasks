Since this is Round 1 and all nurseries are available, I should apply directly to my Rank 1 choice, Nursery_D, to maximize my chance of securing a high-quality match immediately. Based on the likely first-round applications of other parents (P_A to N_B, P_B to N_A, P_C to N_C, P_E to N_E), Nursery_D is likely to receive only my application, despite me being ranked 4th on their priority list. Therefore, a direct application ([APPLY]) is the optimal strategy."

Higher priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_C) rank Nursery_D very low on their preference lists (4th or 5th), meaning they are highly unlikely to apply in Round 1. Rejecting Parent_D risks leaving my quota unfilled, as there is no guarantee that higher-ranked parents will ever reach out. Accepting Parent_D secures a stable match immediately, which is prudent given the low preference I receive from my top priorities. I will accept Parent_D."

Parent_B likely applied to Nursery_A (1st choice).\n\nIt is highly probable that Parent_A and Parent_B will be matched elsewhere this round, as they preferred other nurseries and are high priority for those nurseries as well. \n\nParent_C has applied directly to me in Round 1, indicating strong commitment (I am their 1st choice). While P_A and P_B are higher priority, securing a committed match at rank 3 early is a safe and strategic move, especially since waiting risks losing Parent_C if they are rejected and match elsewhere later, and the higher-ranked parents are unlikely to become available.\n\nSince Parent_C is the highest-ranked applicant I received this round and I have quota remaining, I will accept the application immediately."

Parent_E is my lowest priority candidate (5th choice), but they are my only applicant this round, and they have applied directly.\n\nI must consider the likely actions of the higher priority parents (A, B, C, D). Parent A, B, C, and D all rank other nurseries (B, A, C, D respectively) as their top choices. Given that all nurseries share the exact same priority list (A > B > C > D > E), it is highly probable that Parent A, B, C, and D will be accepted by their respective first-choice nurseries in Round 1, as they are likely high on those nurseries' lists.\n\nIf I reject Parent_E, I risk remaining unmatched, as the higher priority parents are unlikely to become available (I am their 4th or 5th choice) and will likely be matched elsewhere instantly.\n\nSince Parent_E is available and applied, and securing a match is essential, accepting Parent_E ensures I fill my quota, as waiting for a higher-ranked but highly unlikely applicant carries too much risk of being left unmatched."
