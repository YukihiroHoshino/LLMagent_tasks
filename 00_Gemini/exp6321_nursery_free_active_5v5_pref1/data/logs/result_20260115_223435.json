Parent_A (P1) has not applied. Given Parent_A's preference list starts with Nursery_B, it is highly probable they applied there. Since Nursery_B ranks Parent_A as P1, Parent_A is likely to be matched with Nursery_B this round. Therefore, Parent_B is the highest available priority candidate applying to me. Securing a match with my P2 in the first round is optimal under these circumstances."

Even though Parent_C is the 3rd priority at Nursery_C (P_A > P_B > P_C), since no higher priority parents are applying to N_C in Round 1, Parent_C has a high chance of being accepted immediately.

It is highly probable that P_A and P_B will be matched elsewhere this round. Therefore, rejecting Parent_C risks losing a secure match ranked 3rd on my list, potentially leaving me with only lower-ranked parents or unmatched. Securing Parent_C now is the optimal strategy."

Nursery_D has a capacity of 1. Although I am ranked 4th on Nursery_D's priority list, it is highly likely that other parents will target nurseries higher on their respective lists (Nursery_D is generally ranked low by others).

While Parent_D is not my top choice, they rank Nursery_D as their 1st preference, making this a highly stable potential match. My top 3 priorities (P_A, P_B, P_C) all rank Nursery_D low (4th or 5th), meaning they likely applied elsewhere in Round 1. Since I have a guarantee of filling my quota now with the highest-ranked applicant received this round (Parent_D), and the chances of securing a higher-ranked parent later are slim given their preferences and the competition from other nurseries (A, B, C), it is strategically sound to accept Parent_D now to secure the allocation."

I am the lowest priority parent for all nurseries (P_E). \n\nAnalyzing the likely applications in Round 1 (assuming all parents apply to their top choice):\n- P_A applies to N_B (Priority 1 for N_B)\n- P_B applies to N_A (Priority 2 for N_A)\n- P_C applies to N_C (Priority 3 for N_C)\n- P_D applies to N_D (Priority 4 for N_D)\n- P_E applies to N_E (My 1st choice).\n\nIf I apply to my second choice, Nursery_B, I will certainly be rejected as Parent_A (highest priority) will likely apply there. \nIf I apply to Nursery_E, which is the 4th or 5th choice for all higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D), it is highly probable that I will be the only applicant to Nursery_E in Round 1. Since Nursery_E has capacity 1, even though I am the lowest priority, they should accept me if I am the sole applicant. \nTherefore, applying formally to my top choice, Nursery_E, maximizes my chance of an immediate match."

Given that I am ranked 4th or 5th by my higher priority candidates (A, B, C, D), it is highly likely those candidates will match with Nurseries A, B, C, or D, who are their higher preferences. Rejecting Parent_E poses a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as I am generally undesirable to my top choices.
