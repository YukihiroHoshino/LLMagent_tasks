In this scenario, every parent matches with their top choice, regardless of priority rankings, because all nurseries receive only one proposal and have a capacity of 1.

Given that Parents A, B, and C list Nursery_D as their 4th or 5th choice, it is highly unlikely they would apply here in Round 2, as they likely still have their 3rd preferred option open.
