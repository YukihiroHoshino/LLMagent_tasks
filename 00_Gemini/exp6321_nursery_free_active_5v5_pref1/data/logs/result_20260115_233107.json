If the other parents follow the strategy of proposing to their top choice, I will be the sole applicant for Nursery_D, guaranteeing an acceptance. Therefore, I will formally apply now."

However, Parent_D is the only applicant in Round 1, and they list Nursery_D as their absolute top choice, indicating high commitment. Given that my higher-ranked parents (A, B, C) all rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, it is highly unlikely they would apply in Round 1, or even subsequent rounds, unless they are rejected multiple times. To secure a match immediately and fulfill my quota without risk, accepting the committed applicant, Parent_D, is the optimal strategy, despite them being 4th on my list."

While I have the lowest priority ranking at all nurseries (including Nursery_E), analyzing the other parents' top preferences suggests they will apply elsewhere (P_A to N_B, P_B to N_A, P_C to N_C, P_D to N_D).

However, Parent_E is my only applicant in Round 1, and they have designated me as their top choice. Analyzing the market, it is highly probable that my higher-priority parents (A, B, C, D) will be matched with their respective top-choice nurseries (N_B, N_A, N_C, N_D) in this round, as all nurseries share the same priority list and these parents applied to their highly-ranked nurseries. Therefore, waiting for a higher-ranked parent is extremely unlikely to yield a better outcome. Securing a stable match now with Parent_E, who is still on my priority list, is the optimal strategy to fulfill my quota."

Analyzing the preferences of all other parents, it appears that each parent has a unique top choice in Round 1 (P_A -> N_B, P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_C, P_D -> N_D, P_E -> N_E). Assuming rational play where parents apply to their top choice initially, Nursery_C should only receive an application from me. Since Nursery_C has a capacity of 1 and I am the only applicant, I should be accepted, even though I am ranked 3rd on their priority list. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to apply immediately to my top preference, Nursery_C."

In Round 1, Parent_C has applied with an [APPLY] tag, stating I am their absolute first choice. My top two candidates, Parent_A and Parent_B, are likely applying to their top choices (Nursery_A and Nursery_B), who also rank them highly (P_A and P_B are rank 1 and 2 for all nurseries). It is highly probable that P_A and P_B will be matched elsewhere in this round or the next. Securing my rank 3 candidate (P_C) when they apply exclusively and view me as their top preference is a strong, stable outcome, ensuring I fill my quota with a highly desired parent."

My priority list is ['Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E']. Parent_B is my second highest priority. Parent_B has submitted a definitive [APPLY] in Round 1, indicating strong commitment (Nursery_A is their 1st choice). My top priority, Parent_A, likely applied to their top choice, Nursery_B, which also prioritizes Parent_A highly. Therefore, the chance of Parent_A becoming available to me is low. Accepting Parent_B (Rank 2) immediately secures an excellent match and fulfills my quota early in the process. This is a highly stable and desirable outcome."
