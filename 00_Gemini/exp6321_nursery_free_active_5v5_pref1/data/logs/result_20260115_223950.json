This makes applying to Nursery_A a strong strategic move in the first round."

It is highly probable that Parent_A is applying to and will be matched with Nursery_B in this round.

Nursery_A, B, and C are highly desirable for Parents A, B, and C (who all have higher priority than me). If A, B, and C apply to their top choices (B, A, C respectively), they will likely be matched immediately.\n2. Nursery_D is my #1 choice. For Parents A, B, and C, Nursery_D is ranked 4th or 5th. It is highly probable they will not apply to D in the first round.\n\nIf Parent A proposes to B, Parent B proposes to A, and Parent C proposes to C, then Nursery D will receive applications only from Parent D (my application) and possibly Parent E (who ranks D last). Since I am the highest priority applicant likely applying to D in Round 1, applying immediately to Nursery_D maximizes my chances of securing my top choice."

In this round, Parent_D, who lists Nursery_D as their absolute top choice, has submitted an official [APPLY]. Higher priority parents (A, B, C) have directed their applications elsewhere (N_B, N_A, N_C respectively), where they are highly prioritized and likely to be accepted in Round 1. If I reject Parent_D, I risk losing them to their second choice (Nursery_A) while failing to attract Parent A, B, or C, who are likely to match elsewhere. Since Parent_D is the highest-ranked applicant currently available to me and securing a match is crucial, accepting Parent_D is the optimal strategy to fill my quota based on the current market state."
