Analyzing the preferences of Parent_A and Parent_B: Parent_A prefers Nursery_B (P1) and Parent_B prefers Nursery_A (P1). Since Parent_A is ranked 1st everywhere and Parent_B is ranked 2nd everywhere, it is highly probable that they will secure their respective top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively, as they don't compete for the same P1). If A goes to B and B goes to A, Nursery_C will accept me immediately as I am the highest remaining priority applicant (Rank 3). Therefore, I should apply directly to my P1 choice, Nursery_C, in Round 1."

While Parent_A and Parent_B are higher ranked for me, they likely applied to their top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A, respectively) this round, as those nurseries also prioritize them highly.

In the standard Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance algorithm, P_E proposes to N_E, and since all other parents prefer other nurseries higher up on their lists (N_E is rank 4 or 5 for all other parents), it is highly likely that N_E will only receive an application from P_E in the first round. Given N_E's capacity of 1, and the low priority ranking of P_E (last), I must secure this match quickly before higher priority parents potentially change their strategy later. However, since the stable matching predicts P_E matching with N_E, I should proceed with a formal application immediately to secure my rank 1 choice."

Parents A, B, C, and D likely applied to their own top choices (Nursery A, B, C, D), and if they are rejected there, they might apply to me in subsequent rounds.

Assuming that in Round 1, parents A, B, and C successfully matched with their own high-ranking preferences (Nursery_B, A, and C respectively), Parent_D is now the highest priority remaining applicant for Nursery_D.

However, in Round 2, only Parent_D has applied again, showing strong commitment (Nursery_D is their top choice). Given that I am ranked low (4th or 5th) on the preference lists of Parent_A, Parent_B, and Parent_C, the likelihood of them applying to me before Round 3 is low.
