Although I am ranked 4th at Nursery_D, in this initial round, Nursery_D will only receive one application (from me, Parent_D) if all other parents also apply to their respective top choices.

Parent_D has applied and ranked me as their first choice. While Parent_D is not my top priority, my top three preferences (A, B, C) all rank me 4th or 5th, suggesting they are very unlikely to apply to me in early rounds, as they will target Nurseries A, B, or C first.

Assuming Nurseries follow the standard procedure of accepting the highest-ranked applicant who applies, Nursery_E should accept Parent_E.
