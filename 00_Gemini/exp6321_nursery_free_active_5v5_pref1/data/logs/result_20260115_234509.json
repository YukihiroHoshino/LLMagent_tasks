Parent_D has submitted a formal application ([APPLY]) and listed Nursery_D as their definitive first choice. Checking the preferences of my higher-ranked parents (A, B, C), they all rank Nursery_D as their 4th or 5th choice, meaning they are highly unlikely to apply to me in Round 1. Since Parent_D is committed and highly desires a match with me, and given the low likelihood of attracting P_A, P_B, or P_C, securing this match now prevents me from potentially remaining unmatched later. Therefore, accepting Parent_D is the optimal safe strategy."

My priority at Nursery_C is 3rd (behind P_A and P_B). Since P_A and P_B likely apply elsewhere (B and A respectively), applying to Nursery_C now offers a high chance of immediate acceptance."

If I wait for Parent_A or Parent_B, I risk remaining unmatched, as they are unlikely to apply to me (their 3rd and 2nd choice, respectively) after securing a match at their preferred nurseries.\n\nAccepting Parent_C secures the highest possible ranked match available to me in Round 1 (Rank 3).

The higher-ranked parents (A, B, C, D) all prefer Nurseries A, B, C, or D significantly over Nursery_E (E is ranked last or near last for all of them). Given that I have received no applications from higher-ranked parents in two rounds, the probability of securing Parent_A, B, C, or D is extremely low, and the risk of remaining unmatched increases with further rejection.
