Since Nursery_A prioritizes Parent_A first, but Parent_A prefers Nursery_B, Parent_B is the highest priority applicant likely applying to Nursery_A. Therefore, applying directly to Nursery_A now offers the best chance for an immediate match on my Rank 1 choice."

While Parent_A, B, and C are higher priorities, they did not contact me this round, likely applying to nurseries they preferred (Nursery_A, B, C).
