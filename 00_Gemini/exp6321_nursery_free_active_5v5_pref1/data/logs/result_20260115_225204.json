My higher priorities (A, B, C) all rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, meaning they are very unlikely to apply to me in early rounds, as they will target Nurseries A, B, or C first. Accepting Parent_D now secures a match where I am the Parent's top choice, which provides maximum stability and efficiency, rather than holding out for higher-ranked candidates who are unlikely to choose me.

In Round 2, only Parent_E reapplied. Since A, B, C, and D have strong preferences for other nurseries (A, B, C, D), it is highly improbable they will apply to me unless those nurseries are fully matched. Waiting further poses a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as Parent_E might match elsewhere. Securing a match, even with my 5th priority, is preferable to remaining empty.
