However, P_A, P_B, and P_C all rank N_D as their 4th or 5th choice, making it unlikely they will apply unless they fail everywhere else. Parent_D is reapplying and clearly committed (N_D is their 1st choice). If I reject Parent_D again, they will likely match with their 2nd or 3rd choice (N_A or N_C) in the next round, leaving me with potentially only P_E or an unfilled spot, as the higher priority parents are unlikely to apply to me.
