Parent_B likely applied to Nursery_A (P1 for Parent_B, P2 for Nursery_A). It is highly probable that Parent_A and Parent_B were accepted by their respective top choices in this round, making them unavailable.\n\nSince Parent_C is my highest actual applicant and is highly enthusiastic (ranking me P1), accepting P3 secures my required match immediately in Round 1, preventing the risk of being left unmatched later if P1 and P2 are indeed matched elsewhere.
