I must analyze the likelihood of securing a higher-ranked parent if I reject Parent_E.\n\nParents A, B, C, and D are applying to their respective top choices (Nursery B, A, C, D). Since all Nurseries share the same priority list, A will be accepted by N_B, B by N_A, C by N_C, and D by N_D (assuming they are N's top or only applicants, which they are, among the pool applying to them). Therefore, it is highly probable that my preferred candidates (A, B, C, D) will be matched or provisionally accepted by other nurseries they prefer over me.\n\nIf I reject Parent_E, I risk going unmatched entirely, as Parent_E is the only applicant currently interested in me (Nursery_E). Securing a match, even with my lowest ranked applicant, is preferable to remaining empty. Therefore, I will accept Parent_E."

Since this is Round 1 and I have not received applications from my top three preferences (who likely applied to their preferred nurseries: N_B, N_A, N_C), accepting Parent_D guarantees a match and fulfills my quota.

Since Parent_C is a highly ranked applicant, and securing a match early is generally beneficial, I should accept this application.
