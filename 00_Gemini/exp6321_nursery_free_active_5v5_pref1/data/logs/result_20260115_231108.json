Therefore, Nursery_D is likely to be less contested by high-priority parents in the initial round.\nSince Nursery_D is my #1 choice, and the probability of success is maximized by applying now while the competition is distracted, I will apply aggressively."

Parent_D (my 4th priority) has applied directly in Round 1, signaling high commitment as I am their absolute first choice. Crucially, none of my top three priorities (Parent_A, Parent_B, Parent_C) contacted me in this round, indicating they are pursuing their own higher preferences (Nursery_A, Nursery_B, Nursery_C). Given the competitive market structure where higher-ranked parents are actively seeking matches elsewhere, rejecting a committed applicant (Parent_D) who ranks reasonably well (4th out of 5) carries the risk of ending up unmatched or only matching with Parent_E later. Securing a committed match in Round 1 is strategically sound. I will accept Parent_D."

Analyzing the preferences of other parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D), I observe that Nursery_E is a low preference for all of them (ranks 4 or 5). Assuming all parents apply to their absolute top choice in Round 1, P_A will apply to N_B, P_B to N_A, P_C to N_C, and P_D to N_D. This leaves Nursery_E receiving only one application, from me (Parent_E).

It is highly unlikely that any higher priority parent will apply to me unless they are rejected by 4 other nurseries first.
