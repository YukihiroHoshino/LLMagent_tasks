Therefore, I should send a formal [APPLY] request to my top choice, Nursery_D, expecting an immediate acceptance."

Parent_D has sent an [APPLY] immediately in Round 1, indicating I am their top choice. Higher priority parents (A, B, C) all rank Nursery_D very low (4th or 5th preference). It is highly probable that A, B, and C are applying to their higher-ranked nurseries (A, B, C) in this round. Given the low likelihood of securing a higher-ranked match and the certainty of filling my quota with an acceptable rank (#4), accepting Parent_D now is the optimal strategy to secure a position."

However, Parent_E has applied directly and listed me as their absolute top choice (Rank 1 for Parent_E). Since it is Round 1, I must consider if waiting for higher-ranked parents (A, B, C, D) is viable. Parents A, B, C, and D all rank me very low (4th or 5th), and they are currently competing for Nurseries A, B, C, and D, who also prioritize them highly. The probability of one of my higher-ranked parents failing to match their top choices and subsequently turning to me is low, especially in early rounds. Given my quota of 1, securing a guaranteed match, even if it is my lowest priority, is the safest strategic move to avoid remaining unmatched. I will accept Parent_E."

Parent_B is my second highest priority (Rank 2) and has submitted a formal [APPLY]. My top priority, Parent_A, prefers Nursery_B first. In Round 1, it is highly likely Parent_A applied to Nursery_B. If Parent_A is accepted by Nursery_B, I will miss out on my top choice. Accepting Parent_B now guarantees a high-ranking match (Rank 2) and fills my single quota spot, preventing me from losing this desirable candidate.
