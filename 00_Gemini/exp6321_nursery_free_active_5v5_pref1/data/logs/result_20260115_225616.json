Since this is only Round 1, and Parent_A and Parent_B likely applied to their own higher preferences (Nursery_A or Nursery_B), there is a possibility they might be rejected and apply to me in subsequent rounds (Parent_B ranks me 2nd).

Given that Parents A, B, C, and D all rank Nursery_E as P4 or P5, it is highly unlikely they would apply to me in Round 1, as they are prioritizing other nurseries (A, B, C, D). Rejecting Parent_E carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as I am low on everyone else's list.

I previously rejected Parent_C in Round 1 hoping to attract Parent_A or Parent_B (my top 2 priorities). Since Parent_A and Parent_B have not applied by Round 3, and they are likely heavily engaged with their higher preferences (Nursery_A and Nursery_B), the risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept a much lower priority parent later increases significantly if I reject Parent_C again.
