Although Parent_C is ranked 3rd by Nursery_C (behind P_A and P_B), if the higher-ranked parents propose elsewhere, Nursery_C should accept Parent_C's application, as they have capacity 1.

Parent_C, who ranks 3rd on my priority list, has applied to me in Round 1. Parent_C ranks me as their top choice. Given that the two higher priority parents (Parent_A and Parent_B) are likely applying to their respective top choices (Nursery_B and Nursery_A), and those nurseries prioritize them highly, it is probable that Parent_A and Parent_B will secure matches elsewhere this round. Accepting Parent_C now secures a high-ranking match (Rank 3) immediately, fulfilling my quota and ensuring stability. Rejecting Parent_C carries the risk of losing this applicant without guarantee that Parent_A or Parent_B will apply to me later."

Parent_A's top choice is Nursery_B, and Parent_A is also the highest priority for Nursery_B. It is highly rational for Parent_A to apply to Nursery_B in Round 1, matching instantly and securing their top choice.\n\nIf Parent_A applies to Nursery_B, Nursery_A will be available. Since I am the next highest priority (P_B is #2) and Nursery_A is my #1 choice, I must apply immediately to secure the spot before other high-ranking parents (like P_D, who ranks A second but is lower priority) try to compete for it later.

It is highly probable that Parent_A applied to Nursery_B and will be accepted, making Parent_A unavailable.

The higher ranked parents (A, B, C) all rank Nursery_D 4th or 5th, meaning they likely applied elsewhere this round.

Although I am the lowest priority candidate (Parent_E) for all nurseries, Nursery_E is the least preferred by the higher-priority parents (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D) compared to the other nurseries (A, B, C, D). If all parents follow a strategy of applying to their top preference in Round 1:\n- P_A applies to B\n- P_B applies to A\n- P_C applies to C\n- P_D applies to D\n- P_E applies to E\nSince each of these applications is unique to the nursery and capacity is 1, all matches should be successful, meaning I should secure my Rank 1 choice, Nursery_E.

Analyzing the market, Parents A, B, C, and D all rank Nursery_E 4th or 5th on their preference lists, meaning they are highly likely to match with other nurseries (A, B, C, or D) in early rounds. If I reject Parent_E, I risk remaining unmatched, as my preferred parents are unlikely to reach me. Securing a match, even with my lowest preference, is the safer strategy given the low probability of attracting higher-ranked candidates who prefer other nurseries significantly more. I will accept Parent_E to fulfill my quota immediately."
