The rejection reason suggests a strategic play by the nursery (perhaps waiting for a higher priority parent to become free, or simply preferring not to match with Parent_E, the lowest priority parent). Since all other parents are likely matched, Nursery_E must now choose between matching with Parent_E or remaining unmatched.\nI will re-submit a formal [APPLY], emphasizing my continued commitment and high preference, hoping that the Nursery, facing the prospect of remaining empty, will accept me."

I have applied to Nursery_E twice and been rejected both times, suggesting Nursery_E was holding out for a higher priority parent (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D). Given that we are in Round 3 and Nursery_E is still listed as unmatched, it is highly probable that all higher priority parents have now matched with their preferred nurseries (N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D).

Higher priority candidates (P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D) all rank Nursery_E last (5th) and are highly sought after by other nurseries (N_A, N_B, N_C, N_D) who also prioritize them highly. It is extremely unlikely that any higher-priority parent will apply to Nursery_E before they match elsewhere, as they have better options. Since I have rejected Parent_E twice, and they are still applying, they are the most certain match available.
