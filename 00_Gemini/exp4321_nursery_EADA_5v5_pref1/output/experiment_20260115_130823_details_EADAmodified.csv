Round 1 Applications:
- P_A applies to N_B
- P_B applies to N_A
- P_C applies to N_C

- P_E applies to N_E
Since each nursery receives only one application, all applications are accepted, resulting in the matching M = {(P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E)}. 

Parent_C is matched with Nursery_C, which is their Rank 1 choice. Since Parent_C achieves their highest possible preference, no strategic deviation can improve this outcome.

Step 1 (R1 Proposals using True Preferences):

Since all five parents apply to five distinct nurseries, all applications are immediately accepted (temporary admission). Part 1 ends here as no parents were rejected.

Temporary Matching M_T: (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E).

Part 2 (Blocking Parents Check):
Since no Parent was rejected due to competition in Part 1, the condition for 'Prevention' (causing other Parents to be rejected) is not met for any Parent. Therefore, there are no blocking Parents, and the matching M_T becomes the final matching M_F.

I must first simulate Part 1 assuming all parents submit their true preferences. 
Parent A's True Preference List (TPL) is [B, A, C, D, E].

Step 1: All parents apply to their Rank 1 choice. A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E.
Since Nursery A receives applications from B (Prio B) and A (Prio A), and A has higher priority, A is admitted to A. (Error check: Only B and A applied to A? No, B applied to A, A applied to B, C applied to C, D applied to D, E applied to E. No conflicts occurred in Step 1).
N_A admits B. N_B admits A. N_C admits C. N_D admits D. N_E admits E. 

Re-evaluating Step 1 based on TPLs:
Parent A (Prio A) applies to B.
Parent B (Prio B) applies to A.
Parent C (Prio C) applies to C.
Parent D (Prio D) applies to D.
Parent E (Prio E) applies to E.

Since all applications went to different nurseries, and all nurseries have a quota of 1, all parents are temporarily admitted immediately. 
Matching M1: (A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).

Since the matching stabilized in Step 1, no rejections occurred, and thus no parent had a temporary admission that differed from their final admission. Therefore, there are no 'blocking Parents' in Part 2. The final matching is M1.

1. Simulate the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences:
   - Round 1 Proposals:

     P_B -> N_A (My top choice)
     P_C -> N_C

2. Part 1 concludes immediately as everyone is matched and no rejections occurred.

3. Part 2 (Blocking Parents check): Since no parent was rejected at any step, the condition for a parent being 'blocking' (causing other parents to be rejected) is not met. The temporary admissions are final.

   Since Parent_E achieves the best possible outcome (Rank 1) by submitting true preferences, there is no incentive to deviate.

   Since the truthful submission leads to a full match in Round 1 without any temporary rejections, no parent meets the criteria for being a 'blocking parent' (a parent who moves after causing a rejection). Therefore, Part 2 does not alter the stable outcome achieved in Part 1.

Since P_A has dominant priority, they are guaranteed to secure their highest submitted choice, provided that choice has capacity (all capacities are 1).

This temporary admission will become final, as P_A will not be rejected from N_B.

1. Part 1 (DA): If Parent_B submits their true preference list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'], the resulting matching is determined in Round 1: P_A->N_B, P_B->N_A, P_C->N_C, P_D->N_D, P_E->N_E. Parent_B is matched with N_A (Rank 1).
2. Part 2 (Blocking Check): Since the matching stabilized immediately in Round 1 with no rejections or movements, there are no 'blocking Parents' found. The matching remains stable.

4. Part 2 Impact: Since no rejections occurred during Part 1, no Parent meets the criteria for being a 'blocking Parent' (which requires causing a rejection). Thus, Part 2 does not alter the stable outcome achieved in Part 1.

1. Initial Analysis (Assuming truthful submission by all):
   - Parent B's Rank 1 choice is Nursery_A.

P_A -> N_B, P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_C, P_D -> N_D, P_E -> N_E.
Since all nurseries receive exactly one application, the process ends immediately. The resulting match M1 is the final match: (B, A). Parent_B gets their Rank 1 choice (Nursery_A).

Since the matching stabilized immediately in Round 1, no Parent was ever rejected or moved from a temporary admission. Therefore, the conditions for a 'blocking Parent' (where temporary admission differs from final admission) are not met. Part 2 does not trigger a rerun.

Submitting the true preference list ensures the optimal outcome (Nursery_A) for Parent_B. Any misrepresentation risks matching with a lower-ranked school, as shown in the trace where misrepresenting led to Nursery_C (Rank 2). Thus, the dominant strategy is to submit the true preference list.",True,Nursery_A,True,True,1

Since all quotas are 1, Parent_A is guaranteed to be accepted by the first nursery they propose to, and they will never be rejected or displaced by another parent during Part 1 of the procedure.

The allocation mechanism is based on the Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1), followed by a check for 'blocking parents' (Part 2).

1. Analyze the DA outcome assuming truthful reporting:
If all parents submit their true preferences, in Round 1, every parent applies to their top choice, and since all nurseries have a quota of 1, and each nursery receives exactly one application:
- P_A -> N_B (Match)
- P_B -> N_A (Match)
- P_C -> N_C (Match)
- P_D -> N_D (Match)
- P_E -> N_E (Match)
The process ends immediately with Parent_D matched to Nursery_D (1st choice).

2. Check for Blocking Parents (Part 2):
Since the temporary admission in Round 1 for every parent equals their final admission, there is no discrepancy, and thus no parent qualifies as a 'blocking parent.' The matching M = {(A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)} is the final outcome.

A key property of P-DA is that submitting the true preference list is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing side (Parents). This means that a Parent cannot achieve a strictly better outcome by misreporting their preferences, regardless of what other Parents report.

First, I analyze the outcome assuming all parents submit their true preferences:
1. Round 1: All parents propose their 1st choice.
   - P_A -> B, P_B -> A, P_C -> C, P_D -> D, P_E -> E.
2. Since each nursery (quota=1) receives exactly one application, all applications are successful.
3. P_E is matched with Nursery_E (P_E's 1st choice).

Since Parent_E achieves their highest possible preference (1st choice) under truthful reporting, no manipulation can improve this outcome. The subsequent check for 'blocking parents' (Part 2) does not change the strategic incentive here, as the mechanism already resulted in the unique stable matching in Round 1, and no temporary admissions caused rejections that would trigger the blocking parent condition (Prevention condition is not met).

In the Parent-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) mechanism (Part 1), submitting true preferences is generally a weakly dominant strategy, particularly for the highest priority agent. Since Parent_A cannot be displaced once provisionally admitted, Parent_A is guaranteed to receive the highest ranked school on their submitted list that they apply to. By submitting their true preference list, Parent_A applies to their top choice, Nursery_B.

Execution of Part 1 with truthful preferences:
Step 1: P_A applies to B, P_B applies to A, P_C applies to C, P_D applies to D, P_E applies to E. All nurseries receive only one application (or P_A's application is successful if multiple applications occurred). All parents are provisionally admitted (P_A to B). The procedure ends immediately.

Parent_A is matched with Nursery_B, their #1 choice. This is the optimal outcome. 

Furthermore, since Parent_A's temporary admission (to B) immediately becomes their final admission, and no rejections occurred due to P_A's admission (as B only received P_A in Step 1), Parent_A cannot become a 'blocking Parent' in Part 2.

If Parent_B submits the true list ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'] (and assuming others submit theirs), the resulting stable matching $M_{DA}$ is: P_A -> N_B, P_B -> N_A, P_C -> N_C, P_D -> N_D, P_E -> N_E.

By analyzing the outcome if all parents submit their true preferences, the matching stabilizes in Round 1:
Parent_D proposes to Nursery_D (Rank 1). Since Nursery_D only receives one proposal (from D), D is temporarily admitted. All other parents also match with their Rank 1 choice immediately due to the specific combination of preferences and priorities.

Parent E's True Preference List: ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_D'].

1. Part 1 (DA Simulation with True Preferences):
   In Round 1, every parent applies to their Rank 1 choice:
   - P_A -> N_B
   - P_B -> N_A
   - P_C -> N_C
   - P_D -> N_D
   - P_E -> N_E
   Since all nurseries have a capacity of 1, and each nursery received exactly one application, all applications are accepted temporarily. The process ends in Round 1.
   The resulting allocation M1 is: (P_A, N_B), (P_B, N_A), (P_C, N_C), (P_D, N_D), (P_E, N_E).

2. Part 2 (Blocking Parent Check):
   A blocking parent occurs only if their temporary admission differed from their final admission (Discrepancy condition). Since the process ended in Round 1, the temporary admissions are the final admissions for all parents. Thus, no blocking parents are found.

3. Conclusion:
   Parent E is matched with Nursery E, which is their Rank 1 choice. Since this is the best possible outcome, Parent E should submit their true preferences.",True,Nursery_E,True,True,1

Since the allocation mechanism is based on the DA algorithm where parents are the proposing side, submitting the true preference list is the dominant strategy for Parent_A to achieve the best possible outcome (the Parent-optimal stable matching), regardless of the preferences submitted by other parents. The subsequent steps described in Part 2, which deal with 'blocking parents' and re-runs, are designed to refine the allocation or ensure stability based on intermediate temporary admissions, but they do not invalidate the strategy-proofness of the initial DA run for the proposing agents. 

If all agents submit their true preferences, the initial run of Part 1 yields:

- B proposes to A. A accepts (A > B, C, D, E).
- C proposes to C. C accepts.

Parent_B submits their true preference list: ['Nursery_A', 'Nursery_C', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_E', 'Nursery_D'].

Under the DA simulation (assuming all parents submit their true preferences):

Parent A -> Nursery B (Rank 1)
Parent B -> Nursery A (Rank 1)
Parent C -> Nursery C (Rank 1)
Parent D -> Nursery D (Rank 1)

Since all applications are unique to a nursery, all parents are temporarily admitted immediately:
A admitted by B, B admitted by A, C admitted by C, D admitted by D, E admitted by E.

2. Analyze Outcome:
   - Parent_D achieves a Rank 1 match (N_D), which is the best possible outcome.

3. Analyze Part 2 (Blocking Parents):
   - The 'blocking parent' rule requires a parent's temporary admission to have caused a rejection, followed by that parent moving away from that nursery later in Part 1. Since the matching stopped in Round 1 with no rejections caused by competition, no Parent meets the criteria for 'Prevention'. Part 2 is not triggered.

1. Strategy Proofness of DA: The DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (parents). Submitting true preferences typically guarantees the best stable outcome for the parent.
2. Dominant Priority: Because Parent_A has the highest priority everywhere, if they apply to a nursery (N_X), they will be temporarily admitted, and they will never be rejected later in Part 1, as no other parent has higher priority.
