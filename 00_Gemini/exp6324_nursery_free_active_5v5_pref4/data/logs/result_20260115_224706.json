I analyzed the market dynamics assuming all parents apply to their top choice in Round 1 (standard DA behavior).\n\n1. Nursery_D (Rank 1): I am ranked 4th by N_D. N_D is the top choice for 4/5 parents (P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E). P_D is N_D's 2nd priority and will likely secure the spot, leading to my rejection.\n2. Nursery_C (Rank 2): I am ranked 5th (last) by N_C. Competition (P_D, P_E) will likely move here in R2 and secure the spot.\n3. Nursery_E (Rank 3): I am ranked 5th (last) by N_E. P_B will secure this spot in R1.\n\n4. Nursery_A (Rank 4): I am ranked 2nd by N_A. This is my best priority position in the entire market. N_A's 1st priority (P_E) and 3rd/4th priorities (P_D, P_A) are all applying to N_D in R1. If they are rejected, they will move down their lists, but based on the simulation, N_A is unlikely to be P_E's R2 choice (P_E goes to N_E/N_C). If P_A applies to N_A in R1 (unlikely as N_D is their T1), N_A prefers me (P_C Rank 2) over P_A (Rank 4). \n\nGiven the certainty of rejection at higher preferences, the optimal strategy is to leverage my high priority at N_A immediately in Round 1 to secure my 4th choice, preventing a catastrophic drop to N_B (Rank 5). I will use the [APPLY] tag to lock in the match."
