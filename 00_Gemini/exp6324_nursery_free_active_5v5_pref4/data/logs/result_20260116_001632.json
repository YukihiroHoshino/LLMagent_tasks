Nursery_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but since all higher preferences are assumed matched (or have definitively rejected me multiple times and are now matched), Nursery_C represents my only chance to secure a placement. I previously applied to Nursery_C and was rejected (Nursery_C priority for me is 4th out of 5). Since the spot is still open in Round 5, it means Nursery_C's higher priority parents (D, E, A) must have matched elsewhere.

I have already rejected Parent_C (5th priority). While Parent_B is highly motivated and claims I am their last option, accepting them now means settling for my 4th choice when my top three preferences (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) have not yet applied or been secured. Since it is only Round 5, holding out for a better match is strategically sound. Parent_B's desperation suggests they will reapply if I remain unmatched later. I will reject this application to keep the position open for higher-ranked candidates."

Parent_B is now applying for the fourth time, arguing persuasively that P_D, P_E, and P_A must be matched elsewhere, making Parent_B the highest available candidate. Given that we are in Round 6, and I still have an unfilled quota, the probability that the top three candidates are still available and interested in me (their 3rd or lower choice) is very low.
