Parent_B is the next highest candidate on Nursery_C's priority list who might still be available (Parent_B is 4th priority, Parent_C is 5th).\n\nGiven that this is the last opportunity to secure a match, Parent_B must formally apply again and reiterate immediate commitment, hoping that Nursery_C has exhausted its higher-ranked options."

Therefore, I will reject Parent_B again."

I have previously rejected Parent_B three times and Parent_C once, holding out for higher priority parents (D, E, A). Parent_B argues that D, E, and A must be matched elsewhere, which is highly plausible given the late stage of the allocation process and the strong preference/priority matches those parents likely secured (e.g., Parent_D being top priority for Nursery_B). Since Parent_E and Parent_A have not contacted me despite my remaining quota, it is highly likely they are matched or pursuing other options. Rejecting Parent_B now carries a significant risk of leaving the quota unfilled, which is worse than matching with my 4th preferred parent. Therefore, securing the match with Parent_B is the optimal strategy at this stage."
