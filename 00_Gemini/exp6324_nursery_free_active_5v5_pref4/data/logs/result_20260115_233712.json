Based on simulation of standard greedy R1 applications (P_A, P_D, P_E applying to D; P_B applying to E), Nursery_A is likely to be ignored by its 1st priority parent (P_E) and 4th priority parent (P_A) in R1. By applying to Nursery_A immediately, I maximize my chance of securing my 4th choice, which is significantly better than the expected outcome of the stable match derived from pure deferred acceptance (my 5th choice, Nursery_B).

Parent_D (my P2) and Parent_A (my P1) are less likely to apply to me based on their preferences and other nurseries' priorities, but Parent_E is a strong possibility.
