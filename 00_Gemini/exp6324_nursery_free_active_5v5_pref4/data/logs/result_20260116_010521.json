Nursery_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but it is the only nursery currently listed as unmatched. I have already been rejected by my top 3 preferences (E, A, B). Since matching with any nursery on my list is preferable to remaining unmatched, I must apply to Nursery_C now, as this is likely the last available slot in the market. I will use the [APPLY] tag to signal immediate commitment."

While Parent_B is not my top choice, they are ranked higher than Parent_C (whom I previously rejected). My top three choices (D, E, A) are unlikely to apply to me soon, as they rank me 3rd or 5th, and their preferred nurseries rank them highly. Waiting carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as the market seems to be progressing. Accepting Parent_B secures a match, fulfilling my quota with the highest available applicant based on my true priority list in this round. I will accept Parent_B."
