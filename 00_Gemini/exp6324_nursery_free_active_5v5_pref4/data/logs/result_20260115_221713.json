The main competitor applying to E is Parent_B (1st choice E), who is 4th priority for E. Since I am 3rd priority for E, I outrank Parent_B. Applying to Nursery_E offers a high probability of acceptance for my second-highest preference.\n\n3. Nursery_C (3rd choice): I am 2nd priority. Parent_D (1st priority for C) is expected to apply to D.

Parent_E ranks me as their 2nd choice, indicating strong mutual interest. Since I have secured a high-priority match (3rd overall) who actively applied, and my top two choices are unavailable, accepting Parent_E immediately secures my quota and prevents the possibility of Parent_E matching elsewhere."
