The two parents ranked above me, Parent_A (Rank 1) and Parent_D (Rank 2), list Nursery_E as their 4th and 5th choice respectively. They are likely applying to Nursery_D (1st choice for both) or other higher preferences.\nParent_B lists Nursery_E as their 1st choice, but Parent_B is ranked 4th at Nursery_E.

However, checking priorities reveals I am 4th priority at D, behind P_D and P_E (who are also applying to D) and P_B (who is applying to E). If I apply to D, I calculate that I will be rejected and subsequently pushed down to my 5th choice, Nursery_B, in the final stable match.\n\nAlternatively, my 4th choice, Nursery_A, has me ranked 2nd in their priority list. In Round 1, A is the second, fourth, or fifth choice for all other parents, meaning it is highly likely to receive zero applications from parents with higher priority than me. By applying directly to Nursery_A in Round 1, I can secure my 4th choice immediately, which is strictly better than the 5th choice predicted by following the standard DA path.
