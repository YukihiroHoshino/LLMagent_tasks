However, since Nurseries A, B, D, and E are all matched, it is highly likely that the parents ranked above me by Nursery_C (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) have secured placements elsewhere (likely at their own higher preferences).\nThis significantly improves my priority standing at Nursery_C.

Since remaining unmatched is only preferred over matching with a nursery NOT on the list, and Nursery_C IS on the list, Parent_B must continue trying to match with Nursery_C.\nParent_B has applied and been rejected three times previously by Nursery_C. Nursery_C's priority list places Parent_B fourth out of five candidates. The fact that Nursery_C is still unmatched in Round 7 suggests that the higher priority parents (D, E, A) have either matched elsewhere or are refusing C. If they have matched elsewhere, Parent_B is likely the highest priority parent still actively seeking C.\nI need to send a fourth, definitive application, emphasizing the finality of the situation (Nursery_C being the last option) and immediate commitment, hoping to overcome the previous rejections based on Parent_B's relatively high priority among the remaining unmatched pool."
