Parent_B is applying with a strong commitment, indicating that their higher choices (Nursery E, A, B, D) have likely rejected them or filled their quotas. While Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A are ranked higher, they all listed Nursery_C as their 3rd or 5th choice. It is highly probable that P_D and P_E are already matched with their higher preferences (Nursery D or B/E). Given that we are in Round 4 and Parent_B offers a guaranteed, committed match, securing rank 4 is a prudent move to ensure the quota is filled, rather than risking being unmatched by holding out for parents who view C as a low preference."
