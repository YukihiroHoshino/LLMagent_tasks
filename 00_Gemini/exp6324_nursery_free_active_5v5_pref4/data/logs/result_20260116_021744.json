I have successfully rejected applications from Rank 4 (Parent_A) and Rank 5 (Parent_B) in previous rounds, demonstrating patience. While Parent_E (Rank 1) is still available, Parent_E ranks Nursery_A as their absolute last choice (5th), making it highly improbable they will apply unless they are rejected by four other nurseries. Securing Parent_C guarantees a very high-quality match immediately, fulfilling 80% of my optimization goal. The risk of waiting for Parent_E and potentially losing Parent_C is too high. I will accept Parent_C."

This suggests Nursery_C may be waiting for a higher-priority parent (D, E, or A) who is currently matched elsewhere but might become available, or prefers remaining unmatched over Parent_B. Given that this is the last opportunity for Parent_B to match, I must apply again.

Given that we are now in Round 6 and Parent_B is applying for the fourth time, declaring that they have exhausted all other options and are the only committed parent remaining, it is highly probable that Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A have successfully matched with their higher preferences (or other nurseries' higher priorities). Continuing to hold out carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as Parent_B is unlikely to find a better option and might eventually withdraw if rejected again, leaving me with an empty quota or only Parent_C (my last choice).
