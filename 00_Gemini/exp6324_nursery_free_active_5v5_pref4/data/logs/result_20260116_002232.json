Since P_D, P_E, and P_C are all ranked higher than me by N_D, applying here results in a certain rejection (N_D will accept P_D, who is ranked 2nd and applies P1).\n2. Nursery_A (P2): I am ranked 4th by N_A. However, N_A's top three preferences (P_E, P_C, P_D) all list N_D as their P1 choice. Assuming they follow a rational greedy strategy and apply to N_D, they will all be applying elsewhere in R1. If I apply to N_A, I will be the highest priority applicant N_A receives, securing a P2 match immediately.\n3. Nursery_B (P3): I am ranked 2nd by N_B. N_B's top preference is P_D, who is applying to N_D. If P_D gets N_D, I would secure N_B. This is a good fallback (P3), but N_A (P2) offers a higher utility if my prediction holds.\n\nStrategy: Deviate from P1 (N_D) and apply directly to P2 (N_A), capitalizing on the fact that N_A's higher priority candidates are competing fiercely for N_D.\n\nI will apply to Nursery_A to secure my 2nd choice immediately."
