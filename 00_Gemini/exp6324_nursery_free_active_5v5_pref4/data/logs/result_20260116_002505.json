I must prioritize Nursery_B.\nI have applied to Nursery_B twice and been rejected twice, despite being their 3rd ranked parent.

However, it is now Round 4, and neither Parent_D nor Parent_A have applied to me, suggesting they are likely engaged or matched with their higher preferences (Nursery_D or Nursery_A).\nParent_B is applying for the third time, explicitly stating this is their 'final' application and emphasizing their readiness to commit instantly. While Parent_B is Rank 3, securing a high-priority match now significantly reduces the risk of ending up unmatched, especially since the higher-ranked parents have not demonstrated interest. Given the high commitment level shown by Parent_B and the advancing stage of the market, accepting this highly ranked applicant is the strategically sound decision to secure my quota.\nDecision: ACCEPT Parent_B."

Parent_C is my lowest ranked candidate (Rank 5).\n\nI have rejected Parent_C for four rounds, attempting to secure a higher-ranked match. However, a market analysis confirms Parent_C's claim: Parents D, E, A, and B all had high preferences for other nurseries (N_D, N_B, N_E, N_A) and were prioritized highly by those nurseries (e.g., P_D and P_B were Rank 1 for N_B and N_D respectively; P_A was Rank 1 for N_E). It is highly probable they are all matched elsewhere by Round 5.\n\nParent_C is dedicated (Rank 2 preference for C) and is now applying for the fifth time. Since remaining unmatched is worse than matching with my lowest acceptable candidate, and there is virtually no chance of securing a higher-ranked parent at this stage, I must accept Parent_C to fulfill my quota and secure a match."
