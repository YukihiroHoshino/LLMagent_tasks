While Parent_B's message indicates they are running out of options, suggesting the market is tight, accepting my 4th choice now locks me out of matching with my top three choices (P_D, P_E, P_A).\n\nParent_D and Parent_E both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice. Since we are only in Round 4, there is a good chance that P_D and P_E have been rejected by their 1st and 2nd choices (Nursery_D, Nursery_E, Nursery_B) and might approach me soon. I prefer to hold out for a higher priority match (P_D, P_E, or P_A) rather than immediately settling for P_B, who ranks me last (5th). I will reject Parent_B to keep my quota open."

              "thought": "Nursery_C is the only remaining unmatched nursery, and Parent_B is currently unmatched. While Nursery_C is Parent_B's lowest preference (Rank 5), matching is preferred over remaining unmatched. Parent_B has previously applied to Nursery_C and was rejected (Round 4 or earlier). Since Nursery_C remains unmatched, it implies that all parents they preferred over Parent_B (Parent_D, E, A) must have matched elsewhere, or Nursery_C is being extremely selective. Given that Nursery_C's next preferred parent is Parent_C (Rank 5), and Parent_B is Rank 4 on their list, Nursery_C should logically prefer Parent_B to remaining empty. Parent_B must re-apply with a strong appeal, recognizing the previous rejection but emphasizing the mutual need to finalize a match."

We are in Round 5, and Parent_B is applying again, noting that I appear to be the only remaining available nursery. While Parent_B is not my top choice, their willingness to commit in this late stage, coupled with the high risk of remaining unmatched if I hold out for higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A) who have not yet applied, makes accepting this application prudent. The market seems highly saturated, and securing a match (even 4th preference) guarantees I fill my quota."
