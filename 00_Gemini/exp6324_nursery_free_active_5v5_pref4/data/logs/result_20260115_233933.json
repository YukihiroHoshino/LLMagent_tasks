Given that Nursery_D is the 1st choice for Parent_D, Parent_A, and Parent_C, competition is extremely high. Parent_D (2nd priority) is highly likely to apply there and secure the spot.\n\nMy 2nd choice is Nursery_E. At Nursery_E, I am 3rd priority (behind Parent_A and Parent_D). Parent_A and Parent_D are both targeting Nursery_D (their 1st choice), making it likely they will apply there first. The most likely competitor for Nursery_E in Round 1 is Parent_B (E is B's 1st choice), but Parent_B is 4th priority at Nursery_E.\n\nIf I apply to Nursery_E, I have a higher priority (3rd) than Parent_B (4th).

Parent_B is reapplying aggressively in Round 4, confirming strong commitment and identifying Nursery_B as their top remaining choice. Parent_D and Parent_A have not applied this round, suggesting they might be matched elsewhere or are pursuing higher preference options. Given that the market is progressing and I risk being unmatched if I wait too long for P1 or P2 who may never apply, securing a match with P3 now is the most rational decision to fulfill my quota of 1. Their reapplying shows high commitment, making them a reliable match."
