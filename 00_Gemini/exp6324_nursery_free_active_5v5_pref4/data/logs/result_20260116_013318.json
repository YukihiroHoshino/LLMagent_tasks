If A, D, and E all apply to D, Nursery_E will likely receive applications only from lower-priority parents (B and C). Since B is higher priority than C at E, applying immediately with [APPLY] gives Parent_B the best chance to secure their Rank 1 choice immediately in Round 1. If rejected, I still have options, though Nursery_D (Rank 4, Priority 1) might be taken."

While I prefer Parent_A, D, and E, waiting for them carries significant risk. Parent_A and Parent_D have me listed low on their preferences, making them unlikely candidates early on. Parent_E (Rank 3) is a strong possibility for Round 2, but accepting Parent_B now guarantees a highly committed match and fills my quota immediately. Since Parent_B is not my absolute lowest priority, and they have applied directly in Round 1, securing this match is the most prudent strategy."

They are highly likely to apply to their top choices (Nursery_D, E, B, C) in Round 1.\n\nAssuming rational competitors apply to their true top choice (P_C, P_D, P_E target D, P_B targets E), Nursery_A is likely to receive zero applications from parents ranked higher than me. Therefore, applying to Nursery_A maximizes my chances of securing my second-ranked preference in Round 1.\n\n3. Nursery_B (Rank 3): I am ranked 2nd by Nursery_B. Only P_D is ranked higher. Since P_D's #1 choice is D, they will likely apply there. If I apply to B, I am likely to get it, securing my 3rd choice. \n\nComparing A (Rank 2 preference, rank 4 priority) and B (Rank 3 preference, rank 2 priority): Since the competition for A is likely to be diverted to D/E, aiming for A yields a higher expected utility (Rank 2 match vs Rank 3 match).

Evaluate chances for Nursery_A: I applied in Round 1 and was rejected. Nursery_A ranks me 4th (behind P_E, P_C, P_D). It is unlikely I will be accepted unless three higher-priority parents have since matched elsewhere, which is possible but uncertain.\n4. Evaluate chances for Nursery_B: Nursery_B ranks me 2nd overall, behind Parent_D. Parent_D's top choice was Nursery_D. Since Nursery_D is likely matched (unavailable), Parent_D is probably matched elsewhere (or is out of the market).\n5. Conclusion: If Parent_D is matched, Parent_A becomes the highest priority applicant for Nursery_B.
