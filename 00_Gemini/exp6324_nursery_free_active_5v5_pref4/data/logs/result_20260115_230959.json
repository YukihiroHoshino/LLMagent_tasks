Although I have been rejected three times previously by Nursery_E (who ranks me 4th), it is highly likely that all parents ranked higher than me (Parent_A, Parent_D, Parent_E) have matched with their own higher preferences, leaving Nursery_E with no other choice if it wishes to fill its capacity. Since Nursery_E is my Rank 1 choice and the only remaining option, I must apply again, stressing the mutual necessity of the match at this late stage. Failing to apply means remaining unmatched, which is worse than matching with my Rank 1."

I have rejected Parent_B three times previously and also rejected Parent_C (ranked 5th). We are now in Round 5, and Parent_B claims I am the only remaining nursery seeking a match. Given the advanced stage of the allocation process, it is highly probable that my top three preferences (Parent_A, Parent_D, Parent_E) have been matched elsewhere, especially since they were highly prioritized by other nurseries (A, B, C, D). Parent_B is the highest-ranked remaining candidate applying to me. To secure my quota and avoid remaining unmatched, I must now accept Parent_B."
