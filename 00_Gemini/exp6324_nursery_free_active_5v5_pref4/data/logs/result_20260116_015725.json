This implies that all other nurseries (A, C, D, E) are matched, or at least they are not available for Parent_B.\n\nNursery_B is my 3rd choice, which is highly desirable.

It is now Round 4, and neither P1 nor P2 has applied to me, suggesting they are likely matched or pursuing their higher preferences (Nursery_D for both). Parent_B is reapplying and confirms I am their highest remaining preference, indicating strong commitment and stability.
