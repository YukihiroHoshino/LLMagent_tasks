My top choice is Nursery_D, but a quick analysis of R1 applications shows strong competition: P_A, P_D, P_E, and I are all applying there. Nursery_D prioritizes P_D (2nd rank) among these applicants, guaranteeing my rejection (I am 4th). \n\nMy second choice is Nursery_C. Nursery_C is the 5th choice for P_C, but crucially, it is the 3rd choice for P_D and P_E, and 5th for P_A and P_B. Since P_D, P_A, and P_E are applying to N_D (their 1st choice) and P_B is applying to N_E (their 1st choice) in R1, Nursery_C will likely receive zero applications besides mine if I choose to apply there.\n\nIf I apply to Nursery_D, I will be rejected and forced to compete in R2 for N_C against P_E (who ranks N_C highly, 3rd choice, and N_C ranks P_E 2nd). P_E would beat me for N_C (I am ranked 5th by N_C).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to bypass the guaranteed rejection at N_D and secure my 2nd preference, Nursery_C, immediately in Round 1 before P_E becomes available to apply there."

Parent_D (2nd priority) is likely matched with Nursery_D, removing them from competition at E.\n2. Parent_A (1st priority) lists E as their 4th choice. They are likely applying to D, A, or B first.

Since 4 rounds have passed since the first application to C, and C is still unmatched, it is highly likely that their higher priority candidates have matched elsewhere (as 4 other nurseries are matched).

My top 3 choices (D, E, A) likely matched with nurseries they preferred or who prioritized them higher, given the late stage of the simulation. Parent_B is offering 100% commitment and immediate acceptance, guaranteeing I fill my quota. Rejecting Parent_B carries a very high risk of remaining unmatched entirely.
