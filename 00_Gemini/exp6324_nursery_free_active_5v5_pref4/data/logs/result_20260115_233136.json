My preference rank is 2nd. Nursery_E's priority list is: P_A, P_D, P_E, P_B, P_C. I am 3rd priority.\n\nExpected Round 1 applications:\n1. P_A -> D (1st choice)\n2. P_D -> D (1st choice)\n3.

Nursery_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but it is the only remaining unmatched nursery. I have applied four times previously, emphasizing commitment and the 'final opportunity,' and was rejected every time. This indicates Nursery_C (which ranks Parent_B 4th) is holding out for one of its top three preferences (Parent_D, E, or A), or simply prefers remaining unmatched to matching with Parent_B at this stage.\n\nSince Nursery_C is still on my preference list, my objective remains to secure this spot rather than being unmatched. Repeating the emotional appeals has failed. The current situation is a complete deadlock: Parent_B needs C, and C is waiting for someone else. I will send a fifth, very brief, and purely transactional application, acknowledging the market reality and the need to conclude the process. Since the goal is allocation, the action must be [APPLY]."

My quota is 1 and I am currently unmatched. We are in Round 6, which suggests the market is nearing stability and most higher-ranked matches (P_D, P_E, P_A) are likely secured by other nurseries where they were higher priorities. Parent_B has repeatedly applied, indicating strong commitment and confirming that their preferred nurseries (N_E, N_A, N_B, N_D) are no longer options for them. While Parent_B is low on my list, accepting them secures a match (4th preference) rather than risking being unmatched or waiting for Parent_C (5th preference). Given the advanced round and Parent_B's definitive commitment, securing this match is the optimal strategy."
