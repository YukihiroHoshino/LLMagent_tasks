Given the likely market state, Parent_E (P2 priority for C) is the primary competition for Nursery_C, while Parent_C is P5 priority.\nAlthough success is highly unlikely, Parent_C must exhaust the P2 option before settling for P4 (Nursery_A). If Nursery_C matches Parent_E, Parent_C can then secure Nursery_A in the subsequent round, as Parent_C is P2 for Nursery_A, and Parent_E (P1 for A) will be matched.\nI will send a final, strong [APPLY] to Nursery_C to exhaust this high-preference option."
