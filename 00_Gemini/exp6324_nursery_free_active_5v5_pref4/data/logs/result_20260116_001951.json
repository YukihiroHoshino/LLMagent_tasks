However, Nursery_C is the only nursery remaining unmatched, while Nurseries A, B, D, and E have filled their quotas. This means all higher-ranked options for me are gone, and matching with C is strictly better than being unmatched.\n\nNursery_C has rejected me three times already, even when I stated the market was reaching its 'final stage.' Now, the market has truly reached its end game, as 4 out of 5 nurseries are matched. Nursery_C must now choose between the remaining unmatched parents (likely Parent_B and Parent_C) or remaining empty.\n\nNursery_C's priority list places Parent_B (Rank 4) above Parent_C (Rank 5). Since P_D, P_E, and P_A are matched elsewhere, Parent_B is now the highest priority parent available to Nursery_C.\n\nI must apply aggressively again, emphasizing the current critical market state and my superior ranking relative to any other remaining applicant, forcing Nursery_C to act rationally and secure a match."

I have repeatedly rejected Parent_B in previous rounds hoping for Parent_D, Parent_E, or Parent_A. Parent_B's current message strongly indicates that the market is essentially closed and that my top 3 choices are matched with other Nurseries (A, B, D, E). Given that I have 1 remaining quota and the risk of being unmatched is high if I reject Parent_B now, accepting the highest available parent (Rank 4) is the optimal strategy. I will accept Parent_B to secure the match."
