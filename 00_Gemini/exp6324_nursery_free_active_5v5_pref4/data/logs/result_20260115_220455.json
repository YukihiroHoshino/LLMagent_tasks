Parent_B's current message strongly indicates that all their higher preferences (Nursery_E, Nursery_A, Nursery_B, Nursery_D) are exhausted or matched, making Nursery_C their definitive final choice. Given that Nursery_C is the lowest preference for Parent_A, and only the third preference for Parent_D and Parent_E, the likelihood of those higher-ranked parents applying to me at this late stage (Round 6) is extremely low, especially if they have higher priority elsewhere. To avoid remaining unmatched, securing a committed applicant, even if they are Rank 4, is the optimal strategy at this point in the allocation process. I will accept Parent_B."
