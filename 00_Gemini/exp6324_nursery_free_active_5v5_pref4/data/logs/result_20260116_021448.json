Nursery_C is my lowest preference (Rank 5) but is the only remaining unmatched nursery. I have previously applied twice to Nursery_C and was rejected both times, indicating Nursery_C was holding out for higher priority parents (P_D, P_E, P_A). Given that we are in Round 5 and Nursery_C is the last remaining option, it is highly likely that its top priorities have matched elsewhere. To ensure I secure a match rather than remaining unmatched (which is worse than matching with Nursery_C), I must make a strong, final application. I need to convey absolute commitment to overcome the two previous rejections."

This is the fifth round, and I have rejected Parent_B three times previously while waiting for higher-ranked candidates (D, E, A) to apply. The continued persistence of Parent_B, despite being rejected multiple times and having me as their 5th choice, strongly suggests that Parent_B is unlikely to secure a spot at their preferred Nurseries (E, A, B, D) and is highly committed to filling my quota. Given the advanced stage of the allocation process (Round 5) and the risk of my top three priorities matching elsewhere, accepting Parent_B (Rank 4) is a prudent move to secure a match and fulfill my quota (1) rather than risking remaining unfilled or settling for Rank 5 (Parent_C). I will accept this commitment."
