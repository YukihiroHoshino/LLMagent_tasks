Parent_B has already applied once and was rejected, and is now reapplying, indicating they are highly motivated to match with Nursery_C, which means they might apply again if rejected now, or they will secure a match elsewhere, which is acceptable since they are low priority.

Given that I have consistently rejected P_B previously to hold out for higher priority parents, and P_D/P_E/P_A all ranked N_C 3rd or higher (except P_A, who is 5th but still higher priority for me than P_B), I believe there is still a marginal chance for a higher-ranked parent to apply in the next round.
