I still have my full quota of 1. Although Parent_C is persistent and claims I am their highest remaining priority, accepting them now locks me out of matching with Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, or Parent_B, all of whom I prefer. Since it is still relatively early (Round 4), and my top targets (Parent_D and Parent_E) rank me 3rd, there is a chance they might approach me if their top choices are filled. I have previously rejected Parent_C twice. I will maintain my strategy and reject Parent_C again to keep my quota open for a higher-ranked applicant."

This implies that Nursery_A and Nursery_E, although not interacted with by Parent_C, are also matched.\n4. If Nursery_C is the only unmatched nursery, and all other nurseries (A, B, D, E) are matched, it is highly likely that all parents ranked higher than Parent_C on Nursery_C's priority list (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B) have secured placements at those other nurseries.\n5. Nursery_C's Priority List: D > E > A > B > C. If D, E, A, and B are matched elsewhere, Parent_C is now the highest available priority candidate for Nursery_C.\n6. Parent_C has applied twice already and was rejected. Given the current market state (Round 5, N_C is the last remaining spot), Nursery_C must accept Parent_C to match. Parent_C should apply strongly, leveraging this information to pressure for immediate acceptance."

Parent_C argues convincingly that the market has thinned, and all parents ranked higher than them on my list have likely matched elsewhere, making them my highest available candidate.\nIf I reject Parent_C now, I risk remaining unmatched, as the higher priority parents (P_A, P_B) rank me last on their lists (Rank 5), and P_D/P_E rank me 3rd. If they haven't applied by Round 5, it's highly probable they secured matches at N_D, N_E, N_A, or N_B.\nTo secure a stable match and fulfill my quota, accepting my rank 5 applicant at this late stage is the rational decision, especially since they are eager to commit."
