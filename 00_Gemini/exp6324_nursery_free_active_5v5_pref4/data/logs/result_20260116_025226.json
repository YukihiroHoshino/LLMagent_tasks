While I ideally prefer Parent_D or Parent_E, we are in Round 4, and Parent_A has formally applied and stated that Nursery C is now their 'absolute priority.' This indicates high commitment from Parent_A, despite C being their 5th choice initially. Waiting risks losing Parent_A while hoping Parent_D or Parent_E materialize, who might have already matched with their higher preferences (Nursery D, Nursery B, Nursery E). Securing a match with my 3rd preference is a strong outcome and minimizes risk in a dynamic environment. I will accept Parent_A."
