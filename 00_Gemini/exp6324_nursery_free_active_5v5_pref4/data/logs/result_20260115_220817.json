After careful consideration of our remaining applications and priorities, we are pleased to offer you the final available placement at Nursery C. We look forward to welcoming your family.",
              "thought": "I am Nursery_C with 1 remaining quota. My priority list is ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C']. Parent_B is my 4th preferred parent. We are in Round 4, and Parent_B has sent a formal [APPLY]. My higher priority parents (P_D, P_E, P_A) are all highly ranked by other nurseries (N_D, N_E, N_A, N_B) and are likely matched by now. For instance, Parent_D is the top choice for Nursery_B and the second choice for Nursery_D. Parent_A is the top choice for Nursery_E. Given the late stage of the negotiation (Round 4), securing a match at rank 4 is a prudent decision to avoid remaining unmatched, as the likelihood of higher-ranked parents applying to Nursery_C (their 3rd or 5th choice) is significantly diminished."
