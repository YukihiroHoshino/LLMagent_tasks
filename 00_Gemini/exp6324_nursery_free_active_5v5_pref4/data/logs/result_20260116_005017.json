While persistence is noted, Parent_C is ranked 5th (last) on my True Priority List. My quota is 1. Accepting Parent_C now would prevent me from matching with Parent_D (Rank 1) or Parent_E (Rank 2), who are likely still pursuing their own higher preferences (Nursery_D, Nursery_B, Nursery_E). Since it is only Round 4 and I have not yet heard from my top 4 candidates, I must hold out for a higher priority match to maximize my objective. I will reject Parent_C again."

As the only remaining available nursery on our highly valued preference list, Nursery C is now our absolute and only focus.

All other nurseries are implicitly matched, leaving Nursery_C as the only available option. Although Nursery_C has rejected me twice (likely because I am ranked last on their priority list), the market dynamics have changed: if Nursery_C is the only unmatched nursery, it means all parents ranked higher than me (P_D, P_E, P_A, P_B) must have matched elsewhere. Therefore, I am now the highest available candidate for Nursery_C. I must apply aggressively for the third and final time, emphasizing that I am the last remaining viable match for their capacity."

              "thought": "Nursery_C's goal is to maximize priority rank, but securing a match is essential (Quota=1). Parent_C is rank 5 (last) on my priority list. I have rejected Parent_C twice previously, hoping for higher-ranked parents (D, E, A, B) to apply. Parent_C's persistent application and claim that Nursery_C is the 'sole unmatched nursery' strongly suggest that the market is closing and higher-ranked parents are likely matched elsewhere (especially since D and E rank C as their 3rd choice and haven't applied yet). If D and E are matched, and A and B rank C as their 5th choice, Parent_C (ranking C as 2nd preference) is the most motivated and likely available candidate. At Round 5, the risk of remaining unmatched by waiting further for higher-ranked parents who have shown no interest is too high. I will secure the match now with Parent_C."
