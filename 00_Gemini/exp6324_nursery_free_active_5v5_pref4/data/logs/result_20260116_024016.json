Checking Nursery_A's priority list, Parent_C is ranked 2nd ('Parent_E', 'Parent_C', ...). This is a very strong position. I should immediately submit a formal application ([APPLY]) to maximize the chance of securing this match before Parent_E potentially applies or is accepted elsewhere."

Parent_C is ranked #2 on my priority list: ['Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B']. I previously rejected lower priority Parents (A and B) to hold out for C, D, or E.\r\nParent_C has now submitted a formal [APPLY]. While Parent_E is my #1 choice, they rank me last (5th) on their preference list, making it unlikely they will apply soon, especially in Round 4. Parent_C's commitment at rank #2 is extremely valuable. Accepting Parent_C maximizes my utility given the current commitment and the low probability of securing Parent_E or Parent_D before they match elsewhere. I will accept Parent_C to secure a high-quality match and fill my quota."
