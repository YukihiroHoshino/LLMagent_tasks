Nursery_C is my last choice (Rank 5), but it is the only remaining available nursery. All other nurseries (A, B, D, E) must be matched, and all other parents (A, C, D, E) must have secured spots, as there are 5 parents and 5 nurseries, and only Nursery_C remains unmatched.\n\nNursery_C's priority list is ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C']. Since Parents D, E, and A must have matched elsewhere (likely their preferred choices, as the market usually clears high-priority applicants first), Parent_B is now the highest available candidate for Nursery_C.\n\nI have applied four times previously and been rejected, likely because the higher-priority parents (D, E, A) were still holding out or being considered. Now that the market has fully settled and only Nursery_C remains, I must secure this spot to avoid being unmatched. I will send a final, definitive [APPLY] message emphasizing immediate acceptance and the conclusion of the allocation process."

I have rejected Parent_B multiple times previously, hoping for a higher-ranked match (P_D, P_E, P_A). Parent_B is now applying for the fifth time, explicitly stating that the market has cleared and they are the highest-ranked available parent remaining on my list. Given that we are in Round 6 and I still have an unfilled quota, it is highly probable that P_D, P_E, and P_A have matched elsewhere, making P_B the best possible match available. Rejecting P_B now risks ending up with P_C (Rank 5) or remaining unmatched. I should accept the highly committed Parent_B to secure a match at Rank 4."
