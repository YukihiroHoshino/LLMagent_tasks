Parent D is ranked 2nd by Nursery_D and has D as their 1st choice, making a match between P_D and N_D highly probable. Applying to D would result in a guaranteed rejection, pushing me to R2.\n\nMy second preference is Nursery_A. Nursery_A ranks me 4th. Crucially, in Round 1, all parents ranked higher than me by Nursery_A (P_E, P_C, P_D) are proposing to Nursery_D. Since Nursery_A will receive no higher-priority applicants in R1, and securing a match is vital in this environment (capacity 1), Nursery_A is likely to accept my application to secure a reasonably high-ranked parent (4th). This allows me to secure my 2nd choice immediately, which is much better than risking being pushed down to my 3rd choice (Nursery_B) if Nursery_A decides to reject me hoping for P_E/P_C in R2, who are likely to target Nursery_C instead.\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to apply directly to Nursery_A to secure my 2nd choice."

Since Parent_D (Rank 1) and Parent_E (Rank 2) both rank Nursery_C as their 3rd choice, and we are only in Round 5, there is a reasonable expectation that they might apply if their preferred options (N_D, N_B, N_E) reject them.
