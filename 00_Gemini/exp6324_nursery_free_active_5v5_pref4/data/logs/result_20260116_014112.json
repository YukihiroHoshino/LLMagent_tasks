Since the list of unmatched nurseries only includes ['Nursery_C'], this implies that Nursery_D (my 4th choice) is already matched.\nTherefore, Nursery_C is the last remaining nursery on my preference list. To avoid being unmatched, I must apply now.\nNursery_C's priority list places Parent_B fourth ('Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C'). Since Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A are highly likely matched elsewhere (as D, E, A, B are matched), Parent_B has a strong chance of being accepted by Nursery_C.\nI will formally apply ([APPLY]) to secure this final available spot."

Parent_B has applied with high commitment, stating that Nursery_C is their final remaining option, indicating they have failed to match with their higher preferences (N_E, N_A, N_B, N_D). While I prefer Parent_D, Parent_E, and Parent_A, the high likelihood that these parents are either matched or pursuing stronger options elsewhere (where they are highly prioritized) suggests that holding out significantly increases the risk of remaining unmatched, or settling for Parent_C (Rank 5). Since Parent_B is ready to commit immediately and is a reasonable rank (4th), securing this match is a safe and positive outcome in Round 4. I will accept Parent_B."
