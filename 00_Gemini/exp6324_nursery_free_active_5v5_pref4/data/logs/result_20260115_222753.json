Nursery_C: Although my 2nd preference, I was already formally rejected in a previous round. While they are still unmatched, reapplying immediately is low probability of success given my low priority ranking (5th) with them.\n\n2. Nursery_A: This is my 4th preference, but crucially, Nursery_A ranks Parent_C as their 2nd priority ('Parent_E', 'Parent_C', ...). Since Parent_E (Nursery_A's top choice) is likely matched elsewhere (Nursery_E is unavailable), Parent_C is potentially Nursery_A's best available candidate.\n\nTo maximize the chance of matching and securing a spot quickly, I should prioritize the high-probability match, Nursery_A, even though it is my 4th preference. I will use the [APPLY] tag to signal commitment and try to close the deal immediately."
