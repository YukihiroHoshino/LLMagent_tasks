Analyzing the market, Nurseries A, B, C, and D are likely to be heavily contested by other parents (especially Nursery_D, which is the top choice for P_A, P_C, P_D, and P_E). By proposing to Nursery_E early, where Parent_B is ranked 4th, I capitalize on the likely congestion elsewhere and aim to secure my Rank 1 preference."

While I prefer Parents A, D, and E, the likelihood of them applying to me in Round 1 is low, as they all prefer other nurseries highly (especially Parent_D, who ranks me 5th). Accepting Parent_B guarantees a highly motivated and secure match.
