My priority rank at Nursery_C is 4th ('Parent_B' is after D, E, A), which is weak. However, given that A, B, D, and E are likely matched or otherwise unavailable, there is a strong chance that the three parents ranked above me (D, E, A) have already found matches elsewhere, making Nursery_C available to me.\nI will submit a formal [APPLY] to secure the match."

All other parents must be matched, making Parent_B the only available parent, or at least the highest priority available parent for C (C's priority list: P_D, P_E, P_A, P_B, P_C. If P_D, P_E, P_A are matched elsewhere, P_B is the top remaining choice).\nI must send a decisive [APPLY] message, acknowledging the previous rejection but emphasizing absolute commitment now that this is the final opportunity."

However, accepting Parent_B (4th priority) means foregoing any chance of matching with Parent_D (1st), Parent_E (2nd), or Parent_A (3rd).\n\nSince it is still only Round 5, and I have three higher-ranked parents who have not yet applied (or haven't been accepted yet by their top choices), I maintain my strategy of holding out. The market signals suggest that higher-ranked parents might be forced to apply to their lower choices soon, which includes me.

Since Nursery_C is the only one left, it is highly likely that their top three preferences (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) have matched elsewhere.
