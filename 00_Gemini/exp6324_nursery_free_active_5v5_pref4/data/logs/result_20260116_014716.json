My preference list is ['Nursery_E', 'Nursery_A', 'Nursery_B', 'Nursery_D', 'Nursery_C'].\nAvailable nurseries are Nursery_A (#2 preference) and Nursery_C (#5 preference).\nNursery_A is my highest remaining choice. Despite applying seven times and being rejected due to being the lowest priority on their list, Nursery_A is still unmatched in Round 8. This strongly implies that all four parents ranked higher than me (E, C, D, A) are either matched elsewhere or have definitively stopped pursuing Nursery_A. \nAlthough Nursery_A has been extremely rigid, the current situation dictates that Parent_B is likely their best, and perhaps only, remaining applicant. I must make a final, forceful application, leveraging the late stage of the process to secure my second-highest preference before settling for my lowest preference (Nursery_C), which also rejected me recently."
