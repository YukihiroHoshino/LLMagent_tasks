This implies that Nurseries A, B, D, and E have all filled their quota of 1, or that I must treat them as unavailable.\n3. Strategy: Since Nursery_C is the only remaining option, I must secure this placement, despite it being my lowest preference (Rank 5) and having previously rejected me.\n4. Nursery_C's perspective: Nursery_C ranks Parent_B fourth (after D, E, A). If D, E, and A are all matched elsewhere (which is likely if C is the only one left unmatched), Parent_B is now the highest available candidate for C. I must re-apply forcefully.\n5.

Given that the market is now almost entirely cleared, it is highly likely that the higher priority parents Nursery_C was waiting for (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) are now matched elsewhere.\nMy strategy is to make one final, definitive application, emphasizing that this is a non-negotiable acceptance and that I am ready to commit immediately.

While I held out in earlier rounds, rejecting Parent_B now carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, which is worse than accepting a 4th choice.
