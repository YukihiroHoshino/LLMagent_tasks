Parent_E is applying to D (P1) and will likely be rejected and move to E (P2) or C (P3) in subsequent rounds.\n3. Preventing loss of P4: If Parent_C follows the standard DA path (applying to D in R1, getting rejected), Parent_A will apply to A in R2 (A is P_A's P2 choice). Although P_C is preferred over P_A at A, securing the spot immediately in R1 guarantees P4, which is significantly better than the expected P5 outcome derived from following sequential DA (where P_A takes A in R2).\n\nTherefore, the optimal strategy is to secure the highest reliable option immediately: Nursery_A."
