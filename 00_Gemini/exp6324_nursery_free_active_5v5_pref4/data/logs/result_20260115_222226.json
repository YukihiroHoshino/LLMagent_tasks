This likely happened because higher-priority parents (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A, Parent_B, as per Nursery_C's priority list) were applying or were provisionally held.\nSince 4 out of 5 nurseries have matched, it is highly probable that all parents ranked higher than me by Nursery_C have secured matches elsewhere (or are no longer pursuing C).\nGiven that Nursery_C is still available and is a high preference for me, I must apply again with a strong commitment, assuming I am now the highest available candidate for them, even though I am their lowest priority overall (P5).\nI will use the [APPLY] tag to formally attempt to secure the match."
