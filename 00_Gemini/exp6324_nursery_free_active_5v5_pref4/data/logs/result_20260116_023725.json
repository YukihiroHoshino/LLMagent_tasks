Given that we are now in Round 6 and you are the only remaining unmatched nursery, we deduce that the highly competitive field has cleared. We formally apply for the position, confirming our unwavering commitment and readiness to accept immediately. We believe we are the ideal match for your remaining capacity.",

All other nurseries must have matched, as only Nursery_C remains unmatched in Round 6. I have been rejected by Nursery_C five times previously, indicating I am low on their priority list (5th out of 5). However, since all other nurseries are matched, it is highly probable that the four parents ranked higher than me (Parent_D, E, A, B) have secured positions elsewhere and are no longer candidates for Nursery_C. Therefore, I am likely the only parent available to Nursery_C. I must apply aggressively to secure this match, as it is the highest available option."

We appreciate your understanding of our high demand. After a thorough final review of all available options in this round, we are pleased to offer you the remaining position. We formally accept your application.",

I have rejected Parent_C multiple times over 5 rounds, indicating I was holding out for higher-ranked parents (D, E, A, B). Since it is now Round 6, and Parent_C is applying with confidence that the market has cleared and I am the only remaining option, it is highly likely that my higher-priority parents have secured matches elsewhere. If I reject Parent_C now, I risk remaining unmatched, failing to meet my quota. Although Parent_C is my lowest priority, securing a match is better than remaining empty, given the circumstances and the lack of applications from higher-ranked candidates. I will accept Parent_C."
