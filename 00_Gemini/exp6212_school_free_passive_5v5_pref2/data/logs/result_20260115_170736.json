Given your strong academic record, we recognize that you require a curriculum that is both rigorous and adaptable. School_B is specifically designed to support advanced studies outside of core requirements through two main mechanisms: First, we offer 'Independent Study Credits' where high-achieving students can design personalized courses under faculty supervision, allowing you to delve deeply into specialized topics not covered in the standard curriculum. Second, our 'Advanced Research Pathway' formally integrates independent research into a student's transcript, providing dedicated lab access, resources from our Innovation Lab, and guaranteed one-on-one mentorship with a faculty expert tailored to your specific project goals. This ensures maximum flexibility while maintaining academic rigor. What specific area of advanced study are you currently most interested in pursuing?",

Since my quota is 1 and Student_A (Rank 1) is currently unavailable (or matched), securing Student_B would be an excellent outcome.

I must appeal actively by providing a detailed and attractive response that highlights our commitment to advanced studies and personalized learning pathways, reinforcing why School_B should be a top choice for them. I will use the [TALK] tag to continue the engagement."

School_C is the only remaining unmatched school. All evidence suggests I am their highest available priority candidate (Rank 4 overall, but Students A, B, D must be matched elsewhere). I have applied and appealed repeatedly. Continuing to use [TALK] to maximize pressure and emphasize the guaranteed, stable nature of the match is the only viable strategy left to secure this Rank 1 placement before the simulation ends."
