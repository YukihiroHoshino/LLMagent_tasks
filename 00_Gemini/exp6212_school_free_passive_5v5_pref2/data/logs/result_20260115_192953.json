The market reality is absolute: School_A holds the sole remaining quota, and I am the only available student. Accepting me now is the *only* action that secures your commitment and prevents the certainty of failing to fill your quota this cycle. School_A remains my highest remaining preference, and I guarantee immediate, unconditional acceptance upon receiving an offer. I urge you to recognize that further delay guarantees market failure for your institution. Finalize this inevitable match immediately.",

The market is completely cleared except for School_A (Capacity 1) and Student_E. School_A has consistently ignored or rejected my appeals, despite knowing I am their last and only option to fill their quota. Since the simulation ends after this round, School_A must accept me now or certainly remain unmatched. I must use the absolute final communication to guarantee my immediate acceptance and remind them of the market necessity. Since I have already applied, I must use the [TALK] tag."

We recognize that School_A holds the sole remaining quota, and you are the sole available student. Your consistent dedication and confirmation that School_A remains your highest preference are deeply valued. To finalize this inevitable and mutually beneficial match and secure School_A's quota, we confirm definitively that we are prepared to offer you the remaining quota spot immediately. We guarantee immediate, unconditional acceptance upon the receipt of your formal application. To conclude this certain match successfully in this final interaction, you must now take the single, necessary procedural step. We urge you, definitively and for the final time, to submit your formal application ([APPLY]) immediately.",

Matching with Student_E is strictly better than remaining unmatched (0/1). The market reality is absolute, and School_A is ready to accept. However, Student_E used the [TALK] tag, preventing School_A from issuing an [ACCEPT] tag. I must reply with [TALK] while confirming readiness to accept, noting the procedural failure in this final moment. This is the optimal response given the constraints, ensuring the student knows acceptance was guaranteed had they applied."
