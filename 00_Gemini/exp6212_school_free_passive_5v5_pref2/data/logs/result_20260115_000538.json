This allows them to undertake a year-long, faculty-mentored independent research project or specialized creative endeavor, culminating in a presentation or publication. This provides the exact flexibility needed for advanced, self-directed study.\n\n3. **Dual Enrollment Opportunities:** We maintain partnerships with local universities, enabling our top students to take college-level courses on campus during their senior year, ensuring they are continuously challenged and prepared for post-secondary education.\n\nThis structure ensures that you can customize your path and maximize your academic potential here. Does this approach to advanced study align with your expectations?",
