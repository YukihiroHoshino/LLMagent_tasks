Our student support and counseling services are fully integrated into our academic advising process, starting from day one. We operate on a four-year advisement model where each student is assigned a dedicated College Counselor (separate from their academic advisor) starting in 9th grade. These counselors meet regularly with students and parents to build a personalized academic trajectory that aligns with university goals. Specifically for university applications, our counselors work closely with academic departments to ensure transcripts and recommendations accurately reflect the student's achievements and potential. We run workshops, mock interview sessions, and essay clinics, ensuring seamless support from course selection to final application submission. This holistic approach ensures academic choices are always viewed through the lens of future university success. Does this structure meet your expectations for comprehensive support?",
