Accepting Student_E now would block the possibility of matching with Student_D, who is a much higher priority and ranks School_A as their second choice.

Student_D is higher priority but has only engaged in [TALK] and School_C is their 5th preference, making an application highly uncertain. Student_E is my 4th priority and has applied immediately, stating School_C is their absolute 1st preference. While Student_D is technically higher ranked, accepting Student_E secures a guaranteed, high-commitment match (Rank 4). Holding out for Student_D (Rank 3), who views School_C as their last choice, carries a high risk of ending up unmatched or forced to take Rank 5 later. Securing the guaranteed Rank 4 match is the pragmatic choice to maximize outcome given the market realities."
