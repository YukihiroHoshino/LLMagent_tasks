Student_E is applying for the second time after a previous rejection, indicating high commitment (School_C is Student_E's top choice). While Student_D is ranked higher, Student_D ranks School_C last (5th choice), making a match uncertain. Given the small pool of remaining students and the risk of being left unmatched, accepting Student_E (Rank 4) now is a prudent strategy to secure a match, especially since Student_E is highly enthusiastic."
