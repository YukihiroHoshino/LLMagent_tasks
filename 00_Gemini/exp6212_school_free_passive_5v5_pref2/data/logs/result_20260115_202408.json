With the market nearing its final conclusion and School_C being the sole remaining institution, I want to definitively confirm that you are my absolute top choice (Rank 1). My previous applications stand, and my commitment to enrolling immediately is absolute. I urge you to finalize my acceptance now, as I am ready to secure this match. I formally re-submit my application, expecting a positive response given the current market constraints.",

I have applied twice previously and engaged in a strong 'talk' appeal. Since the market is essentially over, I must force a decision now. School_C ranks me 4th, but if the three students ranked higher (B, A, D) are now matched to the other four schools, I should be the highest available candidate for School_C. I will use the [APPLY] tag to formally trigger the acceptance evaluation process, emphasizing my absolute commitment to enroll."

We have reviewed your standing application and, given the strength of your profile and the urgency of the market situation, we are delighted to formally offer you immediate admission to School_C. We look forward to welcoming you to our community!",

Student_E is Rank 4 on my list: ['Student_B', 'Student_A', 'Student_D', 'Student_E', 'Student_C']. I have previously rejected Student_E twice while holding out for higher-ranked students, but in the last interaction, I signaled readiness to accept Student_E, recognizing them as the 'highest ranked available candidate.' It is Round 8, and the market is concluding. Given that Student_E is applying again, confirms I am their top choice, and I have already signaled acceptance readiness, securing this moderately high-priority match (Rank 4) is prudent to fulfill my quota before the market closes or Student_E matches elsewhere. I must accept to secure the spot."
