My commitment is driven by the conviction that School_E is the perfect environment for my success.

I have already applied previously and repeatedly expressed absolute commitment, despite being School_E's lowest priority (P5). Since we are in Round 12 and School_E is still unmatched, they are likely holding out for a higher-priority student. However, given the late stage of the market, I must use this opportunity to offer immediate, guaranteed acceptance, stressing the urgency and the mutual benefit of finalizing the match now. I must use [TALK] as I have already formally applied."

While they have demonstrated extreme persistence and absolute commitment, I must prioritize my higher-ranked students (E, B, A, D). Since Student_C sent a [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]. I have been actively encouraging C to apply in previous rounds, but since they keep sending [TALK] confirmations instead of [APPLY], I will continue to praise their dedication while holding off on any definitive commitment, preserving my quota for higher-ranked students who may still be available. I need to maintain their interest until the very last moment, in case they are my only option."

School_E is still unmatched in Round 13, suggesting their higher-priority candidates have either matched elsewhere or been rejected.
