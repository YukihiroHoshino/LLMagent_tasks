We fully concur that the selection phase is definitively over, and the outcome confirms your standing as the highly suitable, guaranteed choice for our remaining quota. Our final admissions review is complete. We confirm, unequivocally, that we are prepared to immediately extend the offer to you. We await your formal application to finalize this guaranteed match and successfully conclude the process.",

Student_C is School_C's lowest priority (Rank 5) but is still on the list. All higher-priority candidates are confirmed matched elsewhere. To fulfill the quota, School_C must match with Student_C. However, Student_C used the [TALK] tag, preventing an immediate [ACCEPT]. I must use the final [TALK] message to confirm absolute readiness to accept immediately upon receiving the [APPLY] tag, thereby concluding the extensive negotiation and securing the match if Student_C applies in a hypothetical subsequent step (though this is the final round). Since the user only asked for the reply to the current message, and the current message is [TALK], the reply must also be [TALK]."
