School_E is my lowest preference (Rank 5), but it is still on my list. The current situation indicates that School_E is the only high school remaining unmatched. If A, B, C, and D are matched, School_E is my only remaining option to secure a match, and I prefer matching with E over being unmatched. Furthermore, School_E ranks me (Student_E) as their absolute top priority. Given that School_E is unmatched and I am their top choice, applying now guarantees a match. I previously sent a [TALK] message, so now I will formally apply."
