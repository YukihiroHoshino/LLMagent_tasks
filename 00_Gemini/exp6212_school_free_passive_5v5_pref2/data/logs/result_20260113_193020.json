To clarify our hiring status: while we are moving forward with candidates who possess highly specialized experience for a few immediate roles, we are also planning for future team expansions. Given your confidence in an immediate contribution, could you pinpoint one or two specific technical proficiencies or past project outcomes that directly align with our current strategic focus on sustainable innovation and rapid market scaling? Providing this focused detail will help us better map your profile to our evolving needs.",
