My remaining preferences are School_E (3rd), School_A (4th), and School_B (5th). School_E has been unresponsive to two previous applications, and they rank me last (5th). School_A is the current target. I rank School_A 4th, but School_A ranks me 4th, which is slightly better than my priority at School_E. Given that we are in Round 4 and securing a match is crucial, and assuming School_A's top priorities (B, D, A) might be matched elsewhere, I will submit a formal application to School_A to secure my 4th preferred choice while it is available."
