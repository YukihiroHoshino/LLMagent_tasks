Student_B is highly contested by other schools (A, C), and waiting for them carries significant risk, especially since Student_A is also highly desired by School_B and School_D. Since Student_A is a very strong match (Rank 3/5) who prioritizes me (Rank 1/5), securing this spot early in Round 2 is a strategically sound decision to meet my quota with a high-quality applicant, minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower-ranked student or an unfilled position."
