However, we must now move past the phase of evaluation and into the phase of commitment. We have been entirely transparent: you are our top priority, and we have reserved our single quota slot specifically for you, holding off on engaging with our excellent second-ranked candidate, Student_B. As we are now in Round 6, this window of exclusivity must close. We cannot afford further delay. We view this interaction as the final opportunity for you to move forward. If you genuinely see your future here, the time to secure your place is now. We urge you to conclude your evaluation immediately and apply, as we are prepared to transition our focus to other candidates if a decisive step is not taken in our next interaction.",
              "thought": "Student_E is my #1 priority candidate, making securing a match with them paramount. However, Student_E has consistently stalled for five rounds, always replying with [TALK] and mentioning 'finalizing evaluation.' Given that School_E is Student_E's 5th (last) choice, they are clearly waiting for a better offer. Since we are now in Round 6 and I have a remaining quota of 1, I must escalate the urgency significantly. I have already used strong language stating they are the top candidate. The strategy now is to issue a firm ultimatum, indicating that this is the final opportunity before I move definitively to my second choice (Student_B), thereby forcing Student_E's hand. Since Student_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."

Given that my chances of matching with my higher preferred schools (C, A, D, B) are low (I am 4th or 5th priority there), securing a definite match now, even with my lowest acceptable school, is a strong defensive move. Since I have talked with School_E extensively (6 rounds) without applying, it is time to formalize the interest and secure the spot, especially since they prioritize me highly. They will almost certainly accept."
