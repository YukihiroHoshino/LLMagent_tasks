However, Student_A is a highly sought-after student by other schools (School_B and School_D rank A 1st). Given that Student_A is highly motivated and ranks high on my list, securing this match in Round 1 guarantees a successful outcome (Rank 3) and prevents A from being matched by competitors.

Student_C, my Rank 2 student, has applied in Round 1 and listed School_D as their Rank 1 choice. While Student_A is my top priority, Student_A is also the top priority for School_B, and School_B is Student_A's Rank 2 choice, meaning Student_A is likely to be matched quickly elsewhere.
