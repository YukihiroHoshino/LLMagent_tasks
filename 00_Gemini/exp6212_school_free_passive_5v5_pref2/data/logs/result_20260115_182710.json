Student_D has engaged in extensive dialogue but remains non-committal, signaling they are coordinating their choices among multiple schools (where School_C is ranked last by them). Since School_C has a remaining quota of 1 and currently zero matches, securing a high-priority candidate like Student_D is crucial. I must continue the active appeal strategy, reinforcing the strong alignment and expressing high regard to encourage them to submit an application before they commit to a higher-ranked school. Since the student used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]."

We are extremely pleased to hear that School_A ranks so highly on your preference list, and we share your enthusiasm for a challenging and rigorous academic environment. Your interest in advanced independent study and research projects aligns perfectly with our core mission of fostering intellectual independence. We offer several unique resources specifically designed for high-achieving students pursuing independent work: \n\n1. **The 'Ignition Grant Program':** We offer competitive internal funding (up to $750) to support student-designed research, covering materials, travel for data collection, or specialized software. \n2. **Dedicated Faculty Research Directors:** Every student undertaking advanced independent study is paired with a specific faculty member who acts solely as a research director, providing weekly, high-level methodological guidance and intellectual mentorship, distinct from standard classroom instruction.\n3. **Access to University Partnerships:** Through formal agreements with local universities, our advanced students gain access to specialized labs, archives, and guest lectures that are typically unavailable to high school students.\n\nThese resources ensure that your ambition for advanced independent study is met with unparalleled expert guidance and financial support. We believe this environment is ideal for students who, like you, are eager to contribute actively to a challenging academic community. What specific fields of study are you hoping to explore independently?",

I must reply with a detailed and appealing answer to encourage Student_D to apply formally in the next possible round.

I have already engaged with and applied to School_D, School_B, and School_A (Ranks 3, 4, 2 respectively), indicating a high degree of commitment to finding a match.

Student_E has applied and stated that School_C is their absolute top preference (Rank 1 for them). While I have higher-ranked students (B, A, D) still unmatched, none of them have applied yet, and their preference for School_C is generally low (except B, who likely aims for School_E). Since Student_E is a committed applicant and ranks reasonably high on my list, securing this match now is a prudent strategy to fulfill my quota early and avoid the risk of missing out entirely if my top three choices match elsewhere. I will accept Student_E."
