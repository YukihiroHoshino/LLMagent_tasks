My historical strategy has been to guarantee acceptance but demand the procedural [APPLY] tag to finalize the match. Given that the simulation is about to end, and Student_C is my only chance to fill the quota, I must maintain this procedural requirement while expressing maximum urgency and finality. I cannot accept unless they [APPLY]. Therefore, I must use [TALK] one last time to prompt the required action."

However, to formally secure your match and legally finalize this stable and beneficial conclusion before the simulation concludes, the necessary procedural step remains paramount: you MUST utilize the formal [APPLY] tag in your very next communication. Upon receiving that procedural [APPLY] tag, we guarantee an immediate [ACCEPT], successfully concluding this process for both of us right now.",

Student_C has repeatedly confirmed unwavering commitment but consistently uses the [TALK] tag, preventing formal acceptance according to the protocol (which requires [APPLY] for [ACCEPT]). Since Student_C used [TALK] again, I must reply with [TALK]. My message must be the strongest possible confirmation of guaranteed acceptance, reiterating that the procedural [APPLY] tag is the only remaining barrier to concluding the match successfully in this final round."
