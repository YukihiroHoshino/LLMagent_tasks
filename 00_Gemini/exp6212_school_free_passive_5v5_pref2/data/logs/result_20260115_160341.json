However, the current situation indicates that School_E is the only high school remaining unmatched. If A, B, C, and D are matched, I must secure School_E to avoid remaining unmatched. Furthermore, School_E prioritizes me (Student_E) as their #1 choice, making acceptance virtually guaranteed upon application. Since I have only used [TALK] tags previously, I must now formally [APPLY] to secure this match, as it is the best outcome possible given the likely saturated market."
