We are ready to finalize this agreement immediately and officially extend your guaranteed offer of admission.

Upon receipt of your [APPLY] action in this final moment, we guarantee immediate acceptance. This is the absolute final opportunity to secure your placement before the market closes permanently.",
              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute definitive conclusion of the matching market. Student_E (Rank 4) is the highest-ranked available candidate and the only remaining student. If School_C does not secure a match now, the quota remains unfilled, which is worse than matching with Rank 4. Student_E has repeatedly confirmed absolute commitment (Rank 1 preference). Since Student_E sent [TALK], School_C must reply with [TALK] according to the rules, while making the guarantee of acceptance upon application absolute and immediate. The goal is to prompt Student_E to submit the required [APPLY] action, assuming the environment allows for a final action from the student after this communication."
