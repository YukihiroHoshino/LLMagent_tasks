I have already applied formally ([APPLY]) in a previous round and have sent numerous subsequent messages emphasizing my absolute commitment.

School_C has 1 remaining quota and must secure a match to fulfill its objective. The extensive history shows School_C has repeatedly guaranteed acceptance and urged Student_E to [APPLY]. Student_E continues to send [TALK] messages reaffirming commitment but avoiding the [APPLY] tag. Since Student_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK].
