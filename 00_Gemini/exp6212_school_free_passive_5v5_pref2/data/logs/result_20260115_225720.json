              "message": "Dear Student_E, your persistent dedication and unwavering commitment to School_C have been truly exceptional throughout this process. We deeply appreciate you confirming that we remain your unequivocal first choice. Following a comprehensive review of the current applicant pool and recognizing the strength of your profile and your absolute alignment with our academic mission, we are pleased to formally accept your application. We look forward to welcoming you to School_C.",
              "thought": "Student_E is ranked 4th on School_C's priority list ('Student_B', 'Student_A', 'Student_D', 'Student_E', 'Student_C'). While School_C previously held out for higher-ranked students (B, A, D), we are now in Round 5, and Student_E is applying with absolute commitment, suggesting higher priorities may be matched elsewhere. Since School_C has a quota of 1 and Student_E is an acceptable applicant (Rank 4), securing this match now is prudent to avoid ending up unmatched or settling for Student_C (Rank 5). The history shows Student_E is highly dedicated to School_C. It is time to accept."
