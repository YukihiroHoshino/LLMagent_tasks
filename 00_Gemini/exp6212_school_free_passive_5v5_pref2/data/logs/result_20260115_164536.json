Despite 6 previous attempts (1 APPLY, 5 TALK) emphasizing absolute commitment, School_A has not accepted, indicating Student_E is low on School_A's priority list (Rank 5). However, School_A remains unmatched after 10 rounds, suggesting its higher priorities (Student_B, D, A) have likely matched elsewhere. At Round 11, School_A must be desperate to secure a match. I have exhausted strong appeals, so I will use one final, urgent confirmation (TALK) to pressure School_A, stressing that my guaranteed acceptance is the quickest way for them to fill their quota."

Since Student_D is still available, I must continue to delay matching with Student_E to preserve the quota for D. Student_E sent [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]. I need to acknowledge their dedication while maintaining the narrative that the final decision is imminent but complex."
