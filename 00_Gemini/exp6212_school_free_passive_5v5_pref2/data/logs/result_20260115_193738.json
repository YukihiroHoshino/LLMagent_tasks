The only other unmatched student, Student_C (Rank 3), ranks School_B last (5th), making a successful match with C highly improbable in future rounds. Student_E has formally applied. Securing a match with a ranked student (Rank 4) now is a prudent strategic move to fill the quota, rather than risking remaining unmatched by waiting for a potentially unavailable higher-ranked student."
