Given that we are in Round 6 and my top two choices (A, B) are matched elsewhere, securing Student_D, who represents a solid Rank #4 and has shown strong commitment through multiple conversations, is a prudent strategy to guarantee a high-quality match and fulfill the quota, rather than risking being unmatched or settling for Rank #5 (Student_E) while waiting indefinitely for Student_C (Rank #3) to propose."
