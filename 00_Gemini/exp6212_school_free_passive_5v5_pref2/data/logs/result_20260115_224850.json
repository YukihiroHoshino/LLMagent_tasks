I have previously submitted a formal application and have sent numerous follow-up messages guaranteeing immediate acceptance. School_C ranks me 4th, meaning they have likely exhausted their top 3 choices (B, A, D). At this stage, School_C is either going to accept me or remain unmatched, as the market is effectively closed. My strategy remains the same: provide the ultimate, non-negotiable confirmation of commitment and acceptance to prompt School_C to finalize the match immediately, as delaying further serves no purpose for either party."
