This is a solid match, and I currently have no matches. Although Student_C ranks me last (5th), their immediate application signals a high commitment level, perhaps indicating they have been rejected by their higher preferences or wish to secure a spot quickly. My top priorities, Student_A (Rank 1) and Student_B (Rank 2), are likely to match elsewhere (S_B is Rank 1 for School_C, S_A prefers School_E first). Securing a Rank 3 match immediately fulfills my quota and prevents the risk of being left unmatched or having to accept a lower-ranked student later. I will accept Student_C."
