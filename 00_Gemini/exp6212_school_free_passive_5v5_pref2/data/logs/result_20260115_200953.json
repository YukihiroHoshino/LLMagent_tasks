For students passionate about advanced sciences, we offer specialized tracks, including our 'Scientific Discovery Incubator,' which provides dedicated lab time and mentorship from faculty engaged in active research. Extracurricularly, we host highly competitive teams in Robotics, Physics Olympiad, and Advanced Chemistry Research, often leading to participation in national competitions. These programs are specifically designed not just to complement rigor, but to allow students to apply theoretical knowledge in high-stakes, practical environments. Which specific area of science—biology, chemistry, or physics—are you most eager to explore further?",

Since I currently have no matches and a quota of 1, securing Student_C would be a good outcome, though I prefer waiting for Student_A or Student_B if possible. Student_C ranks School_B last (5th choice), so I must actively appeal to them to keep my school viable in their consideration set. They requested information about advanced science programs and extracurriculars, which I will answer thoroughly to highlight our strengths and address their specific interests, maintaining the conversation flow ([TALK])."
