Student_C applied directly, indicating strong interest despite School_D being their 4th choice. Given the low likelihood of securing a higher-ranked student and the risk of being left with only lower-ranked options (D or E) or no match, accepting the 3rd priority student who applied is the optimal strategy to secure a high-quality match immediately."
