I should provide an engaging answer to keep Student_C interested, as they are a viable option, but I should not push for an immediate match, reserving my quota for higher-priority Studets should they apply in subsequent rounds."

Our college counseling is highly personalized, starting formally in the sophomore year. Each student is assigned a dedicated counselor who maintains a low student-to-counselor ratio. We offer specialized workshops for standardized testing preparation, intensive essay writing clinics, and mock interviews. Crucially, we maintain strong relationships with admission offices at top-tier universities, offering specialized sessions and visits tailored specifically to our high-achieving students. This holistic approach ensures every student maximizes their potential for competitive applications.",

My higher priority students (Student_B and Student_D) are still available (Student_D is unmatched, Student_B's status is unknown but highly desired). I need to continue appealing strongly to Student_C to keep them highly interested in case my top choices are unavailable or reject me later, but I will not offer acceptance unless they apply, and only if market conditions warrant it. I will answer their question about college counseling robustly."

Student_D has engaged in four extensive TALK rounds and is now signaling readiness to apply by asking about the 'timeline for formal commitment,' indicating they are at the decision point. Since School_D has a quota of 1, securing a high-priority student like Student_D is crucial, even if Student_C is technically ranked higher. Given Student_D's strong interest and the high risk of losing them to School_E (their top choice), I must respond enthusiastically. I will answer their question about the timeline by emphasizing that their strong existing connection allows for a streamlined and rapid commitment process, effectively prompting them to apply in the next round."

To maximize my chance of securing my top preference, I must apply immediately. If School_A is already matched elsewhere (likely, given the market progression), School_D will accept me instantly. Even if A is still available, applying now signals strong commitment and might secure the spot if A applies elsewhere or if School_D rejects A for some reason (though unlikely in a standard DA algorithm, immediate application is key in this negotiation environment)."
