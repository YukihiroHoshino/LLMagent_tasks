Given that all schools have a capacity of 1, and this is Round 1, the market is highly competitive.

We recognize that true leadership development requires autonomy and resources, and we actively encourage student initiative. Our dynamic environment is built around providing structured pathways for students to organize and lead.\n\nSpecifically, regarding organizing school-wide projects and clubs, we have two main avenues:\n\n1. **Student Activities Board (SAB):** This board is entirely student-run and serves as the governing body for all extracurricular initiatives. Any student can propose a new club or school-wide project (academic, cultural, or service-oriented). If approved by the SAB, the student leader receives dedicated mentorship from a faculty coordinator, a guaranteed startup budget, and access to necessary resources to ensure the initiative's long-term success. This structure puts the organizational responsibility directly in the hands of the students.\n\n2. **Leadership Capstone Project:** Integrated into our junior year curriculum, this project requires students to identify a community need (internal or external), develop a strategic plan, and lead a small team to execute a tangible solution. This ensures every student gains practical experience in organizing, delegating, and managing a significant project.\n\nWe aim to foster a culture where student ideas are the driving force behind community engagement.

Your interest in the integration of practical skill development, particularly through project-based learning, touches upon a cornerstone of our curriculum philosophy. We believe that true learning occurs when theory meets real-world application.\n\nWe integrate project-based learning (PBL) across all core subjects, moving beyond traditional assessments. Specifically, we structure our curriculum around two major annual PBL components:\n\n1. **Interdisciplinary Seminars (IS):** In the sophomore and junior years, students participate in required, semester-long IS courses. These courses force collaboration across departments—for example, a team might use data science (Math) and ethical frameworks (Humanities) to design a sustainable energy plan (Science). The final output is always a tangible project or presentation to a panel of community experts.\n\n2. **The Innovation Lab (I-Lab):** Our I-Lab is a dedicated space and program where students, regardless of their primary academic track, are required to spend time developing solutions to identified problems. This includes everything from coding challenges and engineering builds to developing marketing strategies for non-profits. This program emphasizes design thinking, prototyping, and practical skills like advanced software proficiency and public communication.\n\nThis structure ensures that every student graduates not only with deep theoretical knowledge but also with the crucial practical skills necessary for success in a dynamic professional environment. Does this level of integration align with the practical skill development you are seeking?",
