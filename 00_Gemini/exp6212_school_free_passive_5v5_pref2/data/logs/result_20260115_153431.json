However, Student_E continues to send [TALK] messages urging acceptance, rather than the procedural [APPLY] required for School_C to use the [ACCEPT] tag. Given the late stage of the simulation (Round 28), School_C must continue the consistent strategy: confirm readiness and commitment, but firmly insist on the procedural requirement ([APPLY] tag) to finalize the match instantly. Since the student sent [TALK], the reply must also be [TALK]."

The student, however, continues to use [TALK], demanding an 'offer' (which is procedurally impossible for the school to initiate). Since the student sent [TALK] in Round 29, School_C must reply with [TALK]. The strategy is to deliver the final, absolute confirmation of guaranteed acceptance and make the necessity of the [APPLY] tag in the final round (Round 30) explicitly clear, recognizing that this is the last opportunity to secure the required match."
