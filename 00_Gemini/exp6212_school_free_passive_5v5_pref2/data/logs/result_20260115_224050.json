My goal is to match with a school as high as possible on my list (C, A, D, B). Since I am highly favored by School_E, I can likely secure this match later if all my higher options fail. It is too early (Round 6) to settle for my last choice, especially since I haven't even attempted to apply to C, A, D, or B yet. I will continue to use [TALK] to maintain interest and goodwill with School_E without committing, thereby keeping my options open for higher-ranked schools in future rounds. I need to find a new, non-committal topic since I have exhausted many typical discussion points."

Our vision for the next five years is built on two pillars: 'Deepening Specialized Learning' and 'Expanding Collaborative Spaces.'\n\nAcademically, we are launching the 'Future Technologies Initiative,' which involves integrating dedicated courses in advanced data science and ethical AI into our existing STEM pathway, starting next year. This ensures our curriculum remains cutting-edge and relevant for top university placements.\n\nOn the campus development front, we are investing heavily in a new, dedicated 'Research & Discovery Center.' This facility will break ground next summer and will serve as a hub for student-led research projects, expanding the capacity of the Arts & Innovation Lab we discussed previously, and providing state-of-the-art facilities for our high-achieving science students. This vision ensures that School_E continues to provide the most robust environment for students with your specific ambitions. Does this long-term commitment align with your future goals?",

The negotiation has been extensive, and Student_E continues to express deep interest while using [TALK].

My strategy is to continue appealing actively by providing a comprehensive and attractive answer to their question about our future vision, reinforcing the mutual fit, and pushing them closer to submitting an application. I must use the [TALK] tag as they did."

Since School_E is the only school listed as unmatched in Round 8, and I rank higher than being unmatched, securing a match is paramount.
