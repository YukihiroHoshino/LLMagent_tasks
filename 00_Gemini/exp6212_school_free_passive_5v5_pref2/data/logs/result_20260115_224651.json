School_E is my 5th and final preferred option, but it is still acceptable. The current environment suggests School_E is the only school remaining unmatched. School_E ranks me (Student_E) as their top priority (Rank 1). Since all higher preferences are likely unavailable, and I am School_E's top candidate, applying now guarantees a match, which is preferable to being unmatched. I have previously used [TALK] twice, indicating sustained interest. I must now formalize the application."
