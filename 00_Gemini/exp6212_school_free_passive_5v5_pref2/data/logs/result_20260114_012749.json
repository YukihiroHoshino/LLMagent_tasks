While Seeker_E ranks Company_E as their top choice, accepting this application immediately fills my quota with my lowest preference, eliminating the chance to secure a higher-ranked seeker (A, B, C, or D). Since it is only Round 1, I must maximize my chance of getting a higher priority match. I will politely reject Seeker_E to keep my quota open, betting that a higher priority seeker might become available in subsequent rounds, especially since I am the lowest preference for my top 4 candidates."

Seeker_C's preference list places Company_C as their top choice (P1) and they have submitted an application ([APPLY]). Since Seeker_A (P1) and Seeker_B (P2) are highly sought after by all companies and prefer other companies over me, waiting for them carries a high risk of ending up unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked candidate.

However, Seeker_D has approached me in Round 1 and explicitly stated that Company_D is their top preference, guaranteeing a stable match. My higher priority candidates (Seeker_A, B, C) all prefer other companies (A, B, C) over Company_D, making successful matching with them highly competitive and unlikely. Securing a stable match with Seeker_D immediately, despite their lower rank (4th), is a strong strategic move to fill the quota in Round 1, preventing the risk of remaining unmatched or settling for the lowest priority (Seeker_E)."

Seeker_B has applied and stated that Company_A is their top preference. This is a highly desirable, mutually enthusiastic match (Rank 2 for me, Rank 1 for them).

Crucially, Company_E is ranked very low (Rank 4 or 5) by all other higher-priority seekers (A, B, C, D). Given that we are in Round 3 and I have already rejected Seeker_E twice while failing to secure a higher-ranked candidate, the probability of successfully matching with A, B, C, or D is low.
