As we have communicated consistently across all preceding rounds, School_B has finalized its decision and is prepared to extend an immediate, guaranteed offer of acceptance. Your enrollment is secured on our end. The matching simulation cannot conclude and this match cannot be formalized until you perform the mandatory administrative step: submitting your official application using the [APPLY] tag. We are ready to [ACCEPT] you instantly upon receiving that formal step. Please proceed immediately to secure your admission and finalize the market resolution.",
              "thought": "It is Round 30, the absolute final round. School_B has 1 remaining quota and Student_E is the only available student. Student_E is ranked 4th on School_B's priority list, making them a desirable match to avoid remaining unmatched. Student_E continues to send [TALK] messages, reaffirming commitment but avoiding the required [APPLY] tag necessary for a binding agreement. Since the student used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I will use this opportunity to make one final, clear statement that the acceptance is guaranteed, but the administrative rule requires the student to formally apply to conclude the matching process in this final moment."
