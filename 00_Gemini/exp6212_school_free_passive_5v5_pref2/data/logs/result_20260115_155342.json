After thorough research into your school's challenging curriculum and strong focus on student development, I have determined that School_D is my absolute first choice. I am formally submitting my application now, hoping for the opportunity to join your community.",
              "thought": "School_D is my absolute top preference (Rank 1). I am ranked 2nd by School_D, immediately after Student_A. Given that it is Round 4 and the goal is to secure the highest possible match, applying immediately is the optimal strategy for my top choice, especially since the market environment allows for immediate agreement upon application and acceptance. If Student_A is matched elsewhere or is not applying to School_D, I stand a very high chance of being accepted."

Your academic profile and expressed commitment to our challenging environment make you an outstanding candidate. Given the strength of your application and your high fit with our institution's values, we are delighted to offer you admission to School_D immediately.",
              "thought": "School_D's objective is to match with the highest possible priority student within the quota (1). Student_C is ranked 2nd on School_D's True Priority List: ['Student_A' (1), 'Student_C' (2), 'Student_D' (3), 'Student_E' (4), 'Student_B' (5)]. Student_C has applied and stated that School_D is their 'absolute first choice' (Rank 1 preference). This is a highly favorable, secure match with a very high-priority candidate. Although Student_A (Rank 1) is available, Student_A has not applied yet, and waiting risks losing the quota entirely or settling for a lower-ranked student. Securing Student_C now is an excellent outcome, maximizing priority given the application certainty."
