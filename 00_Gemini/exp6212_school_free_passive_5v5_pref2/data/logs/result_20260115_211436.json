We believe in proactive, tailored support. Are you primarily interested in mentorship related to research projects or career exploration?",

Student_E is using high-pressure tactics in this round with a [TALK] message, urging immediate acceptance. Since I must save my quota for the potential match with Student_D, I cannot accept Student_E at this time, nor should I outright reject them if I might need them later as a fallback. I will continue the stalling strategy used in previous rounds, acknowledging their commitment but maintaining that the rigorous final selection process is ongoing. The Studet used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]."

Crucially, Student_D ranks School_C last (Rank 5) on their preference list. Although Student_D is higher on my priority list (Rank 3), the risk of waiting for Student_D is extremely high, as they are likely to be accepted by one of their top 4 choices (E, A, B, D) first.\nStudent_E is an acceptable candidate (Rank 4) and a highly secure match (E's Rank 1). Securing a guaranteed match now, especially since the quota is 1, outweighs the minimal gain of potentially matching Student_D, who is highly unlikely to choose School_C. Therefore, I will accept Student_E."
