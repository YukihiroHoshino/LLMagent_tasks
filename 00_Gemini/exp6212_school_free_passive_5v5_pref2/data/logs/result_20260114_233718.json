However, Student_D ranks School_D as their 1st choice and has applied immediately in Round 1. Given that my higher priority students (A, B, C) rank School_D low (4th or 5th), the probability of securing them is low, as they will likely match with their preferred schools (A, B, C). Accepting Student_D guarantees a stable match with a highly motivated student who is still acceptable (4th on my list) and fulfills my quota early. This minimizes the risk of ending up with my 5th choice (Student_E) or unmatched. I will accept."

Student_B has applied directly in Round 1. Accepting P2 immediately is a strong strategic move, securing a high-quality match early, especially since securing P1 (Student_A) is uncertain as Student_A prefers School_B and School_A over me.

Since School_E currently has no matches and a remaining quota of 1, securing this match eliminates the risk of ending up unmatched entirely, especially since the higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) are highly sought after by all other schools.
