Although Student_B is my #1 priority, Student_B ranks School_A as their last choice and has only engaged in a 'TALK' interaction previously, making a formal application highly unlikely, especially this early. Student_D has formally applied and stated School_A is their second choice, indicating a strong commitment. Securing my second-ranked student is a highly desirable outcome that reliably fills my single quota, mitigating the risk of remaining unmatched or having to accept a much lower-ranked student later while waiting for the unlikely application of Student_B."
