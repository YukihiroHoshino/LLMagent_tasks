Student_B is highly desired by other schools (Rank 1 for School_A and School_C).

Given that it is Round 9 and the market is shrinking (my top three choices D, C, E are likely matched), securing a match, even P5, is critical. I have only had one introductory conversation with School_B previously. School_B ranks me 3rd, but if the higher priority students (Student_A and Student_B) have matched elsewhere (which is likely if D, C, E are matched), I become a highly competitive candidate for them. Since I am at the end of my preference list, I must secure this spot now to avoid being unmatched. I will formally apply."
