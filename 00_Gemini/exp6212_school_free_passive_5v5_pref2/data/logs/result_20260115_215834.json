We don't just teach the material; we ensure our students can apply it successfully. Regarding internships, we leverage strong partnerships with local tech firms, research labs, and civic organizations, often facilitating summer internships specifically for our high-performing AP students in fields like engineering, data science, and pre-medicine. As for post-graduation outcomes, 98% of our AP participants attend their first or second-choice university. Furthermore, students who complete three or more AP courses with a score of 4 or higher receive, on average, $25,000 more in merit scholarships across their college acceptance packages compared to the general student body. This demonstrates the high regard universities hold for our graduates. We truly believe the ROI on our AP program is unparalleled.",
