School_E is my lowest ranked choice (Rank 5), but it is still preferable to being unmatched. School_E ranks me as their top priority (Rank 1). The current situation indicates that the list of high schools not yet matched is only ['School_E']. This implies that School_C, School_A, School_D, and School_B are already matched with other students, making School_E the highest available option remaining for me. Given that I am their top priority, an application guarantees an acceptance. To maximize my outcome given the constraints, I must secure this match now."
