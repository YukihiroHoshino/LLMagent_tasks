Student_E (Rank 4) is available, ranks School_C first (Rank 1), and is applying enthusiastically for the second time despite a previous rejection. Since Student_E is high enough on my list (Rank 4/5) and is extremely committed, securing this match now is a very good outcome, minimizing the risk of losing the quota entirely while hoping for the low-probability match with Student_D. I will accept Student_E."
