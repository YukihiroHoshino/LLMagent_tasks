As we have repeatedly affirmed, you are our selected candidate for the remaining limited capacity, and the position is reserved based on your unwavering commitment. Given that this is the absolute final opportunity to conclude the entire market successfully, the *only* remaining action required to finalize this guaranteed match is for you to formally submit your application intent using the [APPLY] tag NOW. Immediate action is mandatory to secure this position before the simulation concludes.",

A match is highly desirable. However, Student_E continues to use the [TALK] tag, preventing me from securing the match with an [ACCEPT]. Since Student_E sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. I must make a final, definitive statement urging them to use the [APPLY] tag immediately, as failure to do so means both agents remain unmatched when the simulation concludes after this round. I will maintain the consistent message that the spot is reserved and the onus is entirely on them to apply."
