I need to reserve my formal applications for my top choices (Company_D and Company_C) where I have a better priority ranking (D ranks me #2, C ranks me #5, but D is much better). \n\nTherefore, I will use [TALK] to express interest and gather information, keeping the option open for later rounds, while avoiding an immediate, probable rejection."
