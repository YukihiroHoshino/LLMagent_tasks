Your previous application showed strong potential. To address your question about finalizing your candidacy, we are currently zeroing in on candidates who can immediately impact our upcoming Q3 platform launch, which involves complex optimization algorithms. Could you elaborate on a specific past project where you successfully implemented or designed a highly scalable solution involving data modeling or optimization techniques, and detail the technical challenges you overcame? This level of detail will significantly aid our internal review process.",

I must maintain their interest without committing, hoping to secure Seeker_E or Seeker_B first. Since the current tag is [TALK], I must reply with [TALK].
