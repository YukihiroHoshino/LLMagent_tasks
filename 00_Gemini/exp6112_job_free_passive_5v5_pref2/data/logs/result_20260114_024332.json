Given that we are in Round 4 and only two companies (A and C) remain unmatched, the market is contracting. Company_A is a strong candidate for a stable match. Since the mutual ranking is favorable, I should move decisively to secure this position before other highly ranked seekers (like Seeker_B) apply or if Company_A decides to accept a lower-ranked seeker out of desperation. I will use the [APPLY] tag."

They have formally applied and stated that Company_A is their second most preferred placement, indicating high commitment and preference alignment. My highest priority candidate, Seeker_B, ranks Company_A last (#5), making a match highly improbable. Given that I have only one remaining quota, securing Seeker_D immediately is the optimal strategy to maximize my priority score while minimizing risk. I will accept the application."
