Company_A ranks me (Seeker_D) second on their priority list (Rank 2: ['Seeker_B', 'Seeker_D', ...]). This is a highly favorable pairing. Since Company_A is a top priority and I am a high priority for them, securing this match quickly is crucial, especially since we are already in Round 3 and two companies (C and E) are presumably matched. I will formally apply to maximize my chances of securing this high-ranking position."
