Seeker_E is signaling that they are evaluating other opportunities (where Company_B is 4th on their list), so providing a clear, expedited timeline is necessary to maintain their interest without offering a formal acceptance.

Since Seeker_E is ranked higher than Seeker_C (whom I previously rejected), Seeker_E represents the highest remaining priority available to me. Furthermore, Seeker_E ranks Company_C as their number one preference.
