Accepting Seeker_A (P3) now locks the quota, preventing a match with P1 (Seeker_E) or P2 (Seeker_B). Seeker_B is highly contested by other companies (P1 for C, P1 for A). I need to preserve the quota for a potentially higher-ranked candidate who might appear in the next few rounds. Given Seeker_A's repeated strong commitment, there is a risk of losing them, but I must prioritize securing the highest possible rank.
