However, Seeker_E is applying significant pressure due to external offers, and I previously rejected them. Seeker_E is a low priority for Company_B (4th preference) but is the highest available candidate actively signaling immediate commitment. Seeker_C (3rd priority) is also available but has shown no urgency and ranks Company_B last (5th preference). If I delay too much, I risk losing Seeker_E and potentially ending up with no match if C doesn't materialize. Since E used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I will use this response to confirm that E is a finalist and that a decision is imminent, aiming to keep E engaged for one more round while I try to assess C's status, or push E to [APPLY] again, which I would likely accept given the market pressure and my need to fill the quota."

While Company_E is preferred, Company_E ranks Seeker_C last (5th), making acceptance highly unlikely. Company_B ranks Seeker_C 3rd, offering a much higher probability of a successful match.\nGiven the late stage of the simulation (Round 7) and the risk of remaining unemployed if I fail to secure a match, it is strategically sound to lock in the match with Company_B, despite it being my lowest preference. I will formalize my application based on the previous discussion regarding career trajectories."

Since Seeker_A (1st) and Seeker_B (2nd) are presumed matched elsewhere (as they are not listed among the unmatched), Seeker_C is the highest-ranking candidate currently available. The only other remaining candidate is Seeker_E (4th). Given that Seeker_C has formally applied and is a high priority, accepting this offer secures the best possible match under the current circumstances and fills the single quota. Rejecting Seeker_C risks losing them entirely, as Company_B is Seeker_C's lowest preference."

Although I prefer Company_B (Rank 4), I am paired with Company_E (Rank 5) this round. Critically, Company_E ranks Seeker_E as their #1 priority. Given this strong mutual fit (from their perspective) and my desire to secure an acceptable match before the pool disappears, applying now guarantees a match. I have previously used [TALK] twice, maintaining interest without committing. Now is the time to convert that interest into a formal application and secure the position."
