Only Seeker_C (3rd choice) and Seeker_E (4th choice) are unmatched. While Seeker_C is ranked higher, Seeker_C ranks Company_B last (5th) and has only engaged in [TALK]. Seeker_E is actively reapplying and offering immediate acceptance, indicating high commitment. Since I previously rejected Seeker_E and they are reapplying, this match is highly stable. Given the low probability of securing my 3rd choice (Seeker_C) due to their low preference for Company_B, and the risk of ending up unmatched if I continue to hold out, securing my 4th choice now is the optimal strategy to maximize priority within the guaranteed quota fulfillment. I will accept Seeker_E."
