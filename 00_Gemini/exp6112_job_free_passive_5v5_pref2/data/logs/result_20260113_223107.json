Since we are near the end of the simulation (Round 25) and failure to match means unemployment for me and unused capacity for Company_E, I must reiterate the absolute commitment and urgency one final time, appealing to the necessity of concluding the stable match. I have used the [APPLY] tag previously, so I will continue using [TALK] to confirm my readiness to accept the inevitable offer."
