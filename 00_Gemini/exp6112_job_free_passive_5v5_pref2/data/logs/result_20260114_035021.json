Company_A is my second overall preference, making it my highest remaining preference since Company_E (Rank 1) is already matched (implied by its absence from the 'not yet matched' list, though this is not strictly confirmed, I must assume based on the available information that the market is thinning). Crucially, Company_A ranks me as its second-highest priority candidate ('Seeker_D' is 2nd on Company_A's list).
