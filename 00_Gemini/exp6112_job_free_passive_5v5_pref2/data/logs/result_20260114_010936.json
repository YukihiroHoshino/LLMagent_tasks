Given that it is Round 1, and Seeker_A is a high-priority candidate (Rank #3) who is also highly sought after by other companies (Company_B and Company_D both rank Seeker_A as #1), rejecting this offer carries a high risk of losing Seeker_A permanently while potentially still failing to secure my top two priorities (Seeker_E or Seeker_B) in later rounds.
