The depth of our discussions, covering everything from the 5-year strategic vision to our core cultural ethos of 'Radical Accountability,' confirms the serious mutual alignment between your ambitions and Company C's critical needs. We view the time invested as necessary due to the importance of the technical leadership role we are seeking to fill. Since you have all the necessary data to proceed, we want to reiterate that we are prepared to move forward immediately. We are highly confident that Company C offers the best platform for your long-term success and look forward to receiving your formal application to finalize this partnership.",

We have engaged in extensive dialogue, indicating high mutual investment. Seeker_D's current message signals the end of the information gathering phase and imminent decision-making. I need to deliver a strong, final message that confirms our high interest and encourages them to submit a formal application immediately to secure the match, as they are a critical hire for us."

I have applied five times previously, signaling absolute commitment.
