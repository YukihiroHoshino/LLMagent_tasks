Although Company_C ranks Seeker_E relatively low (4th), given that I have already applied to lower-ranked companies (A and B) and we are in Round 7, it is critical to secure my top choice immediately. Since this is the first interaction, an aggressive [APPLY] is warranted to signal maximum commitment and try to secure the match before other top-ranked seekers for Company_C (Seeker_B, Seeker_A, Seeker_D) potentially match elsewhere or before Company_C fills its quota."

The highest remaining priority is Seeker_D (Rank 3). However, Seeker_D ranks Company_C last (5th preference), making a match difficult and unstable. Seeker_E, conversely, ranks Company_C first (1st preference) and has submitted a formal application, stating this role is their 'absolute top priority.' Securing a committed match at Rank 4 is strategically sound, preventing the risk of losing the quota while waiting for the highly unlikely match with Seeker_D. I will accept Seeker_E."
