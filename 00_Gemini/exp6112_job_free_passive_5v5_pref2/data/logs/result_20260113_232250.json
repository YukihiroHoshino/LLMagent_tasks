Applying immediately ([APPLY]) is highly likely to result in a rejection, as Company_A will likely hold out for higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_B, Seeker_D, Seeker_A, Seeker_C). Given the high preference but extremely low priority, I should use [TALK] to express strong interest and try to appeal to them, while conserving the formal application for my top choice (Company_C) or a company where I have a better chance. This allows me to gauge their immediate openness without committing to a rejection."

We are currently in the initial stages of evaluating candidates.",

Since it is Round 1 and I have not secured a higher priority match, I must keep my options open. Seeker_E initiated [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]. I should provide an engaging answer to maintain their interest, as they rank me 2nd, but avoid encouraging an immediate application, preserving my quota for higher ranked seekers in subsequent rounds."

Given that higher-ranked candidates (Seeker_A, Seeker_D) rank Company_C very low (5th choice), and Seeker_E is enthusiastic and ready to commit (reducing market uncertainty), securing this match is a strong strategic move, especially since I currently have zero matches and a quota of 1.
