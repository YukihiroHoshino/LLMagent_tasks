Seeker_E is my 4th overall priority, but potentially my highest available match if Seeker_A, B, and D are already matched (as implied by the remaining list). Seeker_E ranks Company_B 4th, meaning they are acceptable to Seeker_E. The only remaining candidate ranked higher than Seeker_E on my list is Seeker_C (3rd overall), but Seeker_C ranks Company_B last (5th), making a match with Seeker_C highly improbable. To secure a match and fulfill my quota with an acceptable candidate who has formally applied, I should accept Seeker_E, mitigating the risk of going unmatched or being forced to take my lowest priority later."
