Seeker_C is applying now, despite Company_B being their last preference (5th), suggesting they might be struggling to match elsewhere. Given that it is only Round 4, I choose to hold my single quota open for a higher priority candidate (Seeker_A or Seeker_B).

Since I have already demonstrated strong commitment, applying again would be redundant and potentially desperate, especially since I aim for a higher match (D, C, E, A). To preserve my availability for superior companies and avoid locking into my worst option early, I will shift the interaction from formal application to a check-in ([TALK]).

Since they are still unmatched in Round 8, it is highly probable that their top two candidates (A and B) have accepted matches with other companies (A, C, D, E).

Given the high competition for my top choices and Seeker_C's proven commitment and strong strategic planning skills (which I previously acknowledged as crucial), the risk of losing Seeker_C while failing to secure Seeker_A or Seeker_B is too high.
