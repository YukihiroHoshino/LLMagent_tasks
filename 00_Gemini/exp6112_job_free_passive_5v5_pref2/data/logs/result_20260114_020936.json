My history shows I have previously applied to Company_B (implied rejection or no match, as they are still available).

However, Seeker_E has immediately reapplied, demonstrating strong commitment and fit based on our extensive prior discussions. Given that we are in Round 5, and securing a match is crucial, accepting Seeker_E (who is still within my acceptable priority range) is a prudent move to fill the quota. Waiting longer risks losing Seeker_E to another company (Company_C, Company_A, or Company_D, where they rank higher) and potentially failing to secure a match at all, or being forced to match with Seeker_D (my lowest priority). I will accept this persistent application."
