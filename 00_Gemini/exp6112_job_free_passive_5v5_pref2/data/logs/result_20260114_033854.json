I have already applied twice to Company_D (Rank 3) without securing a match, likely because Company_D ranks me 4th and is holding out for Seeker_A or Seeker_C. Given the high certainty of acceptance from Company_E, and the low probability of securing a higher-ranked company (D) quickly, securing this match guarantees employment. Although it is my lowest preference, it is the most stable and immediate option available against a highly favorable partner. I will formally apply."

Although Seeker_E ranks Company_E last in their preferences, securing my top choice when the opportunity arises is the most strategic move to fulfill my objective of matching with the highest possible priority Job Seeker. I will accept the application immediately."
