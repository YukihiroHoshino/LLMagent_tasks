This requires ensuring seamless data pipeline integration and achieving defined efficiency targets (as we discussed previously regarding scaling).\n\n2. **Phase II (Months 7-12): Expansion and Feature Development.** This phase involves transitioning the optimized platform into two new major market segments. The key contribution here will be designing and implementing the necessary modular architecture to support rapid geographic scaling, including integrating two new high-demand features driven by customer feedback. The successful candidate will be the technical anchor ensuring these critical milestones are met on time, positioning us for market leadership in Q4.
