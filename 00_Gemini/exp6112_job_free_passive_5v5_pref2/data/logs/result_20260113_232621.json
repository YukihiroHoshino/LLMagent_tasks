Seeker_C has sent an [APPLY] message. Furthermore, Seeker_C ranks Company_D as their top choice (Rank 1). This is an extremely favorable and stable match. Given the high priority and the immediate application, securing this match now is the optimal strategy, despite Seeker_A still being available, as market dynamics are unpredictable. I will accept the application."

Given that I have already pursued my higher preferences (C, B) and the market is moving into Round 4, securing a stable match is becoming important. Since Company_E represents a guaranteed match and is still preferable to unemployment, I should secure this position now. I will formalize the interest developed during the previous 'TALK' interaction and submit an application."
