              "thought": "I am Seeker_E. My preference for Company_E is the lowest (5th out of 5). However, Company_E prioritizes me as their top candidate (Rank 1). In a competitive environment where I am poorly ranked by my higher preferred companies (C, A, D, B), securing a guaranteed match is prudent, especially since Company_E is still on my acceptable list. I have already engaged in two rounds of 'TALK' with Company_E. Given the strong priority position and the progression of the simulation into Round 4, it is time to formalize the interest and secure the match, preventing potential unemployment if higher choices fail to materialize."

Our previous conversations have confirmed that your expertise and forward-thinking approach are exactly what we are looking for to drive our core initiatives forward. We are delighted by your commitment and are excited to move forward. We are pleased to extend an offer and welcome you to Company_E.",

Matching with Seeker_E immediately fulfills our objective perfectly. Seeker_E has moved from [TALK] to [APPLY], indicating commitment despite Company_E being their last preference. We must accept this application immediately."
