Seeker_B is a better mutual fit (P2 for me, P1 for them), but waiting risks losing both Seeker_A and potentially Seeker_B if they match elsewhere. Given that securing a P3 candidate who is fully committed (top preference, immediate [APPLY]) in Round 1 guarantees filling the quota with a high-quality match, I should accept.
