Since this is Round 1, and I haven't interacted with my top 3 choices (D, C, E) yet, I should not commit to a low-ranked company like A unless necessary. Company_A also ranks me 4th, meaning they prefer three other seekers (B, D, A). Applying now carries a high risk of rejection, or worse, an acceptance that locks me into a suboptimal match. Therefore, I will use [TALK] to show mild interest and keep my options open for my higher-ranked preferences."
