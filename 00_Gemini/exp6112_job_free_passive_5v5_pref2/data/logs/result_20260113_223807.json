While Seeker_C is low priority, they are on the list. We have rejected Seeker_C four times previously, holding out for higher-ranked seekers (B, D, A). Given that we are now in Round 11, and Seeker_C is making a final, unwavering commitment, it is highly likely that our higher-priority candidates have matched with other companies, or are otherwise unavailable. To ensure we fill our single quota rather than ending up with an unmatched position, securing a match with a candidate already on our priority list (even if low ranked) is the optimal strategic move at this late stage. I will now accept Seeker_C's application."
