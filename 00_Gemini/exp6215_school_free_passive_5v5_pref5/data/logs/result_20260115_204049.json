Although Student_D is highly committed (ranking School_B #1), accepting a Rank 4 student in Round 3, when higher-ranked candidates (E, B, C) are still available, violates my strategy of maximizing priority. I must continue to reserve the spot for Student_E or Student_B, or potentially Student_C if they re-approach, unless the market stabilizes and I risk going unmatched.
