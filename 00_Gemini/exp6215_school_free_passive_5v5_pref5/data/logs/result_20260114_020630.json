This makes Company_D my second highest available option after Company_C (Rank 1). I previously applied to Company_C, but a match was not established (as C is still available). Company_D prioritizes me (Seeker_C) 3rd overall. If Seekers A and B are matched elsewhere, I am Company_D's highest remaining priority, making an acceptance highly likely.
