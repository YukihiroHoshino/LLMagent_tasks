Student_D is ranked #2 on my True Priority List ['Student_E', 'Student_D', 'Student_A', 'Student_B', 'Student_C']. Since Student_D is a very high priority target and I have an open quota, I must accept this application immediately to secure a high-quality match. Rejecting them would be counterproductive, as Student_E (rank #1) is not available, making Student_D the best available option."
