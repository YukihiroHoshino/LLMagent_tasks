Your commitment and academic profile align perfectly with School_A's values. We enthusiastically accept your application and look forward to welcoming you to our community!",
              "thought": "I am School_A, and my goal is to secure the highest priority student possible within my quota of 1. My priority list places Student_C third (Student_A > Student_B > Student_C). Since my quota is currently 1 and Student_C is a highly ranked candidate who has applied and reaffirmed their strong interest, securing this match is strategically sound. While Student_A and Student_B are slightly preferred, waiting for them carries the risk of them matching elsewhere, potentially leaving me with lower-ranked students or unmatched. I will accept Student_C."
