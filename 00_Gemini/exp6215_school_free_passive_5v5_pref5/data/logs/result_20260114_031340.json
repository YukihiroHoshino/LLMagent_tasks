I currently have no matches and a quota of 1. Although Seeker_A (Rank 1) and Seeker_B (Rank 2) are higher, securing a Rank 3 candidate who has actively applied is a strong outcome, especially since my chances with A and B are uncertain (A is currently talking, B ranks me last). I previously rejected Seeker_D (Rank 4) to keep options open for higher ranks. Since Seeker_C is a highly ranked preference and has made a formal application, accepting them fills my quota efficiently and prevents the risk of being left with only lower-ranked or unmotivated candidates."

Accepting Seeker_D now, who is ranked lower than the previously rejected Seeker_C, contradicts my high-stakes strategy.

I have already applied to Company_B previously, but the history does not show a definitive response ([ACCEPT] or [REJECT]).
