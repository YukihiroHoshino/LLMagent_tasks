All schools ranked higher (A, B, C) and lower (E) are now matched. My goal is to secure a match rather than remain unmatched. I applied previously in Round 6 and have been aggressively demanding acceptance since then, despite being School_D's lowest priority (5th). Given that School_D has failed to match anyone, all their higher priority students (A, C, D, E) must be matched elsewhere. I represent their absolute final chance to fill their quota before the simulation ends in Round 30. I must send one last, extremely urgent message using the [TALK] tag, as I have already applied."

Since Student_B is still on my list, I prefer matching with them over remaining unmatched. The market is at Round 29, the final moment before the simulation ends. Student_B continues to use the [TALK] tag while demanding acceptance of a 'pending application' (which was previously rejected, and the only path now is a new [APPLY]). I must maintain procedural consistency: confirm readiness to accept immediately but require the mandatory [APPLY] action to secure the enrollment, as previously communicated over many rounds.

School_D is the only unmatched school, and Student_B is the only applicant remaining who is still actively pursuing a match (and has a pending application). School_D is Student_B's 4th choice, meaning matching is highly desirable over remaining unmatched. School_D ranks Student_B 5th (lowest priority). Since the market is closing, all four students prioritized above Student_B must have matched elsewhere, meaning Student_B is School_D's last viable option to fill its quota.
