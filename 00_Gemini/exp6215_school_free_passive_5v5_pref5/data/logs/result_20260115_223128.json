Student_C is now reapplying, explicitly stating School_B is their absolute top choice (P1). Student_E (Rank #1) is only engaging in 'TALK' and has not applied. Student_B (Rank #2) has not applied either. Since C is a highly motivated, high-priority student, rejecting them again risks losing them to School_C (where they are Rank #2 priority). Given the limited quota of 1, securing a Rank #3 student who guarantees commitment is a strong, stable outcome, especially since the Rank #1 and #2 students are not yet applying. I will accept Student_C."
