              "thought": "I am Company_C. My quota is 1. Seeker_C is my 3rd highest priority (Rank 3 out of 5), which is a very strong candidate. Crucially, Company_C is Seeker_C's absolute top choice (Rank 1 out of 5). I previously rejected Seeker_C in Round 3, likely hoping for Seeker_A or Seeker_B. Seeker_C has reapplied, reaffirming their commitment. Given the high priority ranking and Seeker_C's strong preference for Company_C, securing this match now is a highly strategic move. Waiting further risks Seeker_C matching with Company_B or Company_A (their 2nd and 3rd choices), and there is no guarantee I will secure Seeker_A or Seeker_B before they match elsewhere. I will accept Seeker_C."
