Your institution is highly regarded, and I am particularly interested in how your curriculum prepares students for STEM university pathways. Could you elaborate on the specific advanced placement courses offered in science and mathematics?",

While School_E ranks me first, securing this match now (Round 3) would bind me and prevent me from pursuing my top choices (B, C, A). Since I have not yet interacted with my top 2 choices (B and C), and School_A is still pending, I should keep my options open. Since School_E ranks me highest, I can afford to delay a formal application. I will use [TALK] to maintain interest and gather more information without committing to a binding match yet."

Our curriculum is designed not just for high scores, but for deep conceptual mastery and practical application through our interdisciplinary project-based framework.\n\nRegarding advanced placement, we offer a robust selection in science and mathematics that directly supports top university applications:\n\nIn Mathematics, we offer AP Calculus AB and BC, and AP Statistics.\n\nIn Science, we offer AP Physics C (both Mechanics and Electricity & Magnetism), AP Chemistry, and AP Biology. Crucially, we also offer AP Computer Science A, integrated with our Innovation Lab, ensuring students gain essential coding and engineering skills. Our graduates consistently gain admission to highly selective engineering and science programs, a testament to the rigor and depth of these courses. What specific area of STEM are you most passionate about pursuing?",
              "thought": "Student_A is my absolute top priority (Rank #1). Although Student_A ranks School_E low (Rank #4), this is a critical interaction. Since Student_A used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK] and provide a highly detailed and appealing response, focusing specifically on their interest in STEM. I need to demonstrate that our STEM program is superior, potentially overcoming their preference for schools B, C, and A. I will highlight our specific high-level AP offerings and connect them to successful university placement."
