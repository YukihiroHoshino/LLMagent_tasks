They are asking final, critical questions about the acceptance timeline and criteria, indicating they are extremely close to applying. My strategy is to provide clear, attractive answers to encourage them to apply immediately, emphasizing that they fit the profile we are seeking. Since they used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."

Assuming all my higher preferences (C, D, A, E) have already matched with other students or are otherwise unavailable, matching with School_B is the best outcome (Rank 5 is better than unmatched). Furthermore, I am School_B's top priority ('Student_E'). After 4 rounds of merely talking, it is time to formalize my interest. Applying now guarantees a match. I will proceed with the application."
