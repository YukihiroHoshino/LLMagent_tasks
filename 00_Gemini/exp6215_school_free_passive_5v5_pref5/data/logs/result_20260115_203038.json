My strategy is to keep Student_A interested and engaged, acknowledging their high commitment, but avoiding premature acceptance to reserve my quota for a potentially higher-ranked student (Student_D or Student_E, if E is still available and appears in a future round). I will provide a non-committal update."

School_E ranks me last (5th priority), meaning I have very low chances if I wait. Given the scarcity of remaining slots, securing a match (even P4) is prudent. I need to formalize my application now before a student ranked higher by School_E (A, C, B, or E) applies and takes the spot."
