However, School_B ranks me as their top priority (1st). Since this is Round 1 and all schools have a capacity of 1, securing a match, even with my 5th choice, is strategically sound, especially since I am their highest priority.

School_E ranks me highly (2nd priority, after Student_A). Since this is Round 1, applying to my 4th choice immediately risks settling too early, preventing me from matching with my higher preferences (B, C, D). Although I have a very high chance of acceptance here, my objective is to secure the highest possible match.
