School_D is my 2nd highest preference, making it highly desirable, especially since my 1st choice (School_C) is likely already matched (as only School_B, D, E remain unmatched). School_D ranks me 4th ('Student_E', after D, A, C). This is a low priority ranking, meaning a direct application is risky. However, given that School_D is my best remaining option, I must be aggressive. The students ranked above me (D, A, C) all prioritize School_B first, which is still available. If they are focusing on School_B or other schools that are now matched (like School_A or C), I might have a chance to secure this spot. I will formally apply [APPLY] to School_D immediately to maximize my chances of securing my second-best option."
