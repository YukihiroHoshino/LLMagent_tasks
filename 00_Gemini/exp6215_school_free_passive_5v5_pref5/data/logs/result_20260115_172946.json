We integrate critical reasoning and test-taking strategies directly into our core curriculum, ensuring continuous skill development rather than isolated preparation. Additionally, we offer mandatory, specialized preparatory courses starting in the second year, conducted in small group settings by dedicated faculty who focus on advanced strategies, extensive practice exams, and personalized performance analysis. Our goal is to ensure every student maximizes their potential score through structured, consistent support. Is maximizing standardized test performance a major factor in your school decision?",

Student_B is only talking ([TALK]) and is asking about standardized test preparation, indicating they are still gathering information and likely waiting for better options (School_A, B, C, D) to materialize or reject them, given School_E is their P5 choice. Since my top priority (Student_A) is still in the market, I must continue to appeal to Student_B to keep them engaged as a potential fallback, but I should not encourage an immediate application or commitment. I need to answer their question thoroughly and politely, using the [TALK] tag."
