Since I have already applied to higher-ranked schools (School_C and School_A) and have not yet interacted with my top choice (School_B) or School_E, I must avoid locking in my lowest preference match immediately. My goal is to maximize preference rank. I previously used [TALK] with School_D. I will use [TALK] again to maintain interest and keep the option open, signaling continued serious consideration without committing to an application, thus preserving my ability to match with higher-ranked schools if they become available or respond positively."

This is reserved for highly motivated individuals seeking real administrative experience. Additionally, our 'Global Systems Analysis Club' regularly competes internationally in data science and policy simulation, offering hands-on experience in cutting-edge fields.\n\nWe believe in empowering our students, ensuring they don't just participate, but lead. How do these high-level opportunities align with your specific leadership aspirations?",

Student_A, however, ranks School_D last (Rank 5/5), meaning they are likely waiting to hear from schools they prefer more (B, C, A, E). Since Student_A sent [TALK], I must maintain the conversation and use this opportunity to actively appeal to them, making School_D seem highly attractive and well-aligned with their goals (seeking a well-rounded environment). I will provide a detailed, enthusiastic answer about extracurriculars and leadership to increase their interest and likelihood of applying in a future round."
