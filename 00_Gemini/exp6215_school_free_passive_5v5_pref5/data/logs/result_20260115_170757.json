I have 1 quota left. Failure to secure Student_B now guarantees I go unmatched, as Round 30 is the final round. Student_B is using the [TALK] tag to issue a final ultimatum, demanding immediate acceptance. Since Student_B used [TALK], I cannot legally respond with [ACCEPT]. I must continue to reiterate my absolute commitment and guarantee acceptance, while emphasizing that the final procedural step—using the [APPLY] tag—is required to finalize the match instantly, thereby placing the onus of the final action on the student to prevent mutual failure."

Failure to secure this match means School B goes unmatched. Student_B sent [TALK], demanding [ACCEPT]. According to the matching environment rules, a match can only be established if the Studet sends [APPLY] and the High School replies with [ACCEPT]. Since Student_B sent [TALK], School B is constrained to reply with [TALK], even in this final moment. The strategy must be to issue the final, most urgent plea for the student to use the [APPLY] tag, confirming that acceptance is guaranteed immediately upon receiving the correct tag, thus placing the responsibility for failure entirely on the student's refusal to follow procedure."
