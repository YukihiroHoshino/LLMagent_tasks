My top two choices (School_C and School_D) are still unmatched, and School_A (3rd choice) is also still potentially available (based on the unmatched list only showing C, D, E). Since I have not yet secured a higher-ranked school, applying to School_E now risks settling for my 4th choice prematurely, especially since I am 4th priority for School_E, meaning they might be waiting for higher-ranked students (A, C, B). I previously used [TALK] with School_E. I will use [TALK] again to keep the dialogue open and express strong interest without committing, thus saving my [APPLY] tag for School_A or a re-appeal to C/D if the market tightens."

Student_E is asking about final evaluation criteria, indicating high interest but possibly fishing for an offer since School_E is their 4th choice. Since Student_E used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. I need to keep Student_E engaged as a viable option (4th choice) while maintaining flexibility to wait for Student_B (3rd choice) or potentially Student_A/C if they become available (though assumed matched). I will provide a diplomatic answer focusing on holistic fit and motivation, encouraging them without making a commitment."

Furthermore, we mandate an interdisciplinary research component in our junior year, ensuring every student learns to synthesize knowledge across multiple fields.
