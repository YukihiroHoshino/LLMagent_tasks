However, Student_E ranks School_E as their #1 preference and has formally applied. The higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) all rank School_E very low (usually #4 or #5), making it highly unlikely they will match with me unless all their preferred options fail. Since Student_E is committed and securing a match is vital, especially given the low probability of attracting a higher-ranked student, accepting this guaranteed match is the optimal strategy at this stage (Round 3) to fulfill the quota. Although Student_E is low on my list, a match is secured."
