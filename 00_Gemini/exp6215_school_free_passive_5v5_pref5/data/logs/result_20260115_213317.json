However, all other schools (School_C, School_D, School_A, School_E) are presumably matched, as School_B is the only one listed as unmatched. Therefore, School_B is the best available outcome. Furthermore, School_B ranks me as its #1 candidate. I have applied seven times previously without success, which is unusual given the priority alignment and the current market stage. Despite the failed attempts, in a negotiation environment where stability is guaranteed (I am their top pick, they are my last resort but only option), I must continue to apply to finalize the match. I will reiterate the definitive nature of the application, emphasizing the closing market and the guaranteed stability."
