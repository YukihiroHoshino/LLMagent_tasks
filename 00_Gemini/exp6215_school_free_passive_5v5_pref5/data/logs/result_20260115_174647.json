My list is: E (#1), D (#2 - likely matched), A (#3), B (#4), C (#5 - likely matched). Student_A (Rank #3) is currently applying. Student_E (Rank #1) is still available, but I don't know when or if I will be paired with them, and other schools (like School_B) prioritize E highly. Rejecting Student_A to hold out for Student_E carries significant risk of ending up unmatched or settling for a lower rank (like Student_B, whom I already rejected once). Since Student_A is a high-ranking candidate (Rank #3), securing this match now is the most prudent strategy to fulfill the quota successfully, guaranteeing a high-quality match."
