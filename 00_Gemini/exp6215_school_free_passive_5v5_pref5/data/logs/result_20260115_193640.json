Although School_C ranks two students higher than me (Student_B and Student_C), there is no guarantee those students will apply to School_C immediately or that I will get another chance to apply to School_C later.

Student_C has applied immediately in Round 1, indicating strong interest (School_D is C's 3rd choice). My top two priorities (Student_D and Student_A) both rank School_D 5th, making it highly unlikely they will apply here, especially early on.
