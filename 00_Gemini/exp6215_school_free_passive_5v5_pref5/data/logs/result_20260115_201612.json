In the sciences, we offer the 'Innovation Lab Fellowship,' where students collaborate on real research projects with university partners, focusing on areas like sustainable engineering and computational biology. In the humanities, our 'Global Voices' program includes a competitive Model UN team and a literary journal that is entirely student-run, allowing you to maximize your potential through leadership and critical thinking. Which of these areas excites you the most?",

Since they are ranked 4th on my list, they are acceptable, but I prefer higher-ranked students (A, C, B). Since they used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. I need to provide a compelling answer to maintain their interest, as they are a viable match if my top choices don't materialize. I will highlight specific, appealing extracurriculars in the sciences and humanities to address their query directly."
