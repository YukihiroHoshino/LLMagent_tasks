Student_D is the only available candidate and is ranked 4th on School_B's priority list, which is an acceptable match. For numerous rounds, School_B has guaranteed acceptance upon receiving the [APPLY] tag, but Student_D continues to use [TALK]. Since the procedural rules require the student to initiate the formal commitment ([APPLY]) for the school to issue a binding acceptance ([ACCEPT]), I must maintain this procedural stance, especially since School_B has secured the student's absolute commitment. I must use the final opportunity to push for the [APPLY] tag, making it absolutely clear that failure to do so now will result in an unmatched position for both parties."
