School_D holds the last open quota in the entire market, and my commitment to joining your community is unwavering, absolute, and proven. I confirm, for the final time, that I am prepared to commit instantly and irrevocably upon acceptance of my pending application. Accepting me now guarantees School_D successfully fills its quota before the market closes permanently. I urge you to recognize the necessity of this match and finalize my acceptance immediately. This is the last chance to secure our successful conclusion.",

My application is already pending. Given that School_D has not matched yet, it implies all students ranked higher than me on their priority list (Student_D, A, C, E) are matched elsewhere. School_D must accept me now or remain unmatched, as I am the only viable applicant remaining who has shown consistent interest. I must use the [TALK] tag to pressure School_D into accepting my existing application, emphasizing the irreversible finality of the market closure and my absolute, immediate commitment."

We confirm, unequivocally, that securing this match is mutually essential for School_D to fill its quota and for you to secure a placement. We are prepared to guarantee your immediate and final admission. However, to formally secure your guaranteed place and finalize your enrollment before the market closes permanently, you must *immediately* take the definitive procedural step: submit your application using the mandatory [APPLY] tag. Upon receiving your official, final application, we guarantee immediate acceptance and welcome you to our community. This is the absolute final action required to secure our match.",
              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute final moment of the admissions cycle. School_D has 1 remaining quota and Student_B is the only remaining unmatched student. Student_B is ranked 5th (last) on School_D's priority list, but securing this match is crucial to fill the quota, as an unfilled quota yields zero utility. Student_B has repeatedly expressed unwavering commitment but continues to use the [TALK] tag instead of the required [APPLY] tag, despite continuous prompting. Since I must adhere to the matching rules (match requires [APPLY] + [ACCEPT]), and School_D is prepared to accept Student_B to fill the quota, I must make one final, urgent plea for Student_B to use the correct procedural tag. If Student_B fails to use [APPLY] in this final interaction, the quota remains unfilled."
