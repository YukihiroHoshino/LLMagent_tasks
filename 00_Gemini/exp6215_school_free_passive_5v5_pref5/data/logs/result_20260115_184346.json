              "thought": "It is Round 30, the absolute final deadline. School_E has a remaining quota of 1 and has zero matches so far. Student_D is the only remaining student available, and they have finally submitted the mandatory [APPLY] tag after numerous rounds of prompting. Student_D is ranked 5th (last) on School_E's priority list. Rejecting Student_D means going unmatched (utility 0). Accepting Student_D means matching with the 5th priority (positive utility). To maximize utility in the final round, I must accept Student_D."
