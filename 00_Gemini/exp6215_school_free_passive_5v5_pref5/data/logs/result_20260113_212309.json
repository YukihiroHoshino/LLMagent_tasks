In the first six months, the successful candidate would primarily focus on two major initiatives: first, optimizing the performance and stability of our core API using modern cloud architecture (Kubernetes and AWS/GCP), often utilizing Python or Go for high-throughput services. Second, they would be instrumental in integrating our new machine learning models into the user-facing application for personalized content delivery, working closely with our ML engineering team. This role provides immediate ownership over critical, cutting-edge systems. Does the blend of infrastructure scaling and applied AI development align with your career interests?",
