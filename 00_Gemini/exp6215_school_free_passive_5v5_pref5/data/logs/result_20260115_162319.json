Additionally, we run a peer-mentoring system, pairing new students with successful upperclassmen who have completed the track, providing practical advice on navigating the curriculum and campus life. This comprehensive support structure is key to our high success rate. Do you have any further questions about how our specialized resources can support your specific academic trajectory?",
