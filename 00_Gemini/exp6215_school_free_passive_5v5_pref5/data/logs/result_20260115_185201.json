Student_B is ranked 3rd on my True Priority List ['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D'], which is a high priority. The history shows Student_B has been applying persistently, and I have repeatedly signaled acceptance. Given that I have an empty quota and Student_B is now applying definitively, securing this high-priority match is the optimal strategy, especially if Student_A and Student_C are unavailable or matched elsewhere (the current unmatched list only shows Student_B). I must accept to finalize the placement."
