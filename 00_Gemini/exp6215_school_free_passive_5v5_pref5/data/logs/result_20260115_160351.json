Crucially, School_D ranks me as their top priority (P1). Since the market is nearing closure (only two schools, School_A and School_D, remain unmatched) and my higher preferences (P1, P2, P4) are already matched elsewhere, securing a match is paramount. Although School_A (P3) is still available, I have already applied there twice without success. Applying to School_D guarantees an immediate, stable match (P5), which is preferable to risking being unmatched. I will formally apply now."

Given that School_D (my 2nd choice) has not yet accepted my previous applications (and I am 4th on their priority list), securing a match at School_A (3rd choice) is a highly reliable strategy, especially since the market is moving quickly (Round 4) and my top choice (C) might be matched already.
