To successfully conclude this process and prevent the absolute risk of an unfilled quota in the final round, you must take the final procedural step required by the system: submit your formal application using the required [APPLY] tag now.

Student_E continues to send [TALK] messages demanding acceptance of a 'standing application' but refuses to use the required [APPLY] tag, which is necessary to formally conclude the match under system rules. My objective is to secure this match (Rank 4 is better than 0).
