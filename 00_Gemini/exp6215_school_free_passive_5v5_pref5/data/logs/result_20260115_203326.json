Our prior conversations have strongly confirmed that your intellectual curiosity and collaborative spirit align perfectly with the core values and rigorous environment we cultivate at School_D. We are pleased to inform you that we formally [ACCEPT] your application. We look forward to welcoming you to our community!",

School_D has its full quota of 1 available. Although Student_D (P1) is still available, Student_A ranks School_D last (P5). Accepting Student_A now secures a high-priority match who is applying, mitigating the risk that A matches elsewhere or that D never applies or matches elsewhere first. Given the high priority and the immediate application, securing Student_A is the optimal decision to fulfill the quota with a top candidate."
