I understand the competitive nature of the process, but I am now submitting this application as a final, definitive commitment to accept immediately. I look forward to finalizing our match.",
              "thought": "I am Student_D. School_E is my 4th preference, which is still highly desirable given the limited options. All other schools (A, B, C, D) are matched, meaning School_E is the only remaining open school, and I am highly likely the only remaining unmatched student. Although School_E ranks me last (5th), they prefer matching with me over remaining unmatched. I have previously applied multiple times without success, but the current market situation dictates that School_E must accept my application if they wish to fill their quota. I must submit a formal [APPLY] to secure this match, which is the highest possible outcome remaining."

Your repeated applications and profound dedication to School_E have not gone unnoticed. Given the progression of the market and after a final, comprehensive review of all candidates, we are pleased to confirm that your profile aligns with our strategic needs for our final available position. We formally accept your application. Welcome to School_E!",
              "thought": "Student_D is the lowest ranked student (5/5) on my True Priority List: ['Student_A', 'Student_C', 'Student_B', 'Student_E', 'Student_D']. In previous rounds, I rejected Student_D, hoping for higher-ranked students (A, C, B, E). However, the current situation indicates that only Student_D remains unmatched. If I reject Student_D now, I risk failing to fill my quota (1). Matching with my Rank 5 student is significantly better than remaining unmatched. Therefore, given the urgency and the apparent closure of the market for higher-ranked candidates, I must accept Student_D's final application."
