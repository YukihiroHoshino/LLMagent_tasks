I have already formally applied in Round 3 and have been aggressively appealing since then. Given that the market is closing (Round 28 of 30), I must continue to press for acceptance, as remaining unmatched is worse than matching with School_D. The message must emphasize the absolute finality of the round and the guaranteed quota fulfillment School_D achieves by accepting me now."
