Although Student_D is demanding an [ACCEPT] response while sending [TALK], I must adhere to the protocol: I can only issue [ACCEPT] if the student first submits [APPLY]. I must reiterate the guaranteed acceptance and demand the final required action from Student_D to conclude the market successfully."
