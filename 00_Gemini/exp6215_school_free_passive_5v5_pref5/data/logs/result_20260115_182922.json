We truly value your persistent interest and the commitment you have shown to School_D, especially considering our previous communications regarding the strategic limitations on our quota. Given that you have maintained such a high regard for our institution, could you share how your specific academic goals align with our 'Future Leaders Program' now, or perhaps describe any new insights you’ve gained about our learning environment since our last discussion?",

School_D has previously rejected Student_B twice, despite Student_B stating School_D was their highest priority among remaining schools. School_D currently has its full quota (1) remaining and must prioritize higher-ranked students (D, A, C, E). Since Student_B sent a [TALK] message, I must reply with [TALK]. The strategy is to continue engaging politely, acknowledging their persistent interest and our history, but avoiding any language that suggests an imminent acceptance, thus preserving the quota for higher priorities who might still be available in the market."

We deeply appreciate your unwavering commitment. However, as we have previously communicated, the constraints imposed by our limited quota require us to adhere strictly to our institutional priorities.

The objective is to match the highest possible priority student. Since students D, A, C, and E are ranked higher and are presumably still available in the market (otherwise School_D would have accepted B earlier), I must reject Student_B to preserve the quota for a better match. This is the third time Student_B has applied, so the rejection must be firm but diplomatic, reiterating the strategic constraints previously communicated."
