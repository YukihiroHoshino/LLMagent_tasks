We view independent research and interdisciplinary collaboration not as extracurriculars, but as core components of our curriculum, especially within our specialized tracks.\n\nTo support student initiatives, we have two key structural mechanisms:\n\n1. **The School_E Research Incubator (SRI):** This is a dedicated program providing mentorship and resources for student-led research, regardless of the track chosen. Students pursuing independent projects are paired with a faculty mentor who specializes in their chosen field (e.g., a STEM student working on a robotics project gets an engineering mentor; a Global Humanities student researching policy gets a political science specialist). The SRI also offers access to a dedicated budget for materials, conference attendance, and publication support.\n\n2. **The Annual Interdisciplinary Capstone:** All students, typically starting in their second year, are required to complete a Capstone project that bridges two or more fields of study. For example, a student in the Advanced STEM Pathway might collaborate with a student in the Creative Arts & Media Program to design and market a sustainable technology solution. This structure forces interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, supported by joint faculty advising from different departments.\n\nIn essence, we don't just allow independent work; we build the infrastructure and dedicated time into the schedule to ensure ambitious students like yourself can execute high-level research and interdisciplinary projects with professional-grade support.
