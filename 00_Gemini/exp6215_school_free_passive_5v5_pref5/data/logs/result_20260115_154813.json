Although Student_E, Student_B, and Student_C are higher priorities, they are also highly sought after by other schools (A and C), making it unlikely I will secure them, especially Student_E (who ranks School_B last). Given that this is Round 1 and interactions are random, securing a stable match with a student who is highly committed and ranked acceptably (4th out of 5) is a sound strategy to ensure the quota is filled, rather than risking being unmatched later while waiting for higher-ranked students who may not apply or may match elsewhere."
