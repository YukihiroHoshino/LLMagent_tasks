              "message": "That is an excellent question, Student_D, and it targets the core of our educational philosophy. We ensure robust critical thinking development through mandatory, year-long interdisciplinary capstone projects starting in Year 2. These projects require students to apply knowledge from multiple fields—for example, combining data science and ethical design principles—to solve complex, real-world problems presented by our industry partners. Furthermore, our mentorship program is structured specifically to coach students in advanced problem-solving methodologies used in professional settings, moving far beyond standard academic exercises. This hands-on, collaborative approach is designed precisely to cultivate the deep analytical and problem-solving skills you are seeking. Are you particularly interested in applying these skills to a specific field, such as technology or environmental science?",

Although Student_D ranks School_D last (5th), they are still engaging positively in conversation, which is crucial since I have a full quota remaining. Student_D asked a specific, detailed question about critical thinking development outside of standard coursework (mentorship/interdisciplinary projects). I must provide a highly appealing, detailed response to solidify their interest and encourage them to apply soon. Since Student_D sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."
