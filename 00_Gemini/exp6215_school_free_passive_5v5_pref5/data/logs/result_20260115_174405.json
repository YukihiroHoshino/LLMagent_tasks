This is a mandatory, interdisciplinary initiative where student teams are given a major, real-world challenge (e.g., sustainable urban development or rapid technological disruption). Crucially, the parameters and necessary resources for the project are intentionally shifted or restricted mid-cycle, forcing teams to completely pivot their strategies, often multiple times. This isn't just about solving a problem; it's about demonstrating the ability to rapidly assimilate new constraints and redesign solutions under pressure. It's a key measure of the adaptability we value. How do you typically react when the fundamental assumptions of a task you are undertaking suddenly change?",

The goal is to maintain the conversation flow and keep Student_C engaged as a potential fallback, without committing or actively appealing, as they are not a high-priority target. I will answer their question about student-led initiatives to gather more data on their fit and continue the relationship building."
