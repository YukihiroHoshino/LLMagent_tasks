However, in this round, I am paired with School_A, where I am guaranteed a match if I apply, securing my 3rd preference. Given the uncertainty of securing P1 or P2 in future random pairings, securing a P3 match where I am the top priority is a strategic safety net. I will apply now to lock in this favorable match."

For research, we strongly support independent academic inquiry through our 'Faculty Research Sponsorship Program.' This program connects motivated students directly with faculty members to pursue specialized, year-long research projects, often resulting in publication opportunities in our school journal or presentations at regional conferences.
