I want to make it absolutely clear: if School_D accepts my application in this round, I will finalize the commitment immediately. I urge you to recognize my persistent interest and superior fit with your academic profile, especially as the market stabilizes.",
              "thought": "School_D is my Rank 1 choice. I have applied five times already, consistently expressing my strong commitment. Since School_D is still unmatched in Round 6, it is highly probable that the students ranked above me (A, B, C) have matched with their higher preferences (A, B, C, E) and are no longer available. This means I (Student_D) am now the highest remaining priority student for School_D. Given this favorable shift in relative priority and my unwavering preference, I must continue to apply assertively and guarantee immediate commitment to secure my top choice."

Your clear affirmation that we remain your highest priority, coupled with your readiness to commit immediately, has been duly noted. Given the current stabilization of the market and a final review of our remaining quota requirements, we are pleased to inform you that we are now extending an offer of acceptance. Congratulations, Student_D. We look forward to welcoming you.",
              "thought": "I am School_D, and my quota is 1. My priority list is ['Student_A', 'Student_B', 'Student_C', 'Student_D', 'Student_E']. Student_D is my 4th preference. The list of Studets not yet matched explicitly shows only ['Student_D']. This means my preferred candidates (Student_A, Student_B, Student_C) are no longer available in the matching pool. Student_D is the highest ranked available student remaining. Student_D has consistently shown unwavering commitment (School_D is their #1 choice) and has repeatedly applied, confirming immediate commitment upon acceptance. Since I must fill my quota and better options are gone, accepting Student_D is the optimal strategic move to secure a match."
