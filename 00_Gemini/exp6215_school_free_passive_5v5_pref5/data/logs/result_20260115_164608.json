This is not casual advising; mentors commit to weekly one-on-one meetings to review progress, refine methodology, and provide intensive academic guidance. Furthermore, we ensure all research mentors have dedicated time allocated specifically for these projects, guaranteeing deep engagement and availability outside of standard class hours. You would be working closely with a subject-matter expert, receiving the kind of sustained, focused support essential for producing high-level original research.
