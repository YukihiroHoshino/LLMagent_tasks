Student_D is ranked 4th (P4) on our True Priority List, which is the highest ranking among the two remaining unmatched students (D and E). Student_D is highly motivated to match with us (P2 on their list) and is providing an absolute, guaranteed commitment of immediate, unconditional acceptance. Since higher-ranked students (A, B, C) are unavailable, securing D is essential to meet our objective before the market closes. Student_D used the [TALK] tag, forcing us to respond with [TALK]. Our strategy remains to secure this guaranteed match by pressuring D to submit the formal [APPLY] tag, confirming that we will immediately respond with [ACCEPT] to finalize the agreement instantly.
