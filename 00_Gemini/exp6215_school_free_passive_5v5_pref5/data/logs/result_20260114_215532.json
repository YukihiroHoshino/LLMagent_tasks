It is Round 8, and I must secure a match. School_E is my lowest preferred option, but it is still on my list, making it better than remaining unmatched. I have previously engaged in [TALK] conversations with School_E to gather information. Since the market is closing and School_D has not responded favorably despite repeated aggressive attempts, I must now formalize my interest in School_E to secure a position. I rank higher than Student_E at School_E, so applying now ensures I secure the spot if School_E decides to match based on available candidates."

Since School_D is still unmatched, and most higher-priority students (A, B, C, D) are likely matched elsewhere (as A, B, C schools are matched), School_D is likely ready to consider me, their lowest priority applicant. To ensure I secure a placement rather than risk being unmatched, I must push for acceptance at School_D while still holding out hope for School_E (which I cannot interact with this round).
