This ensures every student receives personalized attention and allows for highly interactive, Socratic-style teaching. Furthermore, collaborative learning is not incidental; it is the foundation of our curriculum. Across all subjects, we utilize a project-based learning model where students consistently work in small teams on complex, interdisciplinary challenges. For instance, in our integrated science program, students collaborate on semester-long research projects requiring them to present findings to external experts, fostering critical teamwork and communication skills essential for future success. This structure maximizes engagement and ensures you are actively building practical skills alongside knowledge.",
