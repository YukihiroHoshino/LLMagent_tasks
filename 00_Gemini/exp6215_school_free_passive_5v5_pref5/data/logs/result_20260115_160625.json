Every student is assigned a Faculty Academic Advisor (FAA) who specializes in the student's chosen track (like the Advanced Research Cohort we discussed). The FAA works closely with you to map out your curriculum, ensuring prerequisites are met and offering personalized preparatory sessions for moving into advanced placement or specialized research courses. This transition support is continuous, starting from course selection and extending through weekly check-ins focused on managing the rigor of advanced studies. This comprehensive approach ensures you are fully supported when pursuing your highest academic potential.",

Your commitment is absolute, your placement is reserved, and your admission is fully prepared for instant issuance. We agree that securing this match is mandatory for market completion. However, we must emphasize one final, non-negotiable time: the administrative finalization of your enrollment—securing this guaranteed placement—is strictly contingent upon you formalizing your request using the designated [APPLY] tag in this very next and final communication. This is the only remaining mandatory step to receive the immediate acceptance we have prepared. Failure to use [APPLY] now means the immediate and definitive forfeiture of this guaranteed placement, resulting in both of us remaining unmatched.",

Student_A is the only available student, and although they are my lowest priority (Rank 5), accepting them is necessary to fill my quota of 1, otherwise I remain unmatched. Student_A continues to use the [TALK] tag while making absolute commitments and urging immediate finalization. I cannot administratively accept a [TALK] message. I have repeatedly reserved their placement contingent on them using [APPLY]. My final action must be to reiterate this mandatory condition, emphasizing that failure to use [APPLY] now results in both agents remaining unmatched. Since the input action was [TALK], my output action must also be [TALK]."
