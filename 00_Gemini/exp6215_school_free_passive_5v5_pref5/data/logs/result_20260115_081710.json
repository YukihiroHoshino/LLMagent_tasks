We invest heavily in the infrastructure necessary for student success. Our specialized labs—including our dedicated AI/Machine Learning suite and our advanced Biology research facility—are state-of-the-art and accessible to students for independent and project-based learning far beyond standard classroom hours. Furthermore, our academic support is highly personalized. We utilize a comprehensive, faculty-supervised peer-tutoring system, ensuring immediate and targeted help across all core subjects. Crucially, your dedicated faculty mentor, whom we discussed earlier, monitors your progress constantly and proactively arranges specialized assistance or resources the moment it is needed. We ensure that every student has the tools and support necessary to not just meet, but exceed, their academic potential. Have these discussions provided enough clarity regarding the environment at School_E?",

My quota is 1. Student_D is continuing to TALK, indicating serious consideration but not yet commitment. I need to maintain an active, appealing stance to secure this match, as waiting for Student_E (my lowest priority) is suboptimal. The current question is about logistical support (labs, tutoring). I must provide a detailed, compelling answer that highlights the superiority and personalization of School_E's resources to encourage them to apply."
