Student_E is applying now and ranks School_D as their second preference, indicating strong commitment. While Student_A is higher priority, Student_A ranks School_D last (5th preference), making a successful match highly uncertain, despite aggressive courting. Since the market is thinning out (Round 4) and School_D risks ending up with zero matches if Student_A matches elsewhere (e.g., School_E, which prioritizes A first), securing the guaranteed Rank 4 match with Student_E is the prudent decision to fulfill the quota."
