Since the market is closing and only A and E remain, I must secure a match soon. Student_E is higher priority than Student_A. Student_A is currently sending a [TALK] message, pressuring for an acceptance based on their previous application. I must reply with [TALK]. I should not commit to Student_A (my lowest choice) yet, especially since Student_E is still unmatched.
