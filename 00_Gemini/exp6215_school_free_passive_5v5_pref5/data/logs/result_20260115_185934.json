Student_D's current message suggests that the market is severely restricted and that they are likely the highest-priority student still available and applying to School B.

Since Student_D is still on my priority list (Rank 4), accepting them now is a necessary compromise to secure a high-preference student who is ready to commit, rather than risking an empty quota waiting for agents who may already be matched."
