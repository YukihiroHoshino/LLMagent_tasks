While our selection criteria were initially focused on specific profile requirements, the movement in the market has clarified the optimal pairing for School_D. Your proven enthusiasm and repeated commitment confirm your dedication. We are pleased to formally accept your application, finalizing our match.",

I have previously rejected Student_B three times hoping to secure a higher-ranked student. However, the current situation indicates that the list of unmatched students is ['Student_B']. This implies that my preferred candidates (D, A, C, E) are likely matched elsewhere. Since Student_B is still on my priority list, accepting them is preferable to leaving my single quota unfilled. Given the market consolidation, the strategy shifts from seeking the best possible match to securing the best *available* match."
