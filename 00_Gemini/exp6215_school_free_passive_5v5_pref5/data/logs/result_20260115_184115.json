Since School_E is preferable, I need to stall School_D without withdrawing interest, as School_D represents a guaranteed match if I need it later. I will use [TALK] again to maintain contact and keep School_D as a backup while hoping to engage with School_E in the next round."

For candidates who have engaged thoroughly with us, such as yourself, we are prepared to offer a decision within 24 hours of receiving a formal application. Enrollment deadlines for accepted students are communicated immediately upon acceptance to secure their place, as our remaining quota is limited. We are highly enthusiastic about your potential fit at School_D. Are there any other aspects of our program that we haven't covered yet, or perhaps any specific details about the application process itself, that we can clarify for you?",

We have engaged in several rounds of conversation, and Student_D is now asking about administrative timelines (application review and enrollment deadlines).

I need to provide the requested information clearly and use this opportunity to encourage them to submit a formal application, emphasizing speed and limited availability without sounding desperate."

School_E's priority list puts me (Student_E) as the 4th preference, ahead of Student_D (5th preference).
