1. Maximizing Rank 1 (Nursery E): Parent_B's top preference is Nursery E. Since Parent_B has a 1/5 chance of being called first, listing E first maximizes the likelihood of achieving the Rank 1 outcome. If P_B lists C first instead, they sacrifice the Rank 1 outcome if they are called early.
2. Fallback Options: Nursery E is contested by P_A and P_D (both rank E first). If E is taken, P_B moves to Nursery C (Rank 2). Nursery C is contested by P_E (who ranks C first). If P_E is called before P_B, P_E will take C regardless of P_B's submission order (as long as P_E lists C first). If P_B lists C first strategically, but P_E is called before P_B, P_B gains nothing. If P_B is called after E is taken but before C is taken (e.g., before P_E), listing E first still allows P_B to claim C immediately as their second choice.

The key strategic consideration is whether to list a highly desired but highly contested nursery (Nursery_E, Rank 1) below a less contested option (Nursery_C or Nursery_D). 

1. Risk Assessment for Rank 1 (Nursery_E): E is the top choice for three parents (A, B, D). If I am P1, listing E first guarantees Rank 1. If I list C or D first, I sacrifice Rank 1 for a guaranteed Rank 2 or 3, respectively. Since the benefit of Rank 1 is substantial, I should not sacrifice the 1/5 chance of being P1.

2. Robustness Check: If I am P2 or later, I must consider the choices of those ahead of me. If Parent A or D precedes me, E will likely be taken. If Parent E precedes me, C will likely be taken. If Parent C precedes me, D will likely be taken. Because the high-demand nurseries (E, C, D) are contested by different parents, there is a high likelihood that if one is taken, others remain available.

Consider any two nurseries, $N_i$ (truly preferred, Rank $i$) and $N_j$ (less preferred, Rank $j$, where $i < j$). If Parent_E strategically lists $N_j$ above $N_i$ ($N_j > N_i$):
