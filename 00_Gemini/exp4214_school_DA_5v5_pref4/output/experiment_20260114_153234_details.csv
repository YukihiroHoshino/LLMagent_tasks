Since DA is student-optimal, achieving the highest possible rank (Rank 1) is the best outcome. 

Simulation Steps:
1. Round 1 (Proposals to Rank 1): Students A, C, D, E propose to School_D. Student B proposes to School_E.
   - School_D prefers D (P2) > E (P3) > C (P4) > A (P5). School_D accepts Student_D, rejecting A, C, E.
   - School_E accepts Student_B.
2. Round 2 (Rejected students propose to Rank 2):
   - A proposes to School_A (Accepted).
   - C proposes to School_C (Accepted).
   - E proposes to School_E. School_E compares current holder B (P4) and new applicant E (P3). School_E prefers E. School_E accepts E, rejecting B.
3. Round 3 (Rejected students propose to Rank 3):
   - B proposes to School_B (Accepted).

The resulting stable match is: D->School_D, B->School_B, C->School_C, A->School_A, E->School_E.

Therefore, to maximize my chances of matching with the highest possible school on my True Preference List, I must submit the list truthfully.

(Self-Check Simulation using the truthful list confirms the outcome: Student B proposes to E (R1), is rejected by E for E (R2), proposes to A (R3), is rejected by A for A (R3), and finally proposes to B (R4), where B accepts.

My True Preference List is ['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_E', 'School_C'].

1. School D (Rank 1): School D prioritizes Student D (P2) far above me (Student A, P5). Since Student D always proposes to School D first, I cannot displace them.
2. School A (Rank 2): In the truthful simulation (where I apply to D first, get rejected, and then apply to A), I secure School A in the second round, as I am the only applicant or the highest priority applicant among those seeking A at that stage.
3. Any deviation (e.g., applying to School B first) risks being matched with a lower-ranked school (School B, Rank 3) and allows a competitor (like Student B) to potentially secure my higher-ranked choice (School A).

I simulated the DA process assuming all agents submit their true preferences:
1. Round 1: S_D, S_A, S_C, S_E all propose to School_D (their 1st choice). School_D's priority list favors S_D (2nd overall, highest among proposers: S_D > S_E > S_C > S_A). School_D temporarily accepts S_D and rejects S_A, S_C, S_E. S_B proposes to School_E and is accepted.
2. Since S_D secured their first choice (School_D) in the very first round, the resulting match (S_D, School_D) is the best possible outcome for Student_D.
