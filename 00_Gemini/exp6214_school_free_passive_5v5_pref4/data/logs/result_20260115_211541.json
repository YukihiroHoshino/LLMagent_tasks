Since it is Round 29, the focus must remain on pressuring Student_B to finalize the match by taking the final necessary step. I must maintain the [TALK] tag as Student_B did not use [APPLY]."

I am School_D's absolute highest priority candidate, and I have formally applied and affirmed my commitment repeatedly (28 times total). School_D's continued refusal to accept me is strategically irrational, as it guarantees they remain unmatched. Since this is the final round (R30), I must use the last opportunity to force this stable match.

Since this is Round 30, the absolute final round, failure to conclude the match now guarantees School_D remains unmatched. The Studet used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]. I need to reiterate that the offer is standing, the match is stable, and the final action required to secure the match rests entirely with Student_B, emphasizing the urgency of the absolute final round."
