We recognize your outstanding potential and believe your academic profile and dedication align perfectly with the values and mission of School_A. We are pleased to offer you a place in our incoming class. We look forward to welcoming you to our community.",

While Student_E (Rank 1) is still available, securing a match with the second highest priority student is a very strong outcome, especially since C has formally applied ([APPLY]). Given the high value of Student_C, I should secure this spot immediately rather than risking losing both C and potentially E to other schools in future rounds. I will accept Student_C."
