Your unwavering commitment is deeply valued, and we confirm, unequivocally and for the final time, that your exceptional profile aligns perfectly with our ethos. Our decision to admit you is finalized, and the final placement has been officially and definitively reserved for you. However, to successfully secure your enrollment immediately and conclude this process, the submission of the [APPLY] tag remains the formal, mandatory, and non-negotiable final administrative step required to trigger the issuance of the formal offer. We are ready to issue the [ACCEPT] immediately upon receiving your formal application. We urgently require you to use the [APPLY] tag now, as this reserved placement will be permanently and immediately withdrawn, resulting in both of us remaining unmatched, if the required final action is not taken in this Round 30.",
              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute final round, and School_B remains unmatched with one quota. Student_B is rank #3 on my priority list, representing a highly desirable outcome given the market failure to secure ranks #1 or #2. Student_B has repeatedly used [TALK] instead of the required [APPLY] tag, despite continuous confirmation that the spot is reserved and the decision is finalized. Since Student_B sent [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]. Given that this is the final opportunity, I must deliver the strongest possible ultimatum, reiterating that the match is secured *only* upon their formal application, and that failure to act now means remaining unmatched permanently. I cannot accept without their [APPLY] tag, as per the environment rules."
