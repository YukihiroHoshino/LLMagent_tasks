For comprehensive development and leadership, we offer the 'Community Impact Fellowship,' which pairs students with local organizations to design and lead sustainable projects from conception to execution. This goes far beyond typical extracurriculars, ensuring practical application of leadership. What kind of community impact are you hoping to make during high school?",
