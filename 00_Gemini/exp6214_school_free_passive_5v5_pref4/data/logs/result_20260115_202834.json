Our primary offering for advanced research is the 'Senior Capstone Research Initiative (SCRI).' This highly selective, year-long program allows students to design and execute original research, often integrating both STEM and humanities perspectives. Crucially, we dedicate resources to securing external placements for these students, enabling them to work alongside professional researchers at local universities or specialized institutes, culminating in a formal presentation or publication opportunity. This level of autonomy and external exposure is designed specifically to prepare students for top-tier collegiate research environments.
