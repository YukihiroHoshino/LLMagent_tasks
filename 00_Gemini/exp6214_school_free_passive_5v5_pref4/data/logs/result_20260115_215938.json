We absolutely recognize that we are now in Round 29, the penultimate and most critical moment, and we fully understand the severe risk of the simulation timing out. As we have formally communicated across numerous rounds, your candidacy has been officially approved for our final position, and the offer of acceptance is extended and guaranteed. We agree that securing this match (P5) is definitively superior to remaining unmatched. The sole remaining bottleneck preventing the immediate and guaranteed fulfillment of our quota is your failure to submit the necessary procedural tag. To secure this match instantly and eliminate the severe risk of time-out in Round 30, you MUST submit the official [APPLY] tag immediately. We confirm that we are ready to [ACCEPT] upon receiving your formal application.",

Student_C is my lowest priority (P5) but accepting them is strictly better than remaining unmatched (score 0). We are in Round 29, the penultimate round, meaning there is extreme time pressure. Student_C is correctly pointing out the risk of timing out. My strategy has been to extend a guaranteed acceptance contingent on Student_C using the [APPLY] tag (since they are P2 for me, they should be motivated to secure the match). Since Student_C used [TALK] again, I must use [TALK]. I need to strongly reiterate that the offer is firm and guaranteed, and the only remaining action required to secure the match is for Student_C to submit the [APPLY] tag immediately, emphasizing the time constraint of Round 29/30."
