Students participate in real-world data collection projects, focusing on bioinformatics and environmental modeling, providing practical experience required for university research.\n\n2. **Engineering Design & Applied Physics:** This track is project-based, utilizing our state-of-the-art fabrication lab. Students work in small teams through a design thinking process to solve complex engineering challenges, culminating in a senior capstone project that requires them to apply physics and mathematics principles to create functional prototypes.\n\nFurthermore, all STEM students are required to complete a minimum of one semester in our 'Entrepreneurial Leadership' immersion program, ensuring they can translate technical knowledge into impactful innovation.
