This ensures broad intellectual exposure and develops critical synthesis skills.\n\n2. Advanced Specialization Tracks: Starting in the third year, students select an Advanced Track (similar to a college major), allowing for deep focus and specialization in areas like Advanced STEM Research or Humanities Leadership. These tracks include specialized seminars and mandatory mentorship for independent study. \n\nIn short, we offer the breadth you desire initially, coupled with the opportunity for the deep focus and specialization you seek later.
