Your engagement during our previous discussions and the alignment of your academic profile with our specialized program opportunities have made a strong impression on our admissions committee. We believe you would be an exceptional addition to the School_A community. We are delighted to formally offer you admission. [ACCEPT]",

We have a remaining quota of 1. Although Student_E is ranked 1st, securing the 2nd highest priority student early in Round 4 is an excellent outcome and reduces the risk of remaining unmatched or settling for a lower-ranked student later. Student_C's application follows a positive prior conversation, indicating strong engagement. I will accept this application immediately."

Although I have applied twice previously and was not accepted (likely because School_E is holding out for higher priority students A, D, or E), it remains unmatched. Since only School_A (my #2) and School_E (my #1) are left, securing School_E is paramount. I must use [APPLY] again to confirm my commitment and ensure I am considered if School_E decides to fill its quota this round, especially if their higher priorities have matched elsewhere or remain uninterested."

While we previously paused to evaluate the broader applicant pool, the current market dynamics have clarified our final enrollment needs. We recognize that your dedication and enthusiasm represent a reliable and excellent fit for our remaining position. We are now delighted to formally extend an offer of admission.

The list of unmatched students suggests that my top 3 priorities (A, D, E) are likely matched elsewhere, leaving only Student_B (Rank 4) and Student_C (Rank 5) available. Student_B is the highest ranked available student remaining. Student_B has applied three times, showing unwavering commitment (School_E is B's Rank 1). Given that the market is thinning out (Round 4) and B is the best remaining option, accepting B secures a Rank 4 match, which is much better than holding out for C (Rank 5) or risking being unmatched. I must accept this application."
