Schools C (P2) and E (P3) are already matched, so I cannot pursue them.\n\nSchool_A (P4) is the current target and is still unmatched. Crucially, School_A ranks me (Student_C) as their 2nd priority, behind only Student_E. Given that School_A is still available in Round 4, it is highly likely that Student_E is matched elsewhere. This makes me the highest remaining priority candidate for School_A.\n\nSince School_A is my second-to-last choice, but securing a match is vital, and the chance of acceptance is very high, I must apply immediately to secure P4 rather than risk falling to P5 (School_B) or remaining unmatched.
