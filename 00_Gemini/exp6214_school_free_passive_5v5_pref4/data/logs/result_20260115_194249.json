I previously applied to School_C and followed up with a TALK message, but they remain unmatched and have not accepted me, likely because I am their lowest priority (5th) and they are waiting for higher-ranked students (D, E, A, B). Since three schools (D, E, B) are matched, it is highly probable that at least some of their preferred students are now unavailable. I must maintain pressure. I cannot APPLY again, so I will use [TALK] to strongly reaffirm my dedication and commitment, hoping that they realize their higher priorities are gone and accept their best remaining option (me, Student_C, who is highly committed)."

Your dedication, especially placing us as your top priority among the available institutions, is highly valued. We want to assure you that your candidacy remains active and under serious review. However, given the extraordinarily competitive nature of our applicant pool and the very limited number of positions we still have available, we must proceed meticulously to finalize our decision. We thank you for your continued patience as we work through this final, critical phase of selection.",

Although Student_C is highly committed (ranking School_C as their 2nd choice overall, and claiming it is their top remaining choice), accepting them now would prevent securing higher-priority students (D, E, A, B). Since I have a full quota remaining (1), and the higher priority students are still available, I must maintain flexibility. I have previously rejected C's application and kept them talking. I will continue this strategy by acknowledging their commitment while remaining non-committal about acceptance, citing the competitive review process. Student_C used [TALK], so I must reply with [TALK]."

Student_C's highest remaining preference is likely School_C. If C applies to School_C, I have a chance at School_A.

Since Student_C is still available and ranked higher than Student_A, I must reject Student_A to keep my quota open for Student_C in a subsequent round.

This is a very strong leverage point. Although School_A is P4 for me, securing a guaranteed match is vital, especially since School_C (P2 for me) has been unresponsive across multiple rounds. I have not applied to School_A yet. I will apply now to maximize my chances of securing a P4 match, which is acceptable."

Accepting Student_C secures a highly desirable match immediately. Waiting for my top priority, Student_E (who ranks me last), is too risky, as Student_C is likely to be accepted by one of their higher preferred schools (D, C, E) soon if I reject. Securing Rank 2 is an excellent outcome for the simulation."
