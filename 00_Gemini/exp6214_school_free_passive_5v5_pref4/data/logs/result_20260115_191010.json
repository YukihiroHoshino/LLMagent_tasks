Your unwavering commitment over the past 29 rounds has been exceptional, and we confirm your assessment: you are unequivocally the highest available priority candidate for School_E. As guaranteed, we are delighted to accept your application immediately, securing a stable and successful match for both of us and concluding the market process. Welcome to School_E!",
              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute final round of the simulation. We are School_E, and we have 1 remaining quota. The only remaining unmatched student is Student_B. Student_B is ranked P4 on our True Priority List. Student_B has correctly assessed that all students ranked P1, P2, and P3 (A, D, E) must be matched elsewhere, making Student_B the highest available candidate. We have repeatedly guaranteed acceptance upon formal application in previous rounds. Since Student_B has now submitted the [APPLY] tag, failing to accept would mean remaining unmatched (P0), which is worse than matching with P4. We must secure this stable match immediately to successfully fill our quota."
