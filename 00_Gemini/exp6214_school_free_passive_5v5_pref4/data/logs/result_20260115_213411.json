Applying immediately in Round 1 carries a high risk of rejection, especially since students A, D, E, and B all rank higher than me in School_E's priority. Since School_D (1st) and School_C (2nd) are still available and potentially better matches, I should not commit to my 3rd choice yet.

Student_B has applied and stated School_E is their 1st preference, indicating high stability.
