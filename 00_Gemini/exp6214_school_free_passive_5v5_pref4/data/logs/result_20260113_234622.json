We recognize the current market situation and your decisive readiness to join. Based on our final internal review, we are now prepared to move forward immediately.

The current context indicates that Seeker_E is the 'sole remaining opportunity in the market' and the only Job Seeker not yet matched. While I previously rejected Seeker_E to hold out for higher-ranked candidates (A, B, C, D), those candidates are now presumed matched elsewhere. Seeker_E is applying with absolute commitment and readiness to accept immediately. Since Seeker_E is included in my priority list, accepting this application fulfills my quota and prevents me from ending the simulation unmatched. Given the market reality (Seeker_E is the last available candidate), I must secure the match."
