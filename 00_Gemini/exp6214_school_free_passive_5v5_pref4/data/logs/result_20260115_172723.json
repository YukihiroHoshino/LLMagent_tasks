However, School_E ranks me 2nd overall, meaning I have a very high chance of being accepted if I apply. Since it is Round 1, and I have much higher preferred schools (D, B, C, A) where I also hold strong priority (e.g., #1 at School_B, #2 at School_D), settling for my lowest choice now would be premature and detrimental to my objective.
