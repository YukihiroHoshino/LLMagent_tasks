              "thought": "This is Round 30, the absolute final round, and Student_B is the only remaining unmatched student. Student_B is ranked 3rd on School_B's priority list, making them a highly desirable match, especially compared to remaining unmatched. School_B has repeatedly confirmed that Student_B has been selected and the match is pending only on Student_B using the [APPLY] tag. Since Student_B used [TALK] again, I must respond with [TALK] and make one final, explicit, urgent plea for them to use the formal application tag to secure the match before the market closes permanently. Failing to secure Student_B now means School_B remains unmatched."
