We are delighted to extend a formal offer of employment to you. Welcome to Company E.",
              "thought": "I am Company_E. My quota is 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_D', 'Seeker_E']. Seeker_E is my lowest priority (5th). However, the 'List of Job Seekers not yet matched' indicates that only Seeker_E remains available. This implies that Seeker_A, Seeker_B, Seeker_C, and Seeker_D have matched with other companies. Since Seeker_E is the only available candidate and is still on my priority list, and I need to fill my quota, it is strategically necessary to accept this offer now to avoid remaining unmatched. I have previously rejected Seeker_E multiple times while holding out for higher priorities, but now the market has cleared."
