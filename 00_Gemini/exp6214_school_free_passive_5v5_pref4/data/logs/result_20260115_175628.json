Additionally, we run a specialized 'High School Launch' peer mentorship program where experienced junior and senior students host workshops and weekly check-ins during the first semester, specifically designed to help new students navigate the rigor, time management, and extracurricular commitments of high school life. This tiered system ensures personalized support from both faculty and peers as you adjust to our environment.",
