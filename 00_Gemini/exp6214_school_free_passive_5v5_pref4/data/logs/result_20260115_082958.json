School_E utilizes a dynamic, rotating block schedule. This means classes meet for longer periods (typically 80 minutes) but fewer times per week, allowing for deep dives into subjects and minimizing homework burden by maximizing in-class productivity. Our day usually begins at 8:15 AM.\n\nLunch is a 60-minute communal period, designed not just for eating but for student organizations to meet and foster the community aspects we discussed previously. The afternoon features two key components: another block class and a mandatory 'Academic Workshop Hour' (AWH).\n\nThe AWH is highly flexible and student-directed, serving as a dedicated time for study groups, independent research, or immediate access to teacher office hours for personalized support. This structure is designed specifically to build academic resilience and ensure students can manage the rigor effectively within the school day. We strive to make the daily flow supportive, efficient, and deeply engaging.",
