This phase immediately fosters strategic thinking and collaborative leadership.\n\n2. **Execution and Mentorship:** During implementation, students cycle through defined leadership roles (e.g., Project Manager, Communication Lead, Treasurer). They receive direct mentorship from faculty advisors who guide the process but intentionally step back from decision-making, ensuring students bear real responsibility for outcomes. This hands-on accountability is crucial for personal development.\n\n3. **Reflection and Synthesis:** Crucially, every project concludes with a mandatory reflection seminar where students analyze successes, failures, and their personal growth trajectory. This metacognitive process ensures that the practical experience translates into internalized leadership skills and a clear understanding of their strengths and areas for development. \n\nThis structured approach guarantees that you don't just participate; you lead, reflect, and grow into a capable, responsible leader.",
