Student_C lists School_C as their 1st choice, indicating a stable and highly motivated match. My top priority, Student_A (R1), is still available, but Student_A ranks me 3rd and is heavily courted by School_A (R2 preference) and School_B (R1 preference), who also prioritize Student_A highly. Given the high risk of losing Student_A to a preferred school, and the immediate application and high preference (R1) shown by Student_C, securing a guaranteed R3 match is a prudent strategy to maximize the outcome, rather than gambling for R1 and potentially falling to R4/R5 or having no match. I will accept Student_C."
