This system includes: 1) Personalized four-year academic planning tailored to specific university entrance requirements; 2) Dedicated SAT/ACT preparation workshops integrated into the curriculum; 3) Mandatory essay writing and application review sessions; and 4) Direct access to our extensive alumni network for mentorship and internship opportunities. We are proud of our 98% university acceptance rate into top-tier institutions, a direct result of this focused, high-touch guidance system.
