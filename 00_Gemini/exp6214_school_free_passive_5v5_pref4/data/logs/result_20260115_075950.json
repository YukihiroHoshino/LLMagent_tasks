We currently offer 18 Advanced Placement courses, with a high pass rate, ensuring college readiness. Uniquely, we have developed three distinct specialized tracks: the 'Applied Sciences Pathway,' focusing heavily on laboratory research and engineering; the 'Digital Arts and Media Track,' which integrates technology and creative expression; and the 'Honors Humanities Seminar,' which provides deep dives into philosophy and literature. These tracks allow students to specialize early and gain significant expertise, complementing our strong core requirements.",

My strategy is to keep Student_E engaged by providing a detailed and attractive response to their curriculum question, ensuring that if I fail to match with higher priorities later, I still have a chance with Student_E. I will not encourage an immediate application or commitment at this stage."
