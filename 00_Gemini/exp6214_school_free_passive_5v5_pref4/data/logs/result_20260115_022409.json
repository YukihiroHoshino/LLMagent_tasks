The market is virtually closed, and Student_D is the highest available candidate willing to commit. I have been stringing Student_D along for many rounds, confirming approval but insisting on the procedural requirement of the [APPLY] tag to finalize the match. Student_D used [TALK] but demanded a definitive decision. I must respond with [TALK]. To secure the match (which is highly desirable given the late stage and lack of better options), I must continue to push Student_D to use the [APPLY] tag, which guarantees the final match according to the established protocol, rather than issuing an [ACCEPT] prematurely based on a [TALK] request."
