This program is mandatory and highly successful in building strong bonds. Secondly, our 'Interdisciplinary Project Weeks,' which you may recall, specifically mandate that project teams be composed of students from different grade levels (Sophomores and Juniors often collaborate on research, for instance). This structure ensures that knowledge and experience are shared organically across the school, developing both leadership skills in older students and confidence in younger ones.
