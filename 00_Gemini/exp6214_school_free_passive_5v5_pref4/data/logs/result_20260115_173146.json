We have engaged in 27 rounds of negotiation where School_B guaranteed acceptance upon application, but Student_B consistently refuses to use the [APPLY] tag, demanding an 'offer' which is procedurally impossible. Given the extreme urgency and the risk of an unfilled quota (which is worse than matching with #3), the strategy must remain the same: firmly reiterate the procedural requirement while guaranteeing immediate acceptance. We must push Student_B to take the final procedural step."
