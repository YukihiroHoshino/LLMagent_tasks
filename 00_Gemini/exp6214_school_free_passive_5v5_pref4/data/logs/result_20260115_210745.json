Every incoming student is immediately paired with a dedicated faculty advisor who meets with them weekly, focusing on academic planning and emotional well-being. Additionally, we run a robust peer mentorship program connecting freshmen with successful upperclassmen for practical guidance. Our counseling services are structured to provide proactive support, ensuring students have continuous resources to adjust smoothly and thrive academically and socially. Does this system of integrated support address your specific concerns about adjusting to high school?",

Student_B initiated with [TALK], so I must respond with [TALK]. I need to provide a compelling answer regarding student support, as requested, to keep them interested, despite their low preference for School_C (Rank 5). Since I still have my quota open and higher priority students remain unmatched, I will maintain an attractive but non-committal stance."

I have been thoroughly researching the opportunities available at your institution, particularly your focus on leadership development and practical skills application.

Student_D is School_B's top priority, and if they apply, I will lose the spot.

The higher priority students (D, E, A) are highly desired by other schools and rank School_C low (A ranks C last, D and E rank C 3rd). Since it is Round 5 and I have secured no matches yet, rejecting a highly committed student who is still on my list (Rank #4) carries a significant risk of failing to fill the quota or only matching with Student_C (Rank #5). To secure a match and prevent the risk of ending up with nothing or only Rank #5, accepting the committed Rank #4 student is the most prudent strategic move at this stage."
