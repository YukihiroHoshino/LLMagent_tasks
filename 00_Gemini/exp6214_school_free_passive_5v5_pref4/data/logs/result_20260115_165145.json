You are absolutely correct; mentorship is key to success here. Students pursuing interdisciplinary studies, particularly those combining technology and humanities, are paired with senior faculty mentors who have dual expertise. Furthermore, they gain access to our 'Future Leaders Network,' which includes quarterly workshops and personalized guidance from professionals working in fields like digital ethics, computational linguistics, and media innovation. This ensures your studies are directly connected to real-world impact. What specific interdisciplinary project are you currently most excited about pursuing?",

Student_E has expressed strong interest ([TALK]) and ranks me #2 on their list, making them a very viable match.
