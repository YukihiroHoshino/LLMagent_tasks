Seeker_D is asking detailed structural questions, indicating they are in the final stages of decision-making. Although Company_E is Seeker_D's lowest preference, I must continue to be highly appealing and responsive to convert them into an applicant, as they are my best remaining option. I will provide a detailed answer regarding team structure and collaboration."
