While they are a secure match and highly committed, my top two priorities, Student_E (Rank 1) and Student_C (Rank 2), are still unmatched and available. Since Student_A only sent a [TALK] message, I must not accept them. I need to acknowledge their strong interest to keep them engaged as a viable fallback option, while continuing to hold out for higher-ranked students. I will maintain a positive but non-committal stance."

While Student_A (Rank 1) is still available, Student_A ranks School_E 4th overall, making securing them highly uncertain.
