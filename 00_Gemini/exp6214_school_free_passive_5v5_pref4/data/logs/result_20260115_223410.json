School_E ranks me last (5th). My best outcome (Rank 3) occurs if Student E matches with School A. Since I cannot communicate with Student E, I must focus on getting a definitive answer from School_E now, or signaling that I am about to move to my Rank 4 option (School A), which is highly likely to accept me (A ranks C #2). I will use a strong [TALK] message to pressure School_E to finalize their decision regarding my previous application, maintaining my interest in Rank 3 while preparing to pivot to Rank 4."

Crucially, School_A ranks me (Student_C) as their second most preferred student (P2), right after Student_E. Given that School_A is available and I am highly ranked by them, securing this match prevents me from potentially ending up with nothing if School_E ultimately rejects me.\n\nSince the priority ranking is very favorable (P2) and School_A is reasonably high on my list (P4/P2 available), applying directly is the best strategy to maximize my chances of securing a match better than my last choice, School_B (which is already matched)."
