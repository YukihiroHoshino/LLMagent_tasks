Company_D is my lowest preference but still acceptable. Company_A and Company_B, which are higher on my list, are still available. Company_D ranks me as their P2, meaning an application would likely be accepted, but this would prevent me from matching with A or B later. Since it is only Round 3 and better options exist, I should not commit to my lowest preference yet. I will use [TALK] to maintain interest without applying, keeping Company_D as a backup option."
