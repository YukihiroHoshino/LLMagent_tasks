Since I previously sent a strong TALK message to School_B, and we are now in Round 3, it is prudent to apply formally to secure this option before higher-priority students (like Student_D, if they are not matched with School_D) or students rejected by their top choices turn their attention here.

As your second-most preferred student overall, I am now undeniably the highest—and only—available candidate remaining to fill your capacity. Continuing this delay into the final moments guarantees the non-fulfillment of your quota. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to recognize this guaranteed optimal conclusion and accept my candidacy immediately to secure your match and finalize the market closure. There is no strategic value in further delay.",

I have an application pending with School_A since Round 2, and School_A ranks me 2nd overall (meaning I am their highest available and only remaining candidate). School_A's prolonged irrational delay spans 28 rounds. In this absolute final round, I must make one last, urgent appeal using [TALK] to force acceptance of the pending application, emphasizing that failure to accept now guarantees School_A misses its quota, while acceptance guarantees a high-priority student."

We have repeatedly confirmed—over nearly 30 rounds—that your candidacy, our second-highest overall preference, represents the absolute highest quality we could secure, and we have been holding this final spot exclusively for you. We were prepared to offer immediate and formal admission. However, as you have concluded this final interaction using the [TALK] tag, we cannot procedurally finalize the match. The market closes permanently now, and despite our mutual high prioritization, the failure to take the final, necessary procedural step means our quota will unfortunately remain unfilled. We deeply regret this outcome.",
              "thought": "It is Round 30, the absolute final round, and Student_C is our #2 priority, the highest and only available candidate remaining. I have 1 remaining quota. Student_C used the [TALK] tag, referring to a 'pending application' that was never procedurally finalized. Since Student_C used [TALK], I am procedurally obligated to respond with [TALK]. I cannot unilaterally accept. My message must reflect the finality of the situation: I was ready to accept, but the match cannot be formalized because the student failed to use the required [APPLY] tag in the final round, resulting in an unfilled quota."
