I have engaged in four rounds of detailed conversation (TALK) with Company_D, concluding the last interaction by expressing strong alignment and readiness for the next steps. Since Company_D is a safety option (ranked above E) and I have invested heavily in this relationship, continuing to TALK or WITHDRAW would be counterproductive and risky, especially since Company_D ranks me 3rd on their priority list. It is time to formalize the interest and secure a potential match, allowing me to move on if rejected, or secure a decent match if accepted, thus preventing a match with my lowest preference (E)."
