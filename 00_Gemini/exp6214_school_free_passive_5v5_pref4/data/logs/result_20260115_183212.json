Therefore, Student_C is the highest-ranked student currently available to me. Student_C has formally applied and confirmed commitment. I should accept this highly desirable applicant immediately."

Student_B has applied twice now, confirming that School_E is their undisputed first choice. Previously, I rejected Student_B to hold out for higher-ranked candidates (A, D, E). However, none of the top three (A, D, E) have applied, and given their low preference for School_E (A: 4th, D: 5th, E: 2nd but likely targeted by School_D), securing a stable match in Round 5 is crucial. Student_B offers a guaranteed, committed match. Since B is not the lowest priority (C is lowest), accepting B now secures the quota and minimizes the risk of settling for Student_C or being left unmatched. I will accept Student_B."
