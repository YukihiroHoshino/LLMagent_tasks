I have applied twice previously without securing a match, likely due to my low priority ranking (4th/5) at School_E, which is holding out for Student_A, D, or E. Since I have not yet secured a match and School_E remains available, I must continue to actively pursue this option. I will apply for the third time, strongly reiterating my commitment and hoping that the higher-priority students are either matched elsewhere or have rejected School_E."

We recognize the strength of your profile and the sincerity of your desire to join our institution, reflected by your placing us as your first choice. After careful consideration of the remaining applicants and our institutional needs, we are pleased to inform you that we are now prepared to finalize a match. We happily accept your application and look forward to welcoming you.",

The current list of unmatched Studets explicitly includes only Student_B and Student_C. This strongly suggests that School_E's top three priorities (A, D, E) have already been matched elsewhere. Therefore, Student_B is the highest-ranked available candidate remaining. Student_B has applied three times and ranks School_E as their absolute first choice. Given the remaining quota of 1, securing a match with the highest remaining priority candidate who is also highly dedicated is the optimal strategy to fulfill the objective."
