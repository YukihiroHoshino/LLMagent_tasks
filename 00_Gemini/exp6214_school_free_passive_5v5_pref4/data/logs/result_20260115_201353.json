Despite four previous applications, I was rejected, likely because School_D (D) prioritizes students S_B, S_D, S_E, and S_C over me (S_A is D's lowest priority). However, D is still unmatched in Round 7, strongly suggesting that D's top three priorities (S_B, S_D, S_E) have matched with School_A, School_B, or School_E, which are now closed. The remaining competitor for D is likely S_C, who D ranks just above me. Since D is still available, it must be holding out or waiting for S_C to apply. I cannot afford to wait or merely talk, as S_C might secure the spot. I must apply aggressively for the fifth time, emphasizing my unwavering commitment, hoping D values certainty and dedication over a slight priority difference, especially since the market is rapidly closing. If rejected, I will consider School_C."
