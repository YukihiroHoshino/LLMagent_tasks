I believe my academic profile and dedication align perfectly with your standards. Given my strong interest, I wish to formally submit my application now and guarantee immediate acceptance if offered a spot.",
              "thought": "I am Student_C. My preference list is ['School_D', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B']. School_A is ranked 4th. The only unmatched schools remaining are School_A (Rank 4) and School_E (Rank 3). I have applied to School_E four times without success, likely because School_E ranks me P5. School_A, however, ranks me P2. Since School_A is available and views me very favorably, securing this match (Rank 4) is a high probability outcome and a strong safety net, especially since my top three choices have not accepted me. I should apply immediately to School_A."

We greatly appreciate your dedication and strong interest. After careful consideration of your outstanding academic profile and your expressed commitment to our institution, we are delighted to inform you that we are extending an offer of admission. We look forward to welcoming you to the School_A community.",

Although Student_E (Rank 1) is still available, Student_E ranks School_A as their last choice (5th), making a successful match risky. Student_C, while ranking School_A 4th, has applied and offered immediate commitment. Given that the round count is 9 and I have a critical need to fill my single quota with a high-priority student, securing Rank 2 is a strong strategic move that minimizes risk. I will accept Student_C."
