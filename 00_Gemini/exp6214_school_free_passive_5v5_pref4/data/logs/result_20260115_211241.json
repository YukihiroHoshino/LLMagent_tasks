Student_B is ranked 5th out of 5 on my priority list (['Student_E', 'Student_C', 'Student_D', 'Student_A', 'Student_B']). Since it is still early (Round 3) and my top priority students (E, C, D) are still unmatched, accepting Student_B would be a significant missed opportunity. Student_B's high preference for School_A (Rank 2) is noted, but this does not override my internal priority ranking.

We utilize seminar-style classes and project-based assessments starting in the first year to continuously challenge students' analytical abilities.

Second, we provide curated access to university-level online courses and resources, granting credit for advanced work in fields like advanced mathematics or theoretical physics, fully supported by our academic counseling staff.
