While I am highly competitive for my top choices (D and C), my low priority ranking across the board means I need to start securing matches if possible, even if they are lower on my list. I had a prior [TALK] session with School_E where I expressed high dedication. Since School_E is a desirable option (3rd choice), it is time to formalize my interest and apply, moving beyond just talking. A rejection will confirm I must pursue D or C more aggressively, but an acceptance secures a good outcome. I will use the [APPLY] tag."

Your program aligns perfectly with my long-term goals. Given my strong performance history and dedication, I formally submit my application now, eager to become a contributing member of your community.",

Schools D and C are likely matched or unavailable since they are not in the unmatched list. School_E (my 3rd choice) is unmatched, and I have already submitted an application there, but no match has been confirmed. School_A is still unmatched. Crucially, School_A ranks me (Student_C) as their 2nd most preferred student, giving me a high chance of acceptance. Given that the market is progressing (Round 4) and I haven't secured a match higher than 4th choice, securing School_A where I am highly prioritized is a strategic move to ensure I match with a school on my list, especially since my application to School_E is still pending/unconfirmed. I will apply immediately to leverage my high priority ranking at School_A."
