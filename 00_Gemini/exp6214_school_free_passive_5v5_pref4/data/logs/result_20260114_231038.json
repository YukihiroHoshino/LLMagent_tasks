Although Student_E has repeatedly shown extreme commitment (School_E is their 1st choice), School_E still has its full quota (1) remaining and must prioritize matching with higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) who are presumably still available in the market. Since Student_E used the [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]. The strategy remains to keep Student_E engaged and hopeful as a backup option, without committing, to allow more time for higher-priority students to apply or be matched."

I must continue to apply pressure and signal my immediate readiness to accept, hoping that the higher-priority students have matched elsewhere or withdrawn. Sending another formal [APPLY] is redundant.
