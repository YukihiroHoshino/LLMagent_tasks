Second, we implement a 'Vertical Mentorship Program,' pairing every new student with a junior or senior student leader who provides guidance and support throughout the first semester. Crucially, academically, we utilize small, collaborative learning cohorts in foundational subjects, ensuring immediate, personalized faculty attention and fostering strong internal peer support networks.
