School_D is highly favorable towards me, ranking me #1 in their priority list. Since School_D is guaranteed, it serves as an excellent safety net. However, I still have two higher preference schools available: School_E (#1, already applied, status unknown) and School_A (#2, not yet applied). Committing to School_D now (4th choice) would prevent me from pursuing School_A (2nd choice). Given that it is only Round 3, the optimal strategy is to maintain strong interest with School_D (my guaranteed backup) using [TALK], while keeping my options open for higher-ranked schools (especially School_A) in subsequent rounds."

This mentor provides guidance on relevant extracurriculars, specific college entrance requirements, and interview preparation tailored to top-tier programs in that field. We have a 95% success rate in placing students into their top two college major choices.
