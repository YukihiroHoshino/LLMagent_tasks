Student_A is the last remaining student and has confirmed School_E is their last option, threatening to remain unmatched if an acceptance isn't immediately extended. The core issue is a communication breakdown, as School_E explicitly accepted Student_A's binding application in Round 13, but the match hasn't been finalized in the system, and Student_A continues to request an 'acceptance.' Since Student_A used [TALK], I must use [TALK]. I must deliver a final, unequivocal message that clarifies the R13 acceptance and places the responsibility for finalization back onto Student_A to secure the match, preventing them from withdrawing entirely."

However, School_E has consistently refused to accept me, despite me being their highest priority candidate (P1) and having submitted multiple applications and urgent appeals. In Round 18, I issued an ultimate ultimatum: accept now, or I will choose to remain unmatched. Since School_E failed to accept in Round 18, I must follow through on my stated commitment to maintain strategic consistency and credibility. Continuing to appeal to School_E after this point contradicts my final stated position.

Although Student_A formally and permanently withdrew in Round 19, the goal of maximizing the preference rank dictates securing this spot now that the market is fully closed.
