Student_A is clearly close to making a decision, as they are 'finalizing application decisions.' Since they used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. My message should directly address their query about requirements, making the formal application process seem simple, yet framing it as the critical step to secure a spot, thus encouraging them to move from [TALK] to [APPLY] when they are ready, without me having to commit to an [ACCEPT] prematurely."

I should not commit to my lowest choice (School_C) unless absolutely necessary, as accepting C would prevent me from matching with D, A, B, or E later if they become available. Although I have a favorable rank (3rd) at School_C, I will maintain interest through [TALK] rather than applying, preserving my strategic flexibility to pursue higher preferences. My last message to School_C already implied readiness to apply, so the current message should be a logistical follow-up to keep the conversation going without commitment."

For students who have reached this stage following detailed conversations, the acceptance decision can be issued almost instantaneously upon receiving your formal [APPLY] tag.

Student_A is currently stalling by asking about timelines, indicating they are still weighing their options (School_C is their last choice). My strategy is to answer the question honestly (rolling admissions/immediate review) but use this opportunity to heavily pressure Student_A to formalize their commitment with the [APPLY] tag immediately, emphasizing the scarcity of the remaining quota. Since the student used [TALK], I must reply with [TALK]."

This is a desirable match, though not the top priority. Since S_A has formally applied ([APPLY]), I must decide between ACCEPT and REJECT. While Student_D (Rank 1) and Student_E (Rank 2) are higher priorities, they are also highly sought after by schools they prefer over School_C (S_D prefers D, B; S_E prefers D, A, E). Rejecting S_A carries a high risk of being left without a match, as D and E are likely to be matched elsewhere soon. Securing a high-ranking match (Rank 3) now is prudent, especially since S_A is applying, suggesting they are serious about securing a spot. I will ACCEPT Student_A to secure a strong placement and fill the quota."
