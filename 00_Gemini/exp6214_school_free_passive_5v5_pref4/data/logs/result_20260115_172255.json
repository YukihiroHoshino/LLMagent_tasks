School_E is my 3rd choice, which is desirable. In Round 9, School_E is the only remaining unmatched school. This means all other students (A, B, D, E) are matched, and I am the only student left. School_E has rejected my applications three times, likely hoping for a higher priority student (A, D, E, B) who is currently matched but might become available, or simply because I am their lowest priority. However, in this late stage, School_E must realize that I am likely their only available match. I must apply again, using the strongest language possible to convey absolute commitment, thereby forcing School_E's hand, as remaining unmatched is worse than matching with their lowest acceptable student (C). I will reaffirm my commitment and apply."
