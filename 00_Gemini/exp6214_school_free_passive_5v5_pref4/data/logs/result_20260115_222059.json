Since it is Round 1 and no matches have occurred, securing a relatively high preference now is valuable, especially since my top two preferences (School_E and School_A) rank me very low (4th and 5th, respectively). Applying to School_B gives me a decent chance of acceptance (3rd priority for 1 spot) and secures my 3rd choice, preventing higher-priority students (D and A) from taking the spot later if they haven't applied elsewhere.
