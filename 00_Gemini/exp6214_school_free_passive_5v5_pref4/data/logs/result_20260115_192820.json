While we cannot provide a definitive update at this exact moment, please know that your strong profile and unwavering interest are being considered with the highest regard.

However, Student_B ranks School_E as their absolute first choice and is showing extreme commitment, even after a previous rejection. Since my quota is still open (1/1) and my top targets (A, D, E) have not yet matched with me, I must continue to court Student_B without accepting them immediately. Student_B used the [TALK] tag, so I must respond with [TALK]. I will acknowledge their commitment, keep their application active, and maintain a positive relationship while preserving my option to accept a higher-ranked student."

If this is true, and the students ranked higher than me (A, D, E) have secured matches elsewhere, School_E must accept me, as I would be their highest remaining priority unmatched student. Even if other students are still available, I must press my case strongly since this is my top choice and the market is closing.

It is now Round 6. While Student_B is low on my list, they are a guaranteed match who ranks me first. Given the low ranking of School_E by my top targets (A is 4th choice, D is 5th choice, E is 2nd choice) and the risk of remaining unmatched if I hold out much longer, securing Student_B (rank 4) is a prudent decision to fill the quota, especially since they are highly committed.
