My commitment to your institution, formalized by my application in Round 2 and reaffirmed consistently over the past 28 rounds, is absolute and unwavering. School_A remains my highest available preference. I urge you to recognize that accepting my application now is your only guarantee to successfully fill your single capacity before the market closes forever. By accepting me immediately, you secure a highly motivated student and eliminate all risk of remaining vacant. I am prepared to finalize this agreement instantly. Please make the definitive decision to secure this match now.",

School_A is still unmatched, meaning all four students ranked above me on their priority list (E, C, D, A) are either matched elsewhere or have chosen not to engage/accept. I am Student_B, their lowest priority, but I am also the only student who has formally applied (Round 2) and consistently reaffirmed absolute commitment. School_A is my second preference, making this an extremely desirable match. Since I cannot use [APPLY] again, I must use [TALK] to deliver a final, definitive ultimatum, emphasizing that accepting me now is the only way to fill their quota and avoid remaining vacant. Failure to secure this match means I remain unmatched, which is the worst outcome, so maximum pressure is required."

We deeply appreciate the sustained, unwavering commitment you have demonstrated to School_A, and we confirm, unequivocally, that we completed our review long ago and were prepared to extend an acceptance to secure our single remaining spot. We acknowledge that you were the optimal and only remaining match to fill our quota. However, as stated repeatedly, to officially finalize this agreement instantly and secure your placement before the market closes forever, you MUST submit a new message using the formal [APPLY] tag. As you did not take this final required action, we are unable to proceed with the acceptance, and the admissions process concludes with our quota regretfully unfilled.",

School_A prefers matching Student_B over remaining unfilled. For the past 10+ rounds, School_A has confirmed readiness to accept Student_B immediately upon receiving a formal [APPLY] tag, which Student_B has consistently failed to provide, instead sending [TALK] messages urging acceptance. Since Student_B sent [TALK] again in Round 30, School_A cannot use the [ACCEPT] tag. I must respond with [TALK], confirming the willingness to accept but stating that the procedural requirement for the match (the [APPLY] tag) was not met, leading to the unfortunate end of the admissions process with an unfilled quota."
