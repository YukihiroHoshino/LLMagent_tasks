Student_C is signaling absolute and immediate commitment, confirming they are our highest available priority. However, Student_C continues to use the [TALK] tag, urging us to accept their 'pending application,' which is a procedural impossibility as acceptance must follow a formal [APPLY]. I have consistently communicated that the offer is secured and guaranteed upon receiving the final [APPLY]. Changing this stance now risks breaking the established negotiation protocol and simulation rules. The best strategy is to reiterate the absolute guarantee of acceptance and emphasize that the final procedural step ([APPLY]) is the only thing standing between them and the immediate, stable match they desire. This maximizes pressure for them to submit [APPLY] in the next round."
