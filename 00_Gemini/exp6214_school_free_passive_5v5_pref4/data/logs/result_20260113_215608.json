I previously sent an [APPLY] message, but since Company_A is still unmatched, the application either resulted in a rejection or is pending/reset. Company_A ranks me (Seeker_B) as their 2nd preference, which is a strong position. I must maintain aggressive pursuit of this top choice. I will re-apply/reaffirm my application to demonstrate continued commitment and urgency, hoping to secure the match before Seeker_A (Company_A's top choice) takes action."

Seeker_B has applied aggressively, confirming Company_A is their absolute top choice, and they are ready to accept immediately. I previously rejected Seeker_B, likely hoping to secure Seeker_A. However, waiting longer risks losing Seeker_B entirely, who is a fantastic match (#2 on my list, #1 on their list). While Seeker_A is still available, securing a guaranteed high-priority match (Seeker_B) in Round 3 is strategically sound, especially since Seeker_A prefers Company_B first. I will accept Seeker_B to fulfill my quota with a dedicated, high-ranking candidate."
