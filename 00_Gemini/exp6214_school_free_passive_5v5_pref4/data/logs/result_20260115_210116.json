Crucially, Student_B ranks School_E as their absolute #1 choice.

Applying now risks locking myself into my lowest choice if School_C accepts (I am 3rd on their priority list). Since it is still early (Round 4), I must avoid committing. I have used [TALK] three times already.

This keeps my options open for higher-ranked schools."

School C takes great pride in our robust transition support system. Our process begins with a comprehensive, multi-day orientation program in August, designed not just for logistics but for community building and skill development. Crucially, every incoming student is immediately assigned a dedicated Faculty Advisor who serves as their primary guide throughout their four years here. Furthermore, we implement a highly successful Peer Mentor Program, pairing new students with successful upperclassmen who provide personalized social and academic advice, ensuring nobody feels lost or unsupported during their critical first year. We are fully invested in making sure every student feels integrated and ready to thrive from day one. Do these programs address your specific concerns, or are there other elements of school life you wish to explore?",

Student_A continues to engage with detailed questions ([TALK]), indicating serious consideration, despite School_C being their last preference. I need to maintain the active appeal strategy by providing comprehensive and reassuring answers to their question about transition support. The goal is to solidify School_C as their most appealing option among their backups, encouraging an [APPLY] action in future rounds, while respecting the current [TALK] tag."

I have already engaged in four rounds of detailed conversation (TALK), gathering sufficient information. School_C ranks me 3rd ('Student_A' is third after 'Student_D' and 'Student_E'). If Student_D and Student_E are matched elsewhere (which is implied if C is the last remaining school), my application has a high probability of acceptance. I must apply now to secure a match."
