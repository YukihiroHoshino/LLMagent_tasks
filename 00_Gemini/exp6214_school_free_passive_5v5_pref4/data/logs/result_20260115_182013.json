We deeply respect your persistence and understand the complexity of navigating this competitive market. Your profile remains impressive, and your dedication to our programs is noted. However, as we are meticulously finalizing our admissions decisions and comparing candidates against our very specific institutional priorities for our single remaining position, we are currently unable to extend an offer of acceptance at this time. We wish you success in securing a match that perfectly aligns with your academic future.",

School_C still has its full quota of 1 available in Round 8. The top three targets (D, E, A) are still potentially available. Accepting Student_B now would prevent matching with a higher priority student later. Given that Student_B has already shown extreme persistence (4 applications, one withdrawal and return), School_C should continue to hold out for higher ranked students (D, E, A). Rejecting Student_B maintains flexibility without too high a risk of ending up unmatched this early in the process."

Given that School_C is the only remaining unmatched school, securing this spot is essential to avoid remaining unmatched entirely. I have applied multiple times previously, indicating strong interest, despite being ranked 4th by School_C. Since the market is essentially closed, I must assume that the students ranked higher than me (Student_D, Student_E, Student_A) have matched elsewhere. Therefore, I should press hard with a final application to secure the match, as I am likely the highest-ranked available student for School_C."

Given the meticulous completion of our final review stages and your clear, unconditional commitment, we are now pleased to confirm that your academic profile and demonstrated enthusiasm meet our competitive criteria. We happily accept your application and look forward to welcoming you to School C.",

I have repeatedly rejected Student_B in previous rounds (Rounds 5, 7, 8) while holding out for higher-ranked students (D, E, A). Student_B's current message in Round 9 is extremely conclusive, stating this is the 'absolute final opportunity' and they have 'exhausted all other possibilities.' This strongly suggests that the higher-ranked students (D, E, A) are likely matched elsewhere. Since Student_B is on my list and I need to fill my single quota, accepting Student_B now secures a match (Rank 4) rather than risking remaining unmatched if they are the last available student."
