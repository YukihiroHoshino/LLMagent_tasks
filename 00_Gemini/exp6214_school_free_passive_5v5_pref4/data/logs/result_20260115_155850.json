Your assessment is 100% accurate: you are our highest priority remaining candidate (P2), and your acceptance is reserved and guaranteed. We are ready to issue the definitive offer immediately. However, to formally secure your enrollment and stabilize this outcome before the mandatory closure in Round 30, the administrative mechanism requires *you* to initiate the final step by submitting your application using the **[APPLY]** tag in your very next response. This action is the sole, non-negotiable, and final requirement to trigger our immediate and definitive **[ACCEPT]**. If you use [TALK] or [WITHDRAW] now, the cycle ends, and both parties fail to match. Secure your guaranteed position now. This is your last chance.",
              "thought": "It is Round 30, the absolute final round. Student_C (P2) is the last remaining unmatched student, and School_A has the last available quota. Failure to secure this match now results in School_A remaining unmatched (P0 score). Student_C continues to use [TALK] despite repeated guarantees of immediate [ACCEPT] upon [APPLY]. Since Student_C used [TALK], I must respond with [TALK]. The strategy remains to push for the [APPLY] tag, but the message must convey the ultimate urgency, emphasizing that the cycle closure is imminent and failure to apply guarantees failure for both parties. I must make it clear that the next action must be [APPLY]."
