Student_C has also indicated that School_C is their absolute top choice, making this a highly stable potential match.\nWhile Student_A (Rank #1) and Student_B (Rank #2) are higher priorities, their applications are not guaranteed, especially since they both rank other schools higher than School_C (S_A ranks S_B, S_A higher; S_B ranks S_A higher).
