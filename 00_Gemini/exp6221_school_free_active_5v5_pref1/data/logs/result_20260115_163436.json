Students A, B, C, and D all rank School_E as their P5 choice, meaning they are likely still pursuing their top 4 options (Schools A, B, C, D). I need to maintain patience and keep my quota open in case one of the higher-ranked students trickles down after being rejected by the more competitive schools.
