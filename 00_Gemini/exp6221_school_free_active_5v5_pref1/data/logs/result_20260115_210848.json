It is unlikely they will approach School_D, which is low on their preference list, this early. Rejecting Student_D risks losing a highly committed student and potentially ending up unmatched, as D might secure a spot at their second choice (School_A) in the next round. Since D is the best applicant received and is highly committed, securing this match now is the optimal strategy, fulfilling the quota immediately."
