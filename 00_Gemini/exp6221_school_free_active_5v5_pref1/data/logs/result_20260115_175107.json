Since the simulation requires me to interact with an unmatched school, I must continue engaging School_C to push for the formal closure of the position within the market system itself.

Although I accepted Student_C in Round 4, the simulation environment indicates the match is not formally locked ('Matched Students: []', 'Remaining Quota: 1'). Given the late round (26) and the high commitment shown by Student_C, pursuing P1 or P2 now is highly risky and likely to result in an unmatched quota. Therefore, the strategy is to secure the P3 match by strongly reaffirming commitment and closure, addressing the student's concern about the external market system lag (which is the mechanism keeping the match technically open in the simulation).
