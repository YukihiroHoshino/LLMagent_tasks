Given that my top three priorities (A, B, C) rank School_D very low (P4 or P5), it is highly probable they are applying to their preferred schools (A, B, C) in Round 1. Waiting for A, B, or C carries a high risk of being left unmatched, as they are unlikely to reach out to School_D unless rejected multiple times. Securing a guaranteed match with a student who is highly motivated (P1 for them) in Round 1, even if they are P4 for me, is a prudent strategy given the competitive environment and my low preference rating among top students.

It is strategically sound to hold my single quota open in Round 1 to see if Student_A or Student_B applies in subsequent rounds, especially if they are rejected by their top preferences (School_B for A, School_A for B).

School_C rejected me in R1 likely hoping for a higher priority candidate, but that hope is now diminished.

Since A and B prioritize School_B and School_A respectively, it is highly likely they have matched there, or are pursuing those options aggressively. Student_C's message suggests they believe higher priority students are matched, making them the best available candidate.
