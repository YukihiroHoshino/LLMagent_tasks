If School_E's top priority students are gone, I, Student_E (the lowest priority candidate), become the necessary match to fill their quota.

Student_E is my lowest priority candidate (Rank 5/5), but they are highly committed (5th application, School_E is their #1 choice). Higher priority students (A, B, C, D) have not applied to School_E, which is expected as School_E is a low preference for them. Given the late stage of the process (Round 5), the probability of securing a higher-ranked student is diminishing rapidly, and the risk of remaining unmatched (0 quota filled) increases significantly if I continue rejecting the only persistent applicant. Student_E's argument about the market thinning out is strategically sound. Accepting Student_E secures a guaranteed match, fulfilling my quota, rather than gambling on the unlikely arrival of a higher-ranked student who probably secured a match with their preferred schools (A, B, C, D). Therefore, I will accept Student_E."
