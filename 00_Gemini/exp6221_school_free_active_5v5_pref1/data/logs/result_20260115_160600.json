Student_C (P3) has submitted an application ([APPLY]). Although Student_A (P1) and Student_B (P2) are higher priority, they are highly contested and likely applied to their own P1/P2 schools (School_B/School_A). Student_C lists School_C as their P1 preference, making this a stable and secure match.

Although I am the lowest priority student for School_E, since they receive no applications from students ranked higher than me, they should accept my application immediately in this negotiation format, provided they prefer matching over remaining unmatched, which is usually the case when capacity exists.

My top three priorities (S_A, S_B, S_C) rank me very low (4th or 5th) and are likely applying to their preferred schools (School_A, B, C) in Round 1. The chance of S_A, S_B, or S_C approaching me is low. If I reject S_D, I risk being left unmatched, as my higher priorities are unlikely to contact me. Accepting S_D secures a stable match, preventing me from being shut out of the market.
