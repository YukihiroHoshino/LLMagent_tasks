We absolutely offer structured mentorship opportunities, including both faculty advisors and a highly successful Peer Mentor Program that pairs incoming students with experienced upperclassmen. These programs are designed specifically to ensure a smooth academic and social transition. Details regarding the application process for these mentorship programs, including introductory contact information and the timeline for pairing, will be comprehensively outlined in the detailed logistical packet scheduled for dispatch in late July. Your continued commitment to integrating fully into School_E is deeply valued. We look forward to sharing those specifics soon!",

Since Student_E sent a [TALK] message asking about mentorship programs, I must reply with [TALK]. I need to provide a helpful, encouraging answer that maintains the strong relationship and confirms these details will be provided in the upcoming logistical packet, reinforcing the timeline."
