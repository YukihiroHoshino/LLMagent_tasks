Given the advanced stage of the matching process, it is highly probable that the most sought-after students (A, B, C, D) have successfully matched with their preferred schools (B, A, C, D, respectively, or their second choices). If I reject Student_E now, I risk going unmatched entirely (utility 0), which is worse than accepting Student_E (utility based on Rank 5). Since my strategy to secure a top-tier student has not materialized after 5 rounds, and Student_E offers immediate commitment, accepting E is the necessary action to fulfill the quota before the market completely clears."
