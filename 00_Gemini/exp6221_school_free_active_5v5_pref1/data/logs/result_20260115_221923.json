Students A, B, C, and D all rank School_E as their 4th or 5th choice. Given that all other schools (A, B, C, D) also prioritize A, B, C, D highly, it is highly likely that A, B, C, and D have applied to and will be accepted by their top preferred schools in this round.\n\nIf I reject Student_E, I face a very high risk of remaining unmatched, as the students I prefer (A, B, C, D) are unlikely to become available or apply to me in later rounds, having secured better matches elsewhere.\n\nSince Student_E is a certain match, and rejecting them results in a near-certain failure to meet the quota, accepting Student_E is the optimal strategy to secure a match, even though they are my lowest priority."

My higher priorities (A, B, C) are likely applying to schools they prefer more (School_A, School_B, School_C) in this initial round.

Waiting longer risks Student_C matching elsewhere (e.g., School_B, where they are Rank 2 preference) and School_C potentially being left with only lower priority students (D or E) if A and B match elsewhere.
