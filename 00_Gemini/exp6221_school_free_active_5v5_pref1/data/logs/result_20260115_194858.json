Students A, B, and C all rank other schools (A, B, C) higher than School_D (School_D is P4/P5 for them). They are highly likely to apply to those preferred schools first.\n\nIf I reject Student_D, I risk ending up unmatched or matching with Student_E later.

Since School_E is still unmatched in Round 2, the higher-priority student must have matched with a different school (likely their own top preference).

Student_E is my lowest priority (P5). However, Student_E ranks School_E as their absolute top choice (P1) and has shown persistence by applying for the second time after being rejected in Round 1.\n\nSchool_E is the least preferred option for students A, B, C, and D, meaning they are unlikely to apply unless they are rejected by four other schools. Waiting for P1-P4 carries a significant risk of remaining unmatched, as Student_E might secure a spot at their P2 or P3 school (School_B or School_A) if rejected again.\n\nGiven the high commitment from Student_E and the low probability of securing a higher-ranked student quickly, accepting Student_E now secures a match and fulfills the quota, minimizing the risk of ending up unmatched. Although Student_E is P5, a guaranteed match is prudent for a school that is generally ranked low by the top candidates."
