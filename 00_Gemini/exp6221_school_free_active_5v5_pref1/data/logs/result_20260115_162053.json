              "thought": "I am School_E (Quota: 1, Matched: 0). Student_E is my lowest priority (5th), but they are my only applicant this round. The market is in Round 25, indicating that most higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) are likely matched elsewhere, or actively avoiding me. Historically, Student_E and I have had an agreement since Round 1, confirmed 24 times. Rejecting Student_E now would be highly illogical given the history and the late stage of the market, risking remaining unmatched entirely. Therefore, securing the quota with Student_E is the necessary and strategic move."
