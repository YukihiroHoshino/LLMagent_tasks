Since School_E has a capacity of 1 and receives only one application, it must accept me, even though I am the lowest priority student.

Given that the higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) all rank School_E very low (4th or 5th), it is highly probable that they applied to their preferred schools (A, B, C, D) and will only consider School_E later, if at all. Rejecting Student_E carries a high risk of being left unmatched entirely, as Student_E might secure a spot elsewhere (e.g., School_B, their second choice). Securing a guaranteed match in Round 1, even with my lowest priority student, is the safest strategy given my low market standing among top candidates."
