Student_E (P5) is the only applicant this round and has applied persistently (4th time). While Student_E is my lowest priority, they rank School_E as their absolute top choice, indicating strong commitment. Higher priority students (A, B, C, D) all rank School_E very low (4th or 5th). Given the advanced round number and the high likelihood that higher-ranked students are either matched elsewhere or still pursuing schools they prefer significantly over E, the probability of securing A, B, C, or D is diminishing rapidly. Rejecting Student_E again risks ending up unmatched, as Student_E might move to their second choice (School_B). Securing a match with a highly committed student (P5) is a prudent decision at this stage to utilize the quota."
