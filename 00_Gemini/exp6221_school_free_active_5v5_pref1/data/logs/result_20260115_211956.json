Although Student_D is not my top priority, the students ranked higher (A, B, C) rank School_D low (4th or 5th) and are likely pursuing their higher preferred schools (A, B, C) in Round 1. Rejecting Student_D carries a high risk of failing to secure any student better than Student_D, and potentially losing Student_D entirely to other schools if they are subsequently rejected by their top choices. Since Student_D is the highest-ranked student who actively applied to me in this round, accepting them maximizes my utility based on current information and secures a high-satisfaction match immediately."

Since A and B are the top priorities for those highly preferred schools, they are highly likely to be matched in Round 1. If A and B match elsewhere, Student_C is the highest-ranked student available and applying to School_C. Accepting Student_C secures a match at rank 3, which is the best outcome achievable if A and B are unavailable. Rejecting C risks losing C to their second choice (School_B) and potentially ending up with a lower-ranked student or no match at all. Therefore, I will accept Student_C."

In Round 1, I rejected them to hold out for higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D). Since only Student_E has applied again in Round 2, it indicates that A, B, C, and D are likely pursuing their higher preferences elsewhere (Schools A, B, C, D). While accepting Student_E would secure a match, it is too early (Round 2) to settle for my lowest priority student, especially since they have demonstrated persistence. I will reject them again, maintaining the possibility of attracting a higher-ranked student in Round 3, while relying on Student_E's high preference for School_E to potentially bring them back if they fail to match with their next choices (School_B, School_A)."

I have rejected Student_E twice, hoping that higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) might become available, perhaps having been rejected by their top choices (Schools A, B, C, D). However, Student_E's message strongly suggests that the market is saturated and closed, implying that Students A, B, C, and D have successfully matched with their preferred institutions (which ranked them highly). If this assessment is accurate, Student_E is the highest, and potentially only, available candidate remaining. Accepting Student_E fills my quota (1/1) and avoids the outcome of remaining unmatched, which is worse than matching with my 5th priority.
