Given that School_E is ranked very low (4th or 5th) by Student_A, B, C, and D, it is highly likely that A, B, C, and D applied to their higher preferred schools (A, B, C, D), and those schools, sharing the same priority list as me, are likely to accept them immediately based on the standard deferred acceptance mechanism logic (or similar preference-driven matching). If I reject Student_E, I risk being unmatched, as the higher-ranked students will be gone.
