School_C is unmatched and still available. Although I have been rejected twice by School_C, they are my Rank 1 preference, and given that they have a capacity of 1 and are prioritizing Student_A and Student_B above me, they likely rejected me because A or B were still active candidates. If A and B have matched elsewhere, I become School_C's highest available priority. Since School_C is still unmatched, I must make one final, strong attempt to secure this position before moving down to my lowest preference, School_E (Rank 5). I will use the [APPLY] tag."

Students A (P1) and B (P2) are higher priorities, but neither has applied to School_C yet, likely pursuing their top preferences (School_A and School_B). I have rejected Student_C three times already, attempting to signal that I am waiting for higher-ranked students. Student_C has demonstrated extreme commitment (School_C is their P1 preference and they are applying for the 4th time). The risk of losing Student_C to their P2 choice (School_B, where they are also a high priority) if I reject them again is significant. Since Student_C is a solid, highly committed P3, and securing a match is crucial, I will accept this offer now to guarantee the highest available priority match before they move on. This maximizes my outcome given the current information."
