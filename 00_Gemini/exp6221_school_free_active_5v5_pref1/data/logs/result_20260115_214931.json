In previous rounds, I rejected Student_C (#3 priority, who listed me as their #1 choice) twice to hold out for Student_A or Student_B. Accepting Student_E now would immediately fill my quota with the lowest ranked student, sacrificing the chance to secure A, B, C, or D. Student_E lists me as their 4th choice, though they claim I am their 'current top priority,' suggesting they were rejected by their top three choices (E, B, A). Given the high priority students are still available and potentially active, I must continue to hold out. I will reject Student_E."

This situation means I am now the highest available candidate (3rd priority overall) for School_C.\nSince School_C is my Rank 1 choice and there is only one other remaining option (School_E, Rank 5), I must make one final, definitive attempt to secure a match with School_C.

Student_C is my 3rd priority (P3) and has applied aggressively for the fourth consecutive round, indicating that School_C is their absolute first choice. My top two priorities, Student_A and Student_B, have not applied yet, likely negotiating with their higher preferred schools (School_A and School_B). It is Round 4, and delaying further risks losing Student_C (P3) to their second choice (School_B), potentially leaving me with only lower-ranked students or an unfilled quota. Since Student_C is a highly desirable match (P3) and guarantees immediate commitment, securing this match now is the optimal strategy to maximize my rank outcome while mitigating risk."

However, Student_E ranks School_E as their top choice and has reapplied enthusiastically following a prior rejection, indicating strong commitment. Crucially, School_E is ranked last (5th) by all higher-priority students (A, B, C, D). It is highly probable that students A, B, C, and D are already matched or pursuing their top 4 school choices. As it is Round 4 and School_E has a full quota remaining, waiting for a higher-ranked student who views School_E as a last resort is extremely risky and likely to result in School_E remaining unmatched. Therefore, securing the match with the only student who truly desires School_E is the pragmatic choice to ensure the quota is met."
