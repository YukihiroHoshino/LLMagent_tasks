However, Student_D has applied immediately in Round 1, listing School_D as their absolute top choice (1st preference). Given that School_D is a low preference (4th or 5th) for my top priorities (A, B, C), it is highly unlikely they will apply to me in early rounds, as they are targeting Schools A, B, or C. If I reject Student_D, I risk remaining unmatched if A, B, and C secure spots elsewhere. Securing a committed student who ranks me first, even if they are my 4th choice, is a strong move in Round 1, guaranteeing my quota is filled. I will accept Student_D."

Student_B has applied in Round 1, stating that School_A is their absolute first choice.\n\nWhile Student_A is my top priority, Student_A prefers School_B over School_A, meaning Student_A likely applied to School_B this round. If School_B accepts Student_A (which is likely, as Student_A is high on School_B's priority list), Student_A will be off the market.\n\nAccepting Student_B (Rank #2) secures a high-quality match immediately, especially since they prioritize School_A highly.

Student_E is the only student who ranks School_E first and is applying persistently (this is their second application). Given the high probability that all higher-ranked students will match elsewhere, and the risk of remaining unmatched if I reject Student_E again, accepting Student_E now secures a match and fulfills the quota. Although Student_E is the lowest priority, securing a guaranteed match is preferable to remaining unmatched when higher priority students are highly unlikely to become available."
