Since School_D has a quota of 1, they should accept the only applicant, regardless of my priority rank (I am 4th).

Student_D is ranked P4 on my list. Student_D has applied with [APPLY] and states School_D is their top preference (P1). Since this is Round 1, and no higher priority students (A, B, C) have contacted me, accepting Student_D secures a match immediately. Students A, B, and C all rank School_D low on their lists (P4 or P5), meaning they likely applied to other schools (A/B/C) this round. Rejecting Student_D now carries a high risk of being unmatched, as securing a student ranked P1, P2, or P3 later depends on multiple rejections from other schools. Securing a match with a highly committed P4 student is a strong outcome for Round 1, guaranteeing my quota is met."

This leaves School_E likely receiving only my application. Although I have the lowest priority (P5) for School_E, if I am the only applicant, I should secure the spot.

Student_C is my 3rd priority. Student_C has applied ([APPLY]) and stated I am their absolute top choice (Rank 1 preference).\n\nWhile Student_A (Rank 1) and Student_B (Rank 2) are higher priorities, they are likely applying to their top choices (S_A -> S_B/S_A; S_B -> S_A/S_C). Given that S_B and S_A have strong competing interests, waiting might result in losing Student_C (who is highly motivated) without securing a higher-ranked student.\n\nSecuring a match with a Rank 3 student in Round 1 is a strong, risk-averse move, especially since this student considers me their top choice. I will accept Student_C to guarantee a match at Priority 3, rather than risking ending up with a lower rank or no match by holding out for S_A or S_B."
