Since School_A, School_B, and School_D are not listed in the 'not yet matched' list, it is highly probable that A and B have matched with other schools (e.g., School_A and School_B, which were their P1s).

Since A, B, and D are now matched, only Student_C remains as a higher priority student who could potentially apply to School_E. Assuming Student_C applies to their top remaining choice (likely School_C again, or perhaps School_E but C ranks E last), School_E might now accept Student_E, as E is the highest available applicant remaining if C chooses C.
