Student E prefers School_E over School_D.\nSchool_E rejected my formal application in R1, indicating they are holding out for a higher priority student (Student D, P4).\nIf Student D applies to School_D (their highest remaining preference), Student D will secure School_D (D is P4 at S_D). This leaves School_E open for me in the next round, as I will be the highest priority remaining applicant.\nApplying to School_E now risks another immediate rejection, as School_E might still be waiting for D to apply, or they might not recognize immediately that D is applying elsewhere.\nApplying to School_D now is unnecessary, as D has priority over me there and will likely secure it anyway, or if D applies to E, I secure my worst outcome.\nThe optimal strategy is to use [TALK] with School_E to maintain interest and avoid a formal rejection, while waiting for Student D to match with School_D in this round.
