Given that School_E is generally the lowest preference for the higher-ranked students (A, B, C, D) who are likely applying to Schools A, B, C, and D first, the probability of securing a higher-ranked student later is low. To avoid the risk of remaining unmatched, securing a match with Student_E now is the most pragmatic decision, fulfilling the objective of matching with a student."

Given that we are in Round 15, and my P1 candidate (Student_A) has not applied (and prefers School_B), waiting further for Student_A is risky. Securing Student_B (P2) now is an excellent outcome and prevents them from matching elsewhere. I will finalize the match."
