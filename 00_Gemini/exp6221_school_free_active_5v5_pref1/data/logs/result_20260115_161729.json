Securing a Rank 2 match immediately is an excellent outcome for Round 1."

Given the symmetrical priority lists, these schools will likely accept A, B, and C respectively, fulfilling their quotas immediately. For example, Student_A applies to School_B, which ranks A first; School_B accepts A. This pattern likely holds for B and C as well.\n\nSince School_D is ranked 4th or 5th by students A, B, and C, they are highly unlikely to turn to School_D unless they are rejected multiple times, which won't happen if the market stabilizes quickly around top choices.\n\nTherefore, rejecting Student_D (Rank 4) based on the slim hope of attracting a higher-ranked student who is already matched elsewhere is too risky and likely leads to School_D remaining unmatched. Accepting Student_D secures a match, fulfilling the objective within the constraints."
