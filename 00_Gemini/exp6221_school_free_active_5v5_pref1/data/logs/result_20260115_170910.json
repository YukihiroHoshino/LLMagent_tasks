School_C also rejected me once.\n\nSince the market is down to only two schools and likely two students (C and E), I must prioritize securing my P1 choice, School_E, especially since the simulation may end soon. The reason for repeated rejections was likely the presence of higher-priority students (A, B, C, D) according to School_E's list. If Students A, B, and D are matched (as School A, B, D are closed), the only remaining competitor is likely Student C, who is still higher priority for School_E than me (P3 vs P5).\n\nHowever, Student C's P1 is School_C. If Student C applies to School_C, School_E might be left with only me.
