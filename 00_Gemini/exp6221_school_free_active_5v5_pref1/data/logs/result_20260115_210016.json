Student_E correctly points out that it is highly probable that the four students ranked above them (S_A, S_B, S_C, S_D) have already secured matches, given that all schools prioritize them highly. Waiting longer increases the significant risk of failing to fill the quota entirely. Since Student_E is highly committed (School_E is their Rank 1 choice) and is the only applicant in this round, accepting them now secures a match and fulfills the quota, mitigating the risk of being left unmatched.
