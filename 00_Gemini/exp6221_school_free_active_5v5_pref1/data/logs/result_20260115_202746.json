Given that we are in Round 17, and higher-priority students (A, B, C, D) rank School_E very low (4th or 5th), it is highly probable that they have matched elsewhere. Student_E has been applying repeatedly, and I have been accepting repeatedly since Round 5, indicating a stable, albeit low-priority, agreement. To secure a match and prevent the simulation from running indefinitely while hoping for unavailable higher-ranked students, I must finalize the match with Student_E."
