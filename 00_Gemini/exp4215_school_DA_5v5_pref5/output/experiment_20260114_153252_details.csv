I verified this by calculating the stable matching based on all agents submitting their true preferences:

2. Round 2: S_D proposes to School C. School C currently holds S_E. School C prefers S_D over S_E (S_D is 3rd priority, S_E is 4th). S_D is tentatively accepted.
3. Subsequent rounds confirm this placement (S_D holds School C until the end).

1. Calculate the outcome if Student_B submits the True Preference List (P_B = [A, B, C, D, E]) and all others are truthful. The stable matching M yields M(B) = School_D (Rank 4).

2. Analyze B's high priorities at preferred schools: School_A (4th priority), School_B (2nd priority), School_C (1st priority).
