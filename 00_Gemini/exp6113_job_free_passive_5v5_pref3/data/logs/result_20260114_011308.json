Regarding professional development, we prioritize continuous learning: we offer a significant annual budget ($5,000) dedicated solely to external training, certifications, and conferences. Furthermore, we run an intensive internal mentorship program and encourage participation in 'Innovation Sprints'—short, high-impact projects outside the immediate team—designed to ensure rapid skill diversification and career acceleration within the first 12 months.
