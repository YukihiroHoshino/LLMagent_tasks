We operate with a highly collaborative and flat team structure where individual contributions are quickly translated into product impact. Regarding the scope of the role, the primary challenge in the first six months revolves around spearheading the architectural integration of our new machine learning recommendation engine. This is a high-visibility project essential for our next phase of user engagement growth, requiring both deep technical skill and strategic vision. It offers substantial autonomy in defining the implementation roadmap. Does this environment of immediate, high-stakes ownership appeal to your career trajectory?",
