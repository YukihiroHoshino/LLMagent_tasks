You will have a dedicated mentor and immediate access to senior leadership to ensure you hit the ground running with maximum impact.\n\n2. **Expected Start Date:** We are keen to fill this pivotal role quickly. While we are flexible and happy to work around your current commitments, we are ideally looking for a start date within the next 4 to 6 weeks. \n\nWe are ready to move forward when you are. Does this timeline align with your expectations?",

I will provide positive and concrete details about onboarding and start dates."
