Performance feedback is integrated into the career path through a structured, ongoing process. Our quarterly performance reviews, which measure success against the metrics we previously outlined, directly feed into your personalized Individual Development Plan (IDP). This plan formalizes the steps needed for promotion, meaning that feedback doesn't just evaluate past performance, but actively sets the actionable goals (e.g., specific project leadership, mastering a new technology) required to achieve the next level in your career progression (e.g., Senior Engineer). We ensure there is a transparent path forward based on merit and demonstrated impact.
