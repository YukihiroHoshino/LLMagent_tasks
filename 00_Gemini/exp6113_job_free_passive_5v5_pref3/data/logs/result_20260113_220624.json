We operate in highly agile, cross-functional pods where engineers are embedded with product managers from the ideation phase onward. This ensures technical feasibility informs product roadmaps directly, and product needs are immediately reflected in implementation priorities. You would be joining a structure designed for maximum autonomy and direct impact on the final customer experience. Does this collaborative approach align with the kind of environment you thrive in?",
