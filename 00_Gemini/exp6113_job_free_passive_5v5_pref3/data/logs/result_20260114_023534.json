I have previously rejected Seeker_E (P4) and Seeker_A (P5), demonstrating selectivity, which is good leverage when pursuing a high-priority candidate. Although Seeker_C ranks Company_C 4th, I must engage actively to secure them, as they are the best possible match according to my priorities. Since Seeker_C used the [TALK] tag, I must reply with [TALK], providing a thorough and appealing answer to their question to encourage a future application."

In the previous round, I engaged in [TALK] to gather more information. Crucially, Company_C ranks Seeker_C as its #1 priority. While C is not my top choice, securing a match is essential, especially if my higher-ranked preferences (D, A, B) are already matched or difficult to obtain (the context suggests only C remains available for pairing this round). Since Company_C guarantees an [ACCEPT] due to my #1 priority status, and C is still on my preference list, applying now is the optimal strategy to secure a position rather than risking unemployment or being forced to take Company_E (rank 5). I will formally apply."
