Seeker_D, however, ranks Company_C as their top preference (Rank 1) and is applying immediately in Round 1. Accepting this strong, mutual interest match secures a highly ranked candidate (Rank 3) and prevents Seeker_D from being matched with Company_B or Company_D, who also prioritize them highly.

I have already engaged in two rounds of detailed conversation with Company_E. Since applying now would lock me into a lower preference while higher preferences are still unmatched, I should hold off on the formal application. I need to maintain interest with Company_E (as a safety net) without committing. A final 'TALK' message signaling readiness and high alignment is appropriate before potentially applying in a later round if my top choices don't materialize."

The typical onboarding timeline is a highly structured two-week period focused on deep dives into our current project architecture and team introductions, ensuring you are productive from day one. Given the critical nature of the scaling project we discussed, we are looking for the successful candidate to begin as soon as possible, ideally within the next three to four weeks.

I will answer their logistical question clearly and positively to encourage an application soon, maintaining the conversation status ([TALK])."

As we mentioned previously, we are operating with extremely limited capacity and are deeply invested in finalizing our decision with candidates whose specialized background aligns precisely with the immediate, highly niche requirements of our current strategic opening.
