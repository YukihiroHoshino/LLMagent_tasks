Since Seeker_A is still available and I only have one quota, I should keep the conversation with Seeker_E warm but avoid commitment, hoping to match with a higher-priority candidate later, especially Seeker_A. Seeker_E initiated [TALK], so I must respond with [TALK], providing substantive information to maintain interest."
