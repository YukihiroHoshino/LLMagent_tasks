Since it is Round 1 and I am guaranteed acceptance by applying, securing my 3rd choice immediately is a stable strategy, especially since my chances for my 1st and 2nd choices (Company_B and Company_D) are lower due to their priority lists placing me at Rank 3 and Rank 4, respectively.

While Seeker_C and Seeker_B are higher priorities for me, both rank Company_C very low (4th and 5th, respectively), making it highly unlikely they would match with me unless all their preferred companies are gone. Given that Seeker_D is a solid 3rd choice and guarantees a stable match immediately (Rank 1 preference from their side), accepting this offer early in Round 1 is the optimal strategy to secure a high-quality candidate and fulfill the quota, mitigating the risk of missing out entirely while waiting for highly unlikely matches (Seeker_C or Seeker_B)."
