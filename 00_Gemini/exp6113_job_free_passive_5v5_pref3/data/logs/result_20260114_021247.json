Our previous exchanges have confirmed a strong alignment between my qualifications and the needs of your team, and I remain highly impressed by the scope of your work. Given my confirmed enthusiasm and the excellent fit established through our discussions, I am now formally submitting my application for this role.",

Given that only Company_E remains unmatched in the market, and all higher-ranked companies (A, C, D, B) have secured matches, I must now apply to Company_E to avoid remaining unemployed. I have previously engaged in three rounds of 'TALK' to gauge interest and confirm fit, establishing a strong foundation. Since this is the final opportunity for a match, I will formally apply immediately."
