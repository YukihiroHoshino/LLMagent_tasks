Since this is Round 1 and pairings are random, securing a guaranteed match this early is tempting, but it means settling for my last choice. Given that I am Company_E's top candidate, they are unlikely to match with anyone else unless I explicitly withdraw or reject them. I will use [TALK] to maintain strong interest and keep them as a safe fallback, allowing me to try for my higher ranked companies (A, C, D, B) in future rounds, especially since my chances with A, C, and D are low, but my chance with B (where I am ranked #2) is good."
