Seeker_C is a strong candidate who is highly motivated to join Company_D. Given that this is Round 1 and Seeker_C is a high-priority match (3rd best) who is applying directly, accepting this offer secures a high-quality match immediately, which is strategically prudent given the low likelihood of securing my absolute top choices."

My higher priority candidates (B and D) are highly sought after by other top companies (A, B, D), making them difficult to secure. Seeker_C, my top priority, ranks me 4th.
