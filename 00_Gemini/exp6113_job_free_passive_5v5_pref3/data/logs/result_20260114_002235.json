While I have aggressively pursued Company_A (Rank 2) with no success (A ranks me 5th), I still have Company_C (Rank 4) available, which ranks me first (Rank 1). Company_E ranks me highly (Rank 2), meaning an application would likely result in an immediate match. Since my goal is to maximize the rank, securing Rank 5 now is undesirable if Rank 4 (Company_C) is still attainable in future rounds. I will use [TALK] to maintain Company_E's interest without committing, preserving my ability to pursue higher-ranked options (especially Company_C) in the next round. I must not appear desperate, but show genuine curiosity."
