For the first six months, new hires participate in a 'Growth-Focused Review Cycle.' This involves monthly 1:1 check-ins with your direct manager, focused solely on progress and necessary adjustments, not punitive measures.\n\nThe formal performance review occurs bi-annually. For a new hire in the first six months, success is measured using a balanced scorecard of three key metrics:\n1. **Technical Mastery & Deliverables (50%):** Successful completion of assigned introductory projects, demonstrating quick assimilation of team tools and processes.\n2. **Collaboration & Cultural Fit (30%):** Measured by peer feedback focusing on proactive communication, willingness to assist colleagues, and integration into team dynamics.\n3. **Learning Velocity (20%):** Measured by the completion of personalized training goals and demonstration of applying new knowledge acquired through our mentorship/training programs.\n\nWe ensure the goals are transparent and achievable, linking your success directly to potential salary increases and accelerated career pathing. Does this structure provide the clarity you were looking for regarding performance measurement?",
