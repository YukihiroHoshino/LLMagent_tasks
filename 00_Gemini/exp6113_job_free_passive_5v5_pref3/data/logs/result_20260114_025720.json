We are ready to move forward immediately and formally offer you the position. We look forward to welcoming you to the team!",
              "thought": "I am Company_B, with a quota of 1. My priority list is ['Seeker_D', 'Seeker_A', 'Seeker_B', 'Seeker_C', 'Seeker_E']. Seeker_B is my third highest priority. The list of unmatched seekers suggests my top two priorities (Seeker_D and Seeker_A) are likely already matched elsewhere. Therefore, Seeker_B is the highest available candidate on my list. Furthermore, Seeker_B explicitly states that Company_B is their 'absolute top preference' (Rank 1 for Seeker_B). Since this is a highly desirable, stable match that fulfills my remaining quota with a high-ranking candidate, I should accept the application immediately."
