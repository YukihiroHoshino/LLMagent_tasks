Seeker_D, however, ranks Company_D last (Rank 5). It is highly likely that Seeker_D has already matched with a higher preference company (C, A, or B). Furthermore, my pursuit of Company_B (Rank 2) has been unsuccessful due to my low priority (Rank 5) there. Given the high probability of acceptance and the acceptable rank of Company_D, I should apply immediately to secure this match before Company_D is potentially matched with Seeker_C or Seeker_B (whom they rank 3rd and 4th, respectively)."
