The 30% efficiency increase you achieved is precisely the kind of measurable impact we are looking for. To directly answer your question: yes, expertise in Project X is absolutely crucial and prioritized for this role. We are very pleased with the depth of skills you have demonstrated so far. We are finalizing our internal review of all candidates who have engaged in conversation, and we highly value your continued interest as we move toward the final stages of selection.",

Seeker_A is currently using the [TALK] tag, expressing strong interest and confirming skill alignment but not yet applying. Since my quota is 1, I must reserve it for a higher priority candidate, ideally Seeker_C. I need to reply with [TALK] to maintain engagement with Seeker_A (as a viable backup) while avoiding encouraging an immediate application that would force me to reject them prematurely (potentially souring the relationship) or accept them (blocking my chance with Seeker_C). I will confirm the relevance of their expertise without committing to an offer timeline."
