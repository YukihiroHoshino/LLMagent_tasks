Since the simulation is already in Round 5 and several companies (A, B, D, implicitly) are likely matched, the pool of competitors for Company_C might be reduced. I will submit a formal application [APPLY] to maximize my chance of acceptance."

The key challenges in the first six months involve leading the strategic overhaul of our data infrastructure and implementing a new proprietary machine learning pipeline—initiatives directly tied to our market expansion goals next year.
