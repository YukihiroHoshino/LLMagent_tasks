Since Company_C ranks me as P1, I have a strong incentive to wait and try to secure a match with C, which is a higher preference. Company_E ranks me P2, so I am a strong candidate there too, but I should not commit yet. Since I have already used three TALK messages, a fourth TALK message is appropriate to keep the conversation alive and maintain Company_E as a backup option without applying prematurely to my lowest preference."

Our onboarding process is designed to be highly efficient and supportive. It begins immediately upon acceptance with digital access to proprietary resources, followed by a week-long personalized immersion program focused on Project Zenith's architecture and team introductions, ensuring you are fully prepared to take ownership on day one. Regarding the anticipated start date, while we are eager to have you join immediately, we offer flexibility, typically targeting a start within 2 to 4 weeks post-offer acceptance, allowing for necessary transitions. We are prepared to align this timeline with your specific needs.",

Seeker_C's continuous use of [TALK] tags and detailed questions about onboarding and start dates indicate they are extremely close to making a decision/application. I must provide a final, appealing response to secure this high-priority candidate, as waiting too long risks losing them to another company. Since I have not yet secured my top choice (Seeker_A), I will continue to engage positively, answering their final logistical questions to ensure they feel confident applying in the next round. If they apply, I will accept."

Crucially, I have analyzed Company_C's priority list, and I am listed as their absolute top priority (Seeker_C is #1). Given that my top 3 preferences (D, A, B) are likely matched or unavailable, securing a match with Company_C (a guaranteed acceptance) is a strategically sound move to prevent being forced into a match with Company_E (my last preference) or remaining unmatched. I will formally apply."
