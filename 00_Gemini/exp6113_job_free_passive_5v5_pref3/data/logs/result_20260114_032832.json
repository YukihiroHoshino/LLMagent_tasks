Seeker_E (P2) and potentially Seeker_D (P1) are still unmatched and available (based on the provided unmatched list, Seeker_E is definitely available). My goal is to maximize the rank of the matched seeker. Since P2 (Seeker_E) is higher than P3 (Seeker_C), I will reject Seeker_C to keep my quota open for a higher-ranked candidate, especially Seeker_E. Seeker_C ranks me as P1, so rejecting them is a calculated risk that they will remain unmatched or circle back if their other options fall through, allowing me to pursue P2."
