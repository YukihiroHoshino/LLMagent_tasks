Seeker_C has sent an [APPLY] action and ranks Company_D as their 1st choice. While Seeker_D (P1) and Seeker_E (P2) are higher, they rank Company_D very low (5th and 4th, respectively), making a successful match with them highly uncertain, especially in Round 1. Securing a P3 candidate who is highly motivated (P1 preference for me) in the first round is a very strong, stable outcome and maximizes my utility given the constraints and preferences of the top two seekers.
