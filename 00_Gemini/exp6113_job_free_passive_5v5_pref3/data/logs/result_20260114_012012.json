My top two targets (Seeker_C and Seeker_B) rank me very low (4th and 5th respectively) and are highly sought after by other companies (A, B, D). Rejecting Seeker_D risks losing a high-quality candidate who strongly prefers me, potentially forcing me to settle for lower priorities (Seeker_E or Seeker_A) later, or ending up unmatched if the market clears quickly.
