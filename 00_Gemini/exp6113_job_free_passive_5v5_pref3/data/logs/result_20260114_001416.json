Since this is Round 1, and I still have three higher-ranked companies potentially available, I want to preserve my flexibility. However, Company_B ranks me highly (2nd overall). Applying now would secure a match (rank 4), but it would prevent me from matching with my top three choices if I get paired with them later. Given the early stage of the simulation, using [TALK] is the optimal strategy.

Since it is only Round 1, I must prioritize keeping my application slot open for higher-ranked companies. Applying to Company_E now risks locking in a suboptimal match.
