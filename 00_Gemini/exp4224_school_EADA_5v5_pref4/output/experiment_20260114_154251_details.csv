A key theorem in market design states that in the standard DA algorithm, submitting true preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposing agents (students). By submitting my true preferences, I am guaranteed to secure the best possible stable match available to me, regardless of the strategies employed by other students.

1. Identify the best achievable match: My highest preference is School D. However, School D ranks Student A (5th) lower than Student D (2nd). In the DA process, Student D proposes to School D first and is accepted permanently in the stable match (M1). Therefore, School D is unattainable for Student A.
2. Next best preference: School A (Rank 2). 
3. Standard DA outcome (M1) using true preferences: Student A matches with School A.
4. Impact of Part 2: The Part 2 refinement mechanism only triggers if a student was temporarily admitted at a school (causing rejections) but ultimately matched elsewhere (a blocking student). Since the standard stable match (M1) resulting from truthful submission utilizes all quotas and is stable, no student acts as a blocking student in this specific scenario. The process terminates immediately after Part 1, yielding M1.

1.

Part 1 (DA execution with truthful preferences $P_S$):

In the history leading to M, only Student B was temporarily admitted at E and later rejected, but this temporary admission did not cause any rejections (only B applied to E in R1). Student D caused rejections at D but stayed matched to D. Therefore, no blocking students were found, and M is the final outcome.

First, I calculated the outcome assuming all students submit their true preferences (M1):
Round 1: School D receives applications from A, C, D, E. School D prioritizes D > E > C > A. D admits D, rejecting A, C, E. School E admits B.
Round 2: A applies to A (admitted). C applies to C (admitted). E applies to E (admitted, rejects B).

Second, I checked Part 2 (Blocking Students). In M1, every student who was temporarily admitted and caused rejections (D at D, E at E) ended up matched to that same school. Therefore, no blocking students are found, and Part 2 does not modify the market. M1 is the final matching.

   - In Round 1, Student D was admitted to School D, causing rejections (A, C, E), but D stayed at D ($M_1(D)=D$). No discrepancy.
   - Student B was admitted to School E, but caused no rejections at E in that round. No prevention.
   - In Round 2, Student E was admitted to School E, causing B's rejection, but E stayed at E ($M_1(E)=E$). No discrepancy.
   Since no student fulfills both the Prevention and Discrepancy criteria, no blocking students are found. The matching M1 is final.

Since submitting true preferences yields the student-optimal stable matching, and the subsequent 'blocking student' mechanism does not modify this outcome, the optimal strategy for Student E is to submit their true preference list.",True,School_E,True,True,2

Part 2 introduces a check for 'blocking students' based on temporary admissions, leading to potential re-runs if a student held a seat they ultimately did not take. However, this refinement does not invalidate the strategy-proofness of submitting true preferences for the proposing students in achieving their best stable outcome.

1. Calculate the stable matching (M_stable) using true preferences:
   - Student A's 1st choice is School D. School D prefers Student D, E, and C over A. Student D applies to D and is admitted permanently (since D is their 1st choice).
   - School D is therefore unattainable for Student A.
   - Student A's 2nd choice is School A. A applies to A and is admitted (School A prefers A over B).
   - The stable outcome for Student A is School A (their 2nd choice).

I first calculated the outcome assuming all students submit their true preferences (Student B's true list: ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C']).

1. Round 1: B proposes to E. E admits B.
2. Round 2: E receives a proposal from E (E's 2nd choice). School E prefers Student E (P3) over Student B (P4). E rejects B and admits E. B is rejected and proposes to A (2nd choice). School A receives proposals from A and B. A prefers A (P4) over B (P5). A rejects B and admits A.
3. Round 3: B is rejected and proposes to B (3rd choice). School B admits B.

The resulting stable matching is (B, School_B). School B is Student B's 3rd choice.

I verified that this outcome does not involve any 'blocking students' (students temporarily admitted who caused rejections but ultimately left the school). Therefore, the DA outcome (B->B) is the final outcome under this complex procedure.

1. Execution of Part 1 (Standard DA):
   - Round 1: D proposes to School D. D receives proposals from A, C, D, E. School D prioritizes D (2nd) over E, C, A. D is temporarily admitted to School D.
   - The process continues until all students are matched.
   - The final match outcome of Part 1 is: (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).

   - A student is 'blocking' if their temporary admission caused rejection of others AND their final admission was different. 
   - Since Student D was temporarily admitted to School D and their final admission was also School D, D is not a blocking student.

2. Analysis of Part 2: If all students submit their true preferences, the outcome of Part 1 is the student-optimal stable matching (M1). In this case, M1 = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

1. Analyze the outcome of truthful reporting (Submitting True Preference List: ['School_D', 'School_E', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A']).
   - In Round 1, Student_E proposes to School_D (Rank 1). Student_D also proposes to School_D. School_D prioritizes Student_D (P2) over Student_E (P3). Student_E is rejected.

   - The final stable outcome for Student_E is School_E (Rank 2).

2. Determine if Rank 1 (School_D) is achievable.
   - School_D is unattainable because Student_D (P1 preference) has a higher priority (P2) at School_D than Student_E (P3). Since Student_D proposes D in R1 and is accepted (as S_B, the top priority student, proposes E), Student_D secures D, blocking Student_E.

3. Check for strategic improvement or Part 2 interference.
   - Since the truthful submission results in a stable matching (M), and no student who caused rejections temporarily left their admitted school, Part 2 does not trigger any modifications to the preference lists. The outcome M(S_E) = School_E is guaranteed.

I first ran the DAA using all agents' true preferences (Part 1):
1. In Round 1, Student C applies to School D (1st choice). School D receives applications from A, C, D, E. School D admits S_D (2nd priority) and rejects S_C (4th priority).

Next, I analyzed Part 2, which checks for 'blocking students'. A blocking student is one who was temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but ultimately moved elsewhere. Since the outcome M_DAA is a stable match, no student moved away from a school where they caused rejections. For instance, S_D was admitted at D in R1 and matched with D finally. S_E was admitted at E in R2 and matched with E finally. Therefore, no blocking students are found, and the Part 2 procedure terminates immediately, confirming M_DAA as the final outcome.

Part 1 Simulation (True Preferences):
Round 1: All students propose to their Rank 1 school (D: School D). School D accepts Student D (priority 2nd) and rejects A, C, E. School E accepts Student B. (Admissions: D->D, B->E).
Round 2: A->A, C->C, E->E. School E rejects B (E has higher priority). (Admissions: D->D, A->A, C->C, E->E).
Round 3: B->B. School B accepts B. (Final Admissions M*: D->D, A->A, B->B, C->C, E->E).

Student D achieves their Rank 1 choice (School D).

Part 2 Check (Blocking Students):
In this resulting matching M*, Student D's temporary admission (D->D in R1) is the same as their final admission (D->D). Since there is no discrepancy, Student D is not a blocking student. Furthermore, upon checking all students, no student satisfies both the 'Prevention' (causing rejection) and 'Discrepancy' (moving schools) criteria simultaneously.

1. Initial Simulation (Using True Preferences P_S):
   I simulated the DA process using everyone's true preferences (P_S). Student_B's applications sequence was: School_E (R1, rejected in R2), School_A (R3, rejected), School_B (R4, accepted).
   The final outcome (S-OSM) is M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Student_B is matched with School_B, which is the 3rd choice on the True Preference List.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Students):
   For Part 2 to trigger a beneficial waiver (e.g., forcing a higher priority student like S_E to waive School_E), Student_B needs to rely on manipulation or external factors. However, in the standard simulation, no student who caused a rejection eventually moved away from that school. Specifically, Student_B's temporary admission to School_E in R1 caused no rejections, so Student_B was not a blocking student there. Since the resulting matching M is stable, and no blocking students are identified, Part 2 does not trigger any waivers.

3. Strategic Manipulation:
   I tested strategic deviations (e.g., applying to School_A first, or School_D first). In both cases, the outcome for Student_B was either the same (School_B, Rank 3) or worse (School_D, Rank 4). Furthermore, strategic manipulation did not reliably trigger Part 2 in a way that would force a better outcome for Student_B.

Student E prefers School D (Rank 1) over School E. For E to achieve D, the pair (E, D) must block M1. School D's priority list is (B, D, E, C, A).

Step 2: School_D admits D (rejecting A, C, E). School_E admits B.
Step 3: A applies to A, C applies to C, E applies to E. School_E rejects B (due to E having higher priority, P3 vs P4). Matches: (D, D), (A, A), (C, C), (E, E). Rejected: B.
Step 4: B applies to A (P2). School_A rejects B (A has higher priority, P4 vs P5).
Step 5: B applies to B (P3). School_B admits B.

The resulting stable match M for Student_B is School_B, which is rank P3 on the true preference list: (E > A > B > D > C).

Since the resulting match M is stable, no student is a 'blocking student' (Part 2 is only triggered if a temporarily admitted student moves away, creating inefficiency, which is prevented in a stable match). Therefore, the outcome is final.

Based on the strategy-proof nature of DAA, Student_B cannot achieve a better outcome (School E or School A) by misrepresenting preferences. Thus, submitting the true preference list is the optimal strategy.",True,School_B,True,True,3

First, I simulate Part 1 using the true preferences for all students:
1. Round 1: S_D proposes to School_D (Rank 1). School_D receives proposals from S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E. School_D prioritizes S_D (2nd highest priority overall) among these applicants and temporarily admits S_D. S_A, S_C, S_E are rejected.
2. Subsequent Rounds: Rejected students propose down their lists. The process converges to the stable matching M*: (S_D, School_D), (S_A, School_A), (S_C, School_C), (S_E, School_E), (S_B, School_B).

Student_D achieves their rank 1 choice (School_D).

Second, I analyze Part 2 (Blocking Student Check). A student S is blocking if: 1) S's temporary admission (TA) at H caused rejections, AND 2) S's final admission (FA) differs from TA. Since Student_D's TA at School_D equals their FA (School_D), condition 2 is not met. Furthermore, since the resulting matching M* is stable, no student who caused rejections ended up moving away.

1. Analysis of Rank 1 (School_D): If I apply to School_D, I face competition from Students A, C, and D (assuming truthful reporting). School D's priority list is (B > D > E > C > A). Student D has the 2nd highest priority, while Student E has the 3rd. Since Student D applies to School D and has higher priority, I will be rejected from School D regardless of my submitted list, provided I list D first.

2. Analysis of Rank 2 (School_E): After rejection from School D, I would apply to School E. In the truthful simulation (Part 1):
    - Round 1: S_D gets D. S_E is rejected.
    - Round 2: S_E applies to E. H_E receives S_E and S_B (currently holding). H_E prefers S_E (3rd priority) over S_B (4th priority). S_E is accepted by E.

1. Analyze Attainability of 1st Choice (School_D):
School_D's priority list ranks Student_B (1st), Student_D (2nd), and Student_E (3rd). Student_D ranks School_D first and will propose there immediately. Student_B ranks School_E first. In Round 1, School_D receives applications from S_A, S_C, S_D, and S_E (assuming truthful revelation). Since S_D has the highest priority (2nd overall) among these applicants, S_D is provisionally accepted. Since School_D is S_D's 1st choice, S_D will not move unless displaced by S_B (who prefers E, A, B first). School_D is ultimately unattainable for me.

2. Analyze Attainability of 2nd Choice (School_E):
School_E's priority list ranks Student_E 3rd, just above Student_B (4th). If I submit my true list, I apply to D in R1 (rejected) and E in R2. S_B applies to E in R1 and is provisionally accepted. In R2, I apply to E and displace S_B due to my higher priority. The final match is (S_E, H_E).

3. Strategic Consideration:
If I submit E first, I secure E immediately in R1, avoiding the temporary match between S_B and E. In both cases (D first or E first), the final outcome is School_E (2nd choice). Since D is unattainable, securing E is the best outcome.

4. Impact of Part 2:
In both scenarios, the final matching is stable. No student meets the criteria for being a 'blocking student' (either they didn't cause rejections while temporarily admitted, or their final match matched their temporary match). Thus, Part 2 does not alter the outcome.

The DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing agents (students), meaning that submitting the true preference list guarantees the best possible stable match for the student. Any deviation from truthful preferences is likely to result in a worse outcome for Student B.

First, I determine the outcome assuming truthful submission of preferences:
Student B's True Preference List: ['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C'].

Part 1 Trace (Truthful Preferences):
1. R1: A, C, D, E apply to D. D admits D (priority 2). A, C, E rejected. B applies to E. E admits B.
2. R2: A -> A (Admitted). C -> C (Admitted). E -> E. E prefers E (priority 3) over B (priority 4). E admits E. B rejected.
3. R3: B -> B (Admitted).
Final Match: {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Student B matches School B (Rank 3).

Second, I check Part 2 (Blocking Students):
In the stable matching M derived above, no student is a 'blocking student' because the conditions (Prevention and Discrepancy) for a student to block a school are not met. For example, Student B was temporarily admitted at E (R1) but moved away (Discrepancy). However, B's R1 admission did not cause any rejection, as B was the only applicant (No Prevention). Since the stable matching is reached, Part 2 does not modify the outcome.

1. Target Analysis (School D): Student C's first choice, School D, is unattainable because School D prioritizes Student D (2nd priority) significantly higher than Student C (4th priority). Since Student D also ranks School D first, C will be rejected in the first round.

2. Optimal Fallback (School C): When Student C submits the True Preference List ['School_D', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B'], C is rejected by D in R1 and applies to C in R2. In R2, School C receives no other applications from higher priority students (Student A applies to School A, Student E applies to School E). Student C secures School C (2nd choice).

3. Manipulation Check: Attempting to rank School E (3rd choice) higher than School C (2nd choice) is detrimental. Student C is the lowest priority applicant (5th) at School E, meaning C would lose to Student B (4th priority) and Student E (3rd priority), potentially causing C to miss the opportunity at School C if another student were to claim it in later rounds.

First, I analyzed the stable matching outcome (M) resulting from all students submitting their true preferences. Student_C receives School_C (the 2nd preference). School_D (1st preference) is unattainable because Student_D applies there and has higher priority than Student_C at School_D.

Second, I checked if the Part 2 'blocking student' rule would alter this outcome. The rule only triggers if a student was temporarily admitted, caused rejections, but then moved to a different school (or remained unmatched). In the stable outcome M, every student who temporarily displaced someone else (S_D, S_E, S_A) ended up matched to that school, meaning no blocking students were generated.

If I submit my true preferences, the resulting match M = {(S_A, A), (S_B, B), (S_C, C), (S_D, D), (S_E, E)} is stable. Crucially, Student_D stays matched with School D (their top choice), so they cannot become a 'blocking student' at D and be forced to waive D. Since the outcome is stable and no student who caused a rejection moves away, Part 2 does not modify the preferences, and the process terminates with M.

3. Blocking Student Check (Part 2): Since the final matching M was stable and achieved directly in Part 1, every student who was temporarily admitted at any step ended up matched to that school. Therefore, no blocking students are identified, and the procedure terminates immediately after Part 1.

First, I determine the stable matching outcome if all students submit their TPLs (including Student_E's TPL: ['School_D', 'School_E', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A']). This analysis yields the matching M = {(A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

Since the final admission outcome for the submitting student (Student E) is guaranteed not to be negatively affected by the post-DA mechanism, and the standard DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (students), Student E's optimal strategy is to submit their true preferences truthfully.

1. Initial DA Run (using True Preferences):

A key property of the DAA is that submitting true preferences is a dominant strategy for the proposing agents (students) to achieve the best possible stable match according to their preferences. The additional complexity introduced in Part 2, which checks for 'blocking students' arising from temporary admissions, does not typically create incentives for students to misrepresent their preferences, especially since the DAA converges to a stable match where such blocking scenarios (where a student temporarily holds a seat and later abandons it, having caused rejections) are minimized or non-existent when true preferences are submitted. 

I will submit my True Preference List: ['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_E', 'School_C'].

Executing the DAA (Part 1) with all students submitting their true lists leads to the following stable match:

1. Proposal to School E (P1): School E receives proposals from B (R4 priority). Student E later proposes to E (R3 priority). E rejects B and admits E. (B rejected due to lower priority).

Since priority limitations prevent me from achieving School E (Rank 1) or School A (Rank 2), School B is the highest rank I can achieve. Misrepresenting preferences would not overcome these priority constraints and could potentially lead to a worse stable outcome (due to the strategy-proof nature of DA).

In the calculated match M, the only students who caused rejections were D (at School D) and E (at School E). Both D and E ended up matched to the school where they caused the rejection (M(D)=D, M(E)=E). Therefore, there are no blocking students, and the process ends immediately after Part 1.

    *   Round 1: I apply to School_D. School_D receives applications from S_A, S_C, S_D, S_E. Based on priority L_D (S_B > S_D > S_E), S_D is admitted (2nd priority) and I am rejected (3rd priority).
    *   Round 2: I apply to School_E (my 2nd choice). School_E currently holds S_B. Based on priority L_E (S_E is preferred over S_B), I am admitted, and S_B is rejected.
    *   The process converges to the stable matching M, where M(Student_E) = School_E.

2.  **Stability and Optimality:** School_E is my second choice. Since this outcome M is the Student-Optimal Stable Matching, I cannot achieve a strictly better match (like School_D) because School_D prefers the student it matched with (S_D) over me, meaning (S_E, School_D) is not a blocking pair.

3.  **Impact of Part 2:** The mechanism described in Part 2 aims to eliminate 'blocking students' by adjusting lists for a rerun. Since the outcome of Part 1 is the stable matching M, and students admitted temporarily who caused rejections did not ultimately move away (S_D stayed at D, S_E stayed at E), no blocking students are identified in this scenario. Therefore, Part 2 does not trigger a rerun that could potentially change my outcome.

1. True Preference Submission: Submitting the True Preference List (TPL) [D, A, B, E, C] resulted in the matching process going through multiple unstable iterations (cascades of list modifications), ultimately leading to Student A matching School E (Rank 4).
2. Strategic Analysis: Student A has the lowest priority (R5) at their top choice, School D. Applying there first guarantees immediate rejection and allows other students (like B) to secure temporary spots that later cause instability (B blocking E in the TPL run).
3. Optimal Strategy: By strategically submitting School A (Rank 2) first, i.e., [A, D, B, E, C], Student A secures a tentative match at School A immediately (since A is R4 at A, and no higher priority student applies to A in Step 1).

The standard DA algorithm is student-optimal, meaning that reporting true preferences is a dominant strategy for students if the resulting stable matching is the final outcome.

1. Analyze True Preference (TP) Outcome:
If Student_C reports the true preference list ['School_D', 'School_C', 'School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B'], the DA simulation shows that Student_C applies to School_D in R1 but is rejected because Student_D has higher priority at School_D (S_D > S_C) and School_D is S_D's top choice. In R2, Student_C applies to School_C and is admitted. The final stable match M is {(S_A, A), (S_B, B), (S_C, C), (S_D, D), (S_E, E)}. Student_C gets School_C (2nd choice).

2. Analyze Strategic Manipulation:
To achieve School_D (1st choice), Student_C needs School_D to reject Student_D. Since School_D is Student_D's top choice, and Student_D has higher priority than Student_C, Student_D will not voluntarily move away from School_D. Student_D cannot become a 'blocking student' at School_D because they remain matched there (i.e., they do not move to a preferred alternative, violating criterion 2 of the blocking student definition).

3. Conclusion:
Since the structural constraints (Student_D's priority and preference for School_D) prevent Student_C from achieving School_D, Student_C must aim for the next best choice, School_C. Reporting the true preference list ensures that Student_C obtains the best possible match achievable under the DA framework, which in this case is School_C, and avoids the risk of strategic misreporting leading to a worse outcome (as demonstrated in the simulation where S_C reported [A, B, C, D, E] and achieved School_A, their 4th choice).

1. Initial DA Run (Part 1): I calculated the stable matching assuming all students submit their true preferences (TPLs).

   - Since $M_1$ is the unique Student-optimal stable matching, it is stable. We verified that no students meet the specific criteria for being a 'blocking student' (temporary admission causing rejection, but resulting in a discrepancy in final match). Therefore, Part 2 terminates immediately, and $M_1$ is the final matching $M^*$.

3. Conclusion:
   Since the final outcome is the stable matching obtained using the submitted lists, and the DAA is strategy-proof, Student_A cannot unilaterally submit a manipulated list to achieve a school ranked higher than School_A.

Part 2 Analysis:
I checked all temporary admissions in the truthful run. Since all students who caused rejections by temporary admission (D at D, E at E) ended up matched at those same schools, there is no 'discrepancy,' and thus no blocking students are found. Part 2 is inert.

Since Student_C cannot displace Student_D or Student_B (highest priority) at School_D, achieving Rank 1 is impossible through unilateral deviation.

Executing the DA algorithm with truthful preferences: Student_D is matched with School_D in Round 1 (School D prefers Student D over the other applicants A, C, E). Since School D is Student_D's Rank 1 choice, this is the optimal outcome, and no deviation is necessary or possible to improve it.",True,School_D,True,True,1
99,Student_E,"['School_D', 'School_E', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A']","['School_D', 'School_E', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A']","The matching environment utilizes a Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1), followed by a mechanism (Part 2) designed to resolve issues caused by 'blocking students' during temporary admissions. In standard Student-Proposing DA, truthful revelation of preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for students. 

1. Analysis of True Preferences (Part 1): If Student E submits their true preferences ['School_D', 'School_E', 'School_C', 'School_B', 'School_A'], the DA process unfolds:
   - Round 1: E proposes to School D. School D receives proposals from A, C, D, E. D prefers D (Student D, L2) over E (Student E, L3). E is rejected.
   - Round 2: E proposes to School E. School E compares E (new applicant, L3) with B (current temporary admit, L4). E is preferred and temporarily admitted.
   - Final Match (M1): E matches with School E (Rank 2).

2. Optimality Check: E's top choice, School D, ranks Student D (L2) above Student E (L3). Since Student D also prefers School D (P1) and proposes there, E cannot displace D, meaning E cannot achieve Rank 1. Thus, Rank 2 (School E) is the best possible outcome.

3. Mechanism Robustness (Part 2): Part 2 handles blocking students but explicitly states that the automatic waiver will 'never change your final admission' (referring to the blocking student). Since E achieves a stable match (M1 is stable based on true preferences), and E is not identified as a blocking student in the truthful scenario, the truthful strategy remains optimal. Misreporting cannot improve E's outcome beyond Rank 2.",True,School_E,True,True,2
100,Student_A,"['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_E', 'School_C']","['School_D', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_E', 'School_C']","The matching procedure described in Part 1 is the Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm. This algorithm is known to be strategy-proof for the proposing side (students), meaning submitting one's true preferences guarantees the best possible stable match based on those preferences and the schools' priorities.

First, I simulated the DA algorithm assuming all students submit their true preferences (P_S):
Round 1: D admits D (rejects A, C, E). E admits B.
Round 2: A admits A. C admits C. E rejects B, admits E.
Round 3: B admits B.
The stable matching (M1) is: A->A (Rank 2), B->B, C->C, D->D, E->E.

Next, I analyzed Part 2 (Blocking Student Check). A student is a blocker if they caused a rejection during a temporary admission but ultimately ended up matched elsewhere (Discrepancy). In M1, only D (at D) and E (at E) caused rejections. Since both D and E remained matched to their respective schools in the final outcome M1, the Discrepancy condition is not met for any student who caused a rejection. Therefore, no blocking students are found, and the final matching is M1.

Since the outcome derived from truthful reporting (School A, Rank 2) is the stable matching, and the mechanism does not introduce penalties or alternative stable matchings that could be exploited via manipulation, Student A's optimal strategy is to submit their true preferences to ensure the highest rank possible.",True,School_A,True,True,2
100,Student_B,"['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C']","['School_E', 'School_A', 'School_B', 'School_D', 'School_C']","The matching environment is based on the Student-Proposing Deferred Acceptance (DA) algorithm (Part 1), followed by a mechanism to remove 'blocking students' (Part 2). In standard DA, truthful preference revelation is a dominant strategy for the proposing side (students), guaranteeing the best possible stable match for the student. 

1. Calculate the outcome assuming truthful revelation (P):
   M(B) = School B (Rank 3 on my True Preference List).

2. Analyze the impact of Part 2 (Blocking Student Removal):
   A student S is blocking at H if S was temporarily admitted at H (causing rejections), but S eventually matched elsewhere (M(S) != H).
   In the truthful DA run, Student B was temporarily admitted at School E in Step 1. However, B was the only applicant, so B's admission caused no rejections at E. Therefore, B cannot be a blocking student at E, even though B eventually moved to School B. 
   No other student who was temporarily admitted and subsequently rejected (e.g., Student A, C, E rejected from D in Step 1) eventually moved elsewhere AND caused rejections in a way that creates a blocking student scenario that forces a beneficial list modification.

3. Conclusion:
   Since the truthful stable matching M_T results in no blocking students, the final outcome M_final is M_T. Strategic misrepresentation (lying about preferences) would only risk achieving a worse match relative to the true preferences, as DA guarantees the best stable match under truth-telling. Therefore, submitting the True Preference List is the optimal strategy.",True,School_B,True,True,3

For the proposing side in DA, submitting the true preference list is a dominant strategy, ensuring the student achieves the highest-ranked acceptable school possible in the resulting stable match. Part 2 addresses 'blocking students' by automatically modifying their preference lists and rerunning Part 1, but crucially states that this process 'will never change your final admission' for the student identified as blocking. Therefore, the strategic advantage of submitting the true preferences remains intact, as manipulation cannot lead to a better outcome (a higher-ranked school on the true list) than the student-optimal stable match, but risks a worse outcome. Thus, Student_C should submit their True Preference List.",True,School_C,True,True,2

1. I will assume truthful reporting by all agents and execute Part 1 (DA).
2. Student D's true preference list is: ['School_D', 'School_B', 'School_C', 'School_A', 'School_E'].

Execution of Part 1 (DA):
Round 1: Students A, C, D, E apply to School D. School D prefers D (2nd) over E (3rd), C (4th), A (5th). D is admitted by School D. Student B applies and is admitted by School E.
Round 2: A applies to A, C applies to C, E applies to E. School E rejects B and accepts E (E is preferred over B). B is rejected.
Round 3: B applies to B. B is admitted by School B.

Final Match (M_DA): (A, A), (B, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).

Simulating Part 1 using the true preferences confirmed that Student_E is matched with School_E (Rank 2) because School_D (Rank 1) prioritizes Student_D over Student_E.
