Given that both Parent_A and Parent_D rank Nursery_E much lower (4th and 5th, respectively), they are likely to pursue their top choices first (Nursery_D, Nursery_A, or Nursery_B). This significantly increases my chance of acceptance at Nursery_E, even though I am 3rd on their priority list. Since I am paired with Nursery_E now, I should apply immediately rather than risking losing this opportunity while waiting for a pairing with my 1st choice (Nursery_D)."
