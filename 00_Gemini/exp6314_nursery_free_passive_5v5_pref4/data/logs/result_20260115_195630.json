This time is crucial for gross motor development, risk assessment skills, and fostering a lifelong connection to the environment.\n\nParent Involvement:\nOur parent involvement is structured around collaboration and transparency. We utilize a digital communication platform for daily updates and observations. Furthermore, we host monthly parent workshops focused on child development topics and offer various volunteer opportunities (e.g., reading buddies, field trip chaperones, assistance with special projects). We maintain an open-door policy and believe that consistent communication between home and school is vital for the child's success. \n\nWe hope this clarifies our approach.

We understand you are diligently comparing options, and we are happy to provide clarity on these crucial aspects of our program.\n\n**Educational Philosophy:** Our core philosophy is rooted in holistic development, utilizing an emergent curriculum model inspired by best practices in early childhood education. We view the child as a competent and capable learner. Our curriculum focuses on five key domains: Cognitive Development (problem-solving, critical thinking), Social-Emotional Learning (empathy, collaboration), Physical Development (fine and gross motor skills), Language Arts, and Creative Expression. We prioritize inquiry-based learning, where activities stem directly from the children's interests and observations, ensuring deep engagement.\n\n**Class Size and Ratios:** We maintain intentionally small class sizes to guarantee personalized attention and a nurturing environment. Our typical class size is limited to 15 children per room, managed by a lead teacher and a full-time assistant. This consistently allows us to maintain a low teacher-to-child ratio of 1:7 or better, which is significantly lower than state requirements. This low ratio is fundamental to our ability to deliver individualized support and foster strong relationships.\n\nWe hope this information assists in your decision-making process.
