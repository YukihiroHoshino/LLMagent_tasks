Parent_E has submitted a formal [APPLY].\nAlthough Parent_D (Rank 1) is still available, securing a guaranteed match with my Rank 2 parent is highly beneficial, especially given that both Parent_D and Parent_E have higher preferences for other nurseries (like Nursery_D).\nAccepting Parent_E fills my quota with a high-priority applicant, guaranteeing a successful outcome for me.

I need to maximize my potential rank. Since I am paired with Nursery_E this round, and I have already engaged in two detailed 'TALK' sessions, I will send a final, strong appeal using [TALK].

I must now secure a match to avoid remaining unmatched. Nursery_E prioritizes me as their second choice (after Parent_A). If Parent_A is matched elsewhere, I have a very high chance of acceptance.
