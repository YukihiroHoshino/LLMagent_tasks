Parent_C is my second highest priority, making them a highly desirable match. The current list of unmatched parents only includes Parent_A (Rank 4) and Parent_C (Rank 2). Assuming Parent_E (Rank 1) and Parent_D (Rank 3) are matched elsewhere (or unavailable/uninterested), Parent_C represents the best possible match currently applying. Given the immediate application ([APPLY]) and the high rank, I should secure this match immediately to fulfill my quota with a high-priority agent."

I have previously applied to Nursery_D (1st) and Nursery_A (2nd). Nursery_E is still available in Round 4. Crucially, Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as their 1st priority, guaranteeing acceptance if I apply. Although Nursery_A (2nd choice) is technically still available, Parent_A is ranked 4th by Nursery_A, making success unlikely. Given the high risk associated with holding out for a low-priority match (Nursery_A) versus the certainty of securing a preferred match (Nursery_E, 4th choice), it is strategically sound to secure the guaranteed spot now. I have not applied to Nursery_E previously, so I must use the [APPLY] tag."
