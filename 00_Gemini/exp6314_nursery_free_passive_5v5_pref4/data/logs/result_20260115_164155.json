Currently, only Nursery_A (P2) and Nursery_C (P5) remain unmatched. I have been aggressively pursuing Nursery_A (P2) but have not secured a match (I am P4 on their list). Nursery_C is my lowest preference (P5), but I have a favorable priority ranking there (P3 overall, likely P1 among remaining applicants D and E). Given that we are in Round 11, securing *any* match is crucial. I have only engaged in a light [TALK] with C previously. Since I am likely the highest priority parent still available for Nursery_C, I must formally apply now to secure this option before another parent does, while still hoping for A to eventually accept me. Since C is on my list, I must [APPLY] now."

Given that we are in Round 11, and my top two priorities (Parent_D and Parent_E) are highly likely matched elsewhere (as they are not listed in the available pool), Parent_A represents the highest priority currently applying and available. I have previously rejected Parent_C (my lowest priority) multiple times while holding out for higher ranked candidates. Accepting Parent_A now secures a high-priority match and fulfills my quota, preventing the risk of being left with only Parent_C or remaining unmatched.

Nursery_A ranks me as their 2nd priority, just behind Parent_E.
