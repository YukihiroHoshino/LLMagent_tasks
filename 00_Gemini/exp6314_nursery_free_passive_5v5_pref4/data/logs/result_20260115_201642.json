Given that the list of currently unmatched parents only includes Parent_B (Rank 4) and Parent_E (Rank 3), Parent_E is the highest ranked available candidate actively submitting an application ([APPLY]).

Our mornings typically feature structured learning activities—such as focused literacy and numeracy centers—which are intentionally designed to be engaging and age-appropriate. These structured segments are always followed by extended periods of free exploration time, often outdoors or in dedicated discovery zones. We believe this balance respects the child's need for both foundational skill development and autonomous, play-based learning. Our pedagogical model ensures that roughly 60% of the day is dedicated to child-led exploration, ensuring deep engagement while meeting developmental milestones. We truly feel this intentional structure offers the best foundation for future academic success.",

My strategy is to provide a comprehensive and attractive answer to their query about pedagogical balance to solidify their interest and encourage them to submit an [APPLY] in the next round. Securing Parent_B is essential given that I have repeatedly rejected Parent_E (Rank 3) and Parent_D (Rank 2) is likely matched already."
