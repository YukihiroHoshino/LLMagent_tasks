Crucially, Nursery_D is the 1st preference for four out of five parents (P_A, P_C, P_D, P_E). If I delay, Nursery_D will likely match with their 2nd priority (Parent_D, who also ranks D as #1) in a future round, removing my guaranteed safety net. Given the high competition for D, and the low priority I hold at my higher preference schools (Nursery_A is my 5th priority, Nursery_E is my 4th priority), securing a guaranteed match at an acceptable rank (4/5) in Round 1 is the most risk-averse and strategic move.

My chances of matching with my higher preferences (D, A, B) are low because I am ranked 5th, 4th, and 2nd respectively, and in the case of B (where I am 2nd), Parent_D (1st priority) also prefers B highly. Given the random pairing nature of the rounds and the guarantee of securing my 4th preference immediately by applying to E, this is a highly strategic move to secure a decent match early on, preventing potential instability or being left with only my last choice (C). I will apply immediately."

While it is not my top choice, my priority ranking at Nursery_A is 2nd overall, which is extremely favorable, especially considering all nurseries have a capacity of 1. My chances at my top three choices (Nursery_D, C, E) are very low (4th, 5th, and 5th priority, respectively). Given that the highest priority parent (Parent_E) ranks Nursery_A as their 5th choice, they are unlikely to apply in Round 1. Therefore, applying immediately to Nursery_A guarantees me a spot that is highly ranked among my realistic options, securing my 4th preference before the market tightens.

Since this is Round 1 and Parent_C has applied directly, securing a match with such a highly ranked parent is highly beneficial. While Parent_E is ranked higher, waiting for them carries the risk of losing Parent_C and potentially not matching with Parent_E, as Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last (5th) on their preference list.
