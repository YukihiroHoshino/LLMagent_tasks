Regarding parent feedback, our recent internal survey highlighted exceptional satisfaction with our communication frequency and the individualized attention provided to each child. We consistently receive praise for the dedication of our teaching staff. As for curriculum enhancements for the new term, we are integrating a specialized 'Creative Problem Solving' module into our daily activities, designed to further develop critical thinking skills through play-based challenges. We believe this enhancement will perfectly complement our existing rigorous framework. We are very eager to welcome your family and encourage you to move forward with your application soon, as spaces are highly competitive.",

Since Parent_D sent a [TALK] message indicating continued interest and requesting specific information (parent feedback and curriculum), the immediate action must be [TALK]. My goal is to appeal actively to convert this strong interest into an application, while still holding out for the higher-ranked Parent_E (Rank 1) or Parent_C (Rank 2) if they decide to apply first. I will provide detailed, encouraging answers to their questions to solidify our position."
