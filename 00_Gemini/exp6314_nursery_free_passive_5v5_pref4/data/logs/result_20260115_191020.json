We formally [ACCEPT] your application and look forward to welcoming you to the Nursery A community!",

Parent_C has finally submitted a formal application [APPLY] after several rounds of conversation where I actively encouraged them to apply due to my high regard for them. Although Parent_E (Rank 1) is higher, they have not applied. Given that Parent_C ranks Nursery_A 4th, rejecting this application now would be highly risky, likely leading them to secure a spot at one of their higher-ranked choices (D, C, or E). Securing a Rank 2 match immediately is an excellent outcome. I will accept the application."
