Nursery_A is my 4th choice. My top choice, Nursery_D, ranks me 2nd in priority, giving me a strong chance there.

Furthermore, Nursery_A ranks me 3rd overall (behind Parent_E and Parent_C), so an application might not even succeed.

Since Parent_C has formally submitted an [APPLY], securing this match is a highly favorable outcome, ensuring I fill my quota with a high-priority parent. I will accept the application immediately."

The current market situation suggests that only Nursery_A (2nd choice) and Nursery_C (5th choice) remain available, implying that my top choices D, B, and E have been matched. I must secure one of the remaining spots. I have already applied to Nursery_A but have not received a definitive acceptance, making it uncertain. For Nursery_C, my priority ranking is 3rd (behind Parent_D and Parent_E). If Parent_D and Parent_E have secured spots elsewhere (which is likely if D, B, and E nurseries are matched), I am now the highest available parent for Nursery_C. Given the high risk of remaining unmatched if I hold out only for A, it is prudent to secure my last-preference match now. I will submit a formal application to Nursery_C."
