However, the current interaction is with Nursery_A.\n\nGiven that I am paired with Nursery_A, and it is my 4th choice but still on my list, I should secure it if possible, as the market is tightening. If I apply to A and get accepted, I secure a match, which is better than being unmatched.\n\nCrucially, Parent_C is ranked 2nd at Nursery_A, giving me excellent odds of acceptance.\n\nSince I have already applied to D and C in previous rounds without matching, and A is a viable option that ranks me highly, I should apply now to secure a spot before others do, especially since D and E are gone.
