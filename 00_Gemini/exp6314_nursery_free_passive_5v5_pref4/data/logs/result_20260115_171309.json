Given the intense demand and our commitment to maintaining the 1:8 ratio, allocation decisions are made swiftly upon receipt of an application, often within 24 hours, to secure the limited places.

Since I have a full quota available (1) and Parent_E is my ideal match, I must answer their question clearly while applying maximum pressure to encourage an immediate application in the next round.

Nursery_A is my 4th preference, but it is still preferred over Nursery_B and remaining unmatched.\n\nMarket Context: Only Nursery_A (P4) and Nursery_C (P2) remain unmatched. I have previously aggressively pursued Nursery_C, but Nursery_C ranks me last (P5). It is highly probable they are waiting for or have matched with a higher priority parent (D, E, A, or B).\n\nNursery_A's Priority: Nursery_A ranks Parent_C as their 2nd highest priority, after Parent_E. Given that we are in Round 5, it is likely that Parent_E has already matched, making me the de facto top choice for Nursery_A. \n\nStrategy: While Nursery_C is preferred, the low priority makes a match highly unlikely. Nursery_A is a viable, high-certainty match (P4 on my list). Securing a P4 match now is safer than risking being left with only Nursery_B or unmatched, especially since I have not formally applied to Nursery_A yet. I will submit a formal application."
