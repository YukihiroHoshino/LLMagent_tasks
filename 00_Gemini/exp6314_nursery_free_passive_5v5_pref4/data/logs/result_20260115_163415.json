Since the provided list suggests that Nursery_A is the only school remaining unmatched, and given my high priority ranking, this is the optimal time to secure a match before Parent_E applies or before Nursery_A is matched by another parent. I will make a formal application [APPLY]."

Parent_C is ranked 2nd on my priority list (['Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B']). My top choice, Parent_E, ranks me last on their list, making a match highly improbable. Parent_C has formally applied. Accepting Parent_C now secures an excellent match (P2) and completes my allocation goal early in the simulation, minimizing the risk of settling for a lower-ranked parent later. I will accept the application."
