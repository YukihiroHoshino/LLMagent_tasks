This gives me a very high chance of acceptance (likely only blocked by Parent_E if they apply). I have already engaged in two rounds of positive conversation with Nursery_A, expressing strong alignment. Given that the market is progressing (Round 4) and I have a high-priority position here, securing this match now is a strong strategic move to prevent being unmatched, even if D, C, and E were higher preferences. I will proceed with a formal application."
