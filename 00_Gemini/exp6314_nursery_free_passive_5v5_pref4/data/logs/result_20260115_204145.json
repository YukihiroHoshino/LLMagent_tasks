Nursery_E ranks me 3rd on their priority list: ['Parent_A', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C']. The two parents ranked above me (Parent_A and Parent_D) rank Nursery_E very low (4th and 5th, respectively), meaning they are likely applying to their top choices (likely Nursery_D or others). This gives me a strong chance to secure an acceptance here in Round 1, preventing me from falling to lower choices later. Given that my top choice (Nursery_D) is likely to accept Parent_D (who ranks N_D 1st and is N_D's 2nd priority), securing my 2nd choice now is optimal."

I am also the top priority for Nursery_B, giving me a strong chance there if paired later. Applying now to C closes off my pursuit of D and B. I will leverage my high priority status at C by using [TALK] to signal strong interest and keep the option alive, while preserving flexibility to apply to my higher ranked choices (D or B) if paired with them in subsequent rounds. If C matches with Parent_E (their #2 priority) before I return, I lose C, but this is a necessary risk to pursue higher preferences."
