Each student has measurable goals reviewed weekly by their lead teacher. We dedicate a specific block of time each morning for targeted interventions or enrichment tailored precisely to the child's current developmental stage, ensuring every child is learning at their optimal pace, not just the group's average.\n\n2. **Continuous Communication:** We ensure transparency through a multi-faceted approach. You receive daily digital journals detailing activities and key learning moments. Furthermore, we provide bi-weekly individualized progress reports focusing on PLP milestones, followed by scheduled quarterly parent-teacher conferences. We maintain an open-door policy and utilize secure messaging for real-time updates. We are committed to making you an active partner in your child's educational journey. \n\nWe feel a strong alignment with your family's values.

I previously sent an [APPLY] which likely resulted in a rejection or deferral, as I am still unmatched and Nursery_A is still available. Given my low priority (4th) on Nursery_A's list, I need to be persistent and force a decision. Since it is Round 6, time is critical.

Given that we are in Round 7 and I need to secure a match, applying to Nursery_C is a prudent defensive move. I am ranked 3rd at Nursery_C, which gives me a decent chance, especially if the top two parents (D and E) have already matched elsewhere. I have only engaged in 'TALK' previously with C, so this will be my first formal application to them.

Since I have only [TALKed] with A before, I must now formally apply to secure this option, especially since C is proving unattainable.
