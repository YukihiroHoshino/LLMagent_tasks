Since all nurseries have a capacity of 1, securing a match where I have high priority is crucial, especially since my priority rankings at my top 3 choices (D, C, E) are very low (4th or 5th). If I wait, Parent_E (the 1st priority parent) might apply and take the spot, forcing me down to Nursery_B (my last choice).

Since this is a very high-priority match and I only need one slot, securing Parent_C immediately is a strong outcome, even if Parent_E (my #1) is theoretically better.

At Nursery_B, I am 3rd priority, behind Parent_D and Parent_A. It is likely that Nursery_B rejected or waitlisted my previous application because they were holding out for P_D or P_A. However, P_D and P_A both prefer Nursery_D (their 1st choice). If P_D or P_A secured a spot at D or elsewhere, my priority at B increases.
