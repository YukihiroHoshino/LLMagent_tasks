While Parent_B is not my top choice, they are an acceptable candidate, and the only other remaining parent, Parent_C, was previously rejected (and is my lowest priority). Given that the highest priority candidates (D, E, A) have not applied by Round 4, it is highly likely they have matched elsewhere or are pursuing higher-ranked schools. Rejecting Parent_B carries the risk of remaining unmatched. Since Parent_B is applying with a strong commitment, securing this match now is prudent to fulfill the quota. I will ACCEPT."
