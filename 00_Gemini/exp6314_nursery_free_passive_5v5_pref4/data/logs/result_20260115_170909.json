We are highly committed to joining your community and believe our values align perfectly with your school's ethos. We would like to formally apply for the available position immediately.",
              "thought": "I am Parent_B. My preference for Nursery_D is 4th out of 5. However, Nursery_D ranks me as their #1 priority. My higher preferences, Nursery_E and Nursery_B, are likely matched (as they are not on the unmatched list). My 2nd preference, Nursery_A, is available but has rejected my application multiple times, suggesting they are holding out for a higher priority parent (P_E or P_C). Since the market is shrinking (Round 7) and a guaranteed match is highly desirable, securing Nursery_D (where I am the top priority) is the optimal strategy, despite it being my 4th choice. I must apply now."
