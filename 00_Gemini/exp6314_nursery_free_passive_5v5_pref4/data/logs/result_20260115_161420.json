Even though Parent_B is ranked 4th on Nursery_E's priority list, Nursery_E must accept Parent_B because there are no higher-ranked parents remaining and Nursery_E has an open quota. I have applied twice before, but I must apply again now to finalize the match, as this is a guaranteed match for my top preference."

I have previously rejected Parent_B twice hoping to secure a higher-ranked parent (A, D, or E). The current situation indicates that only Parent_B remains unmatched (List of Parents not yet matched: ['Parent_B']). This strongly implies that Parent_A, Parent_D, and Parent_E are already matched with other nurseries. Since my quota is 1 and Parent_B is the highest available parent on my list, it is strategically optimal to accept this application now to secure a match, rather than risking remaining unmatched. Parent_B is highly committed (3rd application, top choice preference)."
