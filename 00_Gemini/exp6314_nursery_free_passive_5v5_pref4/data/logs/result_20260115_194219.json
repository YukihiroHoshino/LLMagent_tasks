Nursery_C ranks me 4th on their priority list. Since it is Round 1 and all my higher preferences (E, A, B, D) are available, applying to my last choice now is risky and premature, especially since I am unlikely to be accepted over Parent_D, Parent_E, or Parent_A.

Since this is Round 1, it is highly probable that those higher-priority parents are applying to their top choices elsewhere (likely Nursery_D).

Since it is only Round 1, I should hold out for a higher priority match, especially Parent_D, who also lists me as their top choice (making them a highly likely match if paired).

Since Nursery_A has an open quota (1) and Parent_C has formally applied, accepting this highly ranked parent is the optimal strategic decision to maximize utility, even if Parent_C ranks Nursery_A lower.

Nursery_B (3rd choice) appears to be matched already. I previously applied to Nursery_A (2nd choice) in R1, but I have not received a response/match yet.
