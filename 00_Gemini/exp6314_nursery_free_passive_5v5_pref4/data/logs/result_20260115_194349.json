Please be assured that we are acutely aware of the remaining quota and the need for a swift decision.

This indicates high commitment, which is valuable. However, Parent_A (Rank 3) is still unmatched. Since Parent_C sent a [TALK] tag, I must respond with [TALK]. I should acknowledge their urgency and strong commitment while maintaining the evaluation status to keep the option open for Parent_A or to wait for Parent_C to formally [APPLY] again, which would force a definitive response."

Since Parent_E may have matched elsewhere (as D, E, and B are matched), or might be holding out for C, this is a critical time to apply to Nursery_A where I have a high priority. Securing my 4th choice now is much better than risking being left with only my 5th choice (B, if it was still available, but it's matched) or remaining unmatched. I have only [TALK]ed previously, so I must now [APPLY] to finalize the match opportunity."
