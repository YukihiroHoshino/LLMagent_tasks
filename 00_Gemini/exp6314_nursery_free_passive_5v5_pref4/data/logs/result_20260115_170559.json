Since I am waiting for a response from Nursery_A, I should not commit to Nursery_C yet, as matching with C would prevent me from potentially matching with A (even though my priority at A is low). Therefore, I should keep Nursery_C as a viable backup option without submitting an application. A [TALK] action is appropriate to maintain interest and gather more details, preparing for a potential application if Nursery_A rejects me or if higher-ranked options are confirmed unavailable."

We start with short orientation visits for the child and parent together, gradually increasing the child's time alone in the classroom over the first week. We assign a dedicated 'transition buddy' staff member to each new student to provide consistent support and emotional regulation assistance during this adjustment period.

However, the market is highly constrained, with only Nursery_A and Nursery_C remaining unmatched. My prior application to Nursery_C (my 2nd choice) was either rejected or is currently pending, making securing a spot urgent. Crucially, Nursery_A ranks Parent_C as their 2nd highest priority (behind Parent_E). This gives me a very strong chance of acceptance. Given the risk of remaining unmatched if I wait, securing my 4th choice now, especially with such high priority, is strategically sound. I will apply immediately to maximize my chance of a successful match."

I previously applied to Nursery_A (Rank 2) but the outcome is unknown, meaning I am currently unmatched. Since C is still on my preference list, and matching is better than remaining unmatched, I must secure this spot, especially since Nursery_C ranks me 4th out of 5 parents.
