Since Parent_B initiated [TALK], I must respond with [TALK].

Since we are in Round 4 and Parent_A needs a strong safety net, applying now to Nursery_B is strategic. If Parent_D has already matched elsewhere, Parent_A becomes the top priority and will likely be accepted. Even if Parent_D applies, Parent_A is still a strong contender if Parent_D is rejected elsewhere. Securing a match at P3 is better than risking being left with only P4 or P5 options."
