Parent_C is my second highest priority applicant. Since only Parent_A and Parent_C remain unmatched, and assuming my higher priority parents (Parent_E and Parent_D) are no longer available (matched elsewhere), Parent_C represents the highest achievable match for my remaining quota. Parent_C has applied and stated immediate acceptance. I must secure this highly ranked match now. Therefore, I will accept Parent_C."
