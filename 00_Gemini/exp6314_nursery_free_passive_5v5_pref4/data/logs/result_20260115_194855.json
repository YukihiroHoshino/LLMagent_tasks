Crucially, Nursery_E ranks Parent_A as their #1 priority ('Parent_A', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C'). Given that my higher preferences (Nursery_D, Nursery_B) are likely matched, and Nursery_A (2nd preference) has repeatedly rejected me (I am ranked #4 there), securing a match with Nursery_E is highly strategic. Since I have only engaged in [TALK] previously, I will now formally [APPLY] to leverage my top priority status at Nursery_E and secure a spot before the process concludes, maximizing my utility at rank 4."
