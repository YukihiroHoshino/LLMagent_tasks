Given that Parent_E ranks Nursery_A last (5th), securing Parent_C (who ranks N_A 4th) would be an excellent match, especially since I only have one quota. Parent_C initiated a [TALK] exchange asking about mid-year transitions, indicating serious intent despite N_A not being their top choice. I must provide a reassuring and appealing response to move them toward an [APPLY] action, while maintaining a sense of urgency about the limited availability."

Since the current status lists only Nursery_A as unmatched, I must assume my higher preferences (D, C, E) are already taken by other parents or matched in previous rounds. Therefore, Nursery_A is now my highest available option. Furthermore, Nursery_A ranks Parent_C 2nd overall, making an acceptance highly probable. Given the high priority and the urgency (likely the last spot available for me), I must formally apply now to secure the match."

Parent_C has formally submitted an [APPLY] action, indicating they are fully committed. Since I have not yet secured any match and Parent_C is a highly desirable candidate, accepting this application guarantees a successful, high-priority match and fills my quota immediately. Although Parent_E (Rank 1) is still available, securing Rank 2 is excellent, and waiting risks losing both."
