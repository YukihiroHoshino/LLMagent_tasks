Parent_C has proactively sent an [APPLY] request. Given the high priority of Parent_C and the high risk associated with holding out for Parent_E (who has low preference for us and has not applied), securing this high-ranked match is the best strategy to maximize utility and fulfill the quota reliably.

The current market situation indicates that only Nursery_A and Nursery_C remain unmatched, suggesting my top two choices (D and E) are likely matched elsewhere. Therefore, Nursery_C is now my highest available priority. Nursery_C ranks me (Parent_E) as their 2nd priority, right after Parent_D. Since it is Round 4 and the market is closing, and I am highly ranked by Nursery_C, I must apply immediately to secure a match, as waiting might allow Parent_D (if still unmatched) or another highly preferred parent to apply and potentially take the spot if Parent_D is matched elsewhere."
