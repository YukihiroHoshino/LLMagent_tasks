Critically, I am ranked 1st by Nursery_C.

However, I am ranked last (5th) on Nursery_A's priority list. Given my low priority, a second aggressive [APPLY] might lead to a quick rejection if higher-ranked parents are still active. Since Nursery_A is still unmatched, they are likely waiting for higher-priority candidates (P_E, P_C, P_D, P_A). I need to maintain strong interest without forcing their hand. Using [TALK] allows me to reiterate commitment and inquire about the process, keeping my application alive and signaling that I am a patient and committed backup option."
