We were very impressed with your family's alignment with our values. We are delighted to inform you that we are pleased to offer you the remaining placement at Nursery_C for the upcoming cycle.",

Parent_B is the 4th priority on Nursery_C's list ['Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_A', 'Parent_B', 'Parent_C']. According to the provided current situation, Parent_B is the only Parent not yet matched. This implies that Nursery_C's higher priorities (Parent_D, Parent_E, Parent_A) have already secured matches elsewhere. Since Parent_B is the highest available applicant and Nursery_C needs to fulfill its quota, accepting this application is the optimal strategic move to secure a match."
