Creative problem-solving is fostered through collaborative project work where children must negotiate roles and find solutions to shared challenges. Our role is to facilitate this process by asking guiding questions rather than providing direct answers, which builds true independence and resilience. Are there specific types of projects or activities your child particularly enjoys?",
