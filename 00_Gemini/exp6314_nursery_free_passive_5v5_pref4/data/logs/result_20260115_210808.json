While it is low on my list, securing a match is important. Crucially, Nursery_D's priority list places Parent_B first: ['Parent_B', 'Parent_D', 'Parent_E', 'Parent_C', 'Parent_A']. Since I am Nursery_D's top priority, applying now guarantees a match. Although Nursery_A (my 2nd choice) is still available, my chances there are poor (I am their 5th priority). Securing a guaranteed placement at my 4th choice (Nursery_D) is a safer strategy than risking being unmatched or settling for my 5th choice (Nursery_C) later. I will proceed with a formal application."

Since D is still unmatched, my application there might still be active, or I might be rejected soon. I need to keep my options open for D, C, and E, while securing a good standing with A.
