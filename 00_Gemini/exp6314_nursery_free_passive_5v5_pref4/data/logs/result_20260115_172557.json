Since this is Round 1 and I have not yet applied to my preferred nurseries (D, B, C, A), matching with Nursery_E now, even though I am ranked favorably (2nd) there, would be premature and suboptimal, locking me out of better options.

Although I rank extremely low (5th) on Nursery_C's priority list, it is crucial to secure a highly preferred spot early on.
