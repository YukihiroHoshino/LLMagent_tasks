Since Nursery_D (Parent_D's 1st choice) is likely already matched (as C, E, A remain), Parent_D may already be out of the market or prioritizing Nursery_B (their 2nd choice, also likely matched). This means Parent_E is likely the highest remaining priority for Nursery_C. Given this strong position and the high preference ranking, I must apply immediately to secure the match before other parents apply or before Nursery_C is randomly paired with a lower priority parent who might apply first."
