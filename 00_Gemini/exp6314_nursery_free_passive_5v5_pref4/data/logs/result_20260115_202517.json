Parent_C is my second highest priority. Given that Parent_E (Rank 1) is not available in the current unmatched pool (implied to be matched elsewhere, along with Parent_D and Parent_B), Parent_C is now the highest available parent seeking a spot. Securing a match with my second highest priority early in the process (Round 8, but still early in terms of securing a high-rank match) is highly advantageous. I will accept Parent_C immediately."
