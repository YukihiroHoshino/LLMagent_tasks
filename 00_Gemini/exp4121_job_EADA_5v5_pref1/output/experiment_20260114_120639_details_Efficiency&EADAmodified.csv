A key property of the DA algorithm when the proposing side (Seekers) proposes is that submitting truthful preferences is a weakly dominant strategy for the proposers to achieve their best stable match. 

1. Initial Simulation (Truthful Submission): If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_A proposes to Company_B (Rank 1). Since all seekers propose to their unique Rank 1 choices, and Company priorities are consistent (Seeker_A is preferred by all companies), the matching stabilizes immediately in Round 1 with M = {(A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}. Seeker_A achieves their Rank 1 choice (Company_B).

2. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2): Since the temporary admissions equal the final admissions in M, no seeker meets the 'Discrepancy' condition for being a blocking seeker. Part 2 does not rerun the algorithm, and the outcome remains M.

    * S_A applies to C_B. S_B applies to C_A. S_C applies to C_C. S_D applies to C_D. S_E applies to C_E.
    * In Round 1, all companies receive exactly one application. All seekers are temporarily admitted to their #1 choice.
    * The process ends immediately, resulting in a stable match where S_C gets Company_C (Rank 1).

2. Evaluate the Part 2 mechanism:
    * Part 2 only applies if a seeker was temporarily admitted (causing a rejection) but then ended up elsewhere (T != F).
    * Since the matching ended in Round 1 with no rejections, no seeker is a 'blocking seeker.' The outcome is final.

In general, the DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Job Seekers), meaning submitting the true preference list guarantees the seeker their best possible stable match. 

1. Initial DA Simulation (Assuming truthful reporting by all):
   My true preferences are D > A > C > B > E. My priority (Seeker_D) is 4th (P4), lower than S_A (P1), S_B (P2), and S_C (P3).
   - C_B, C_A, and C_C are quickly claimed by the higher priority seekers S_A, S_B, and S_C based on their high rank proposals (S_A gets C_B, S_B gets C_A, S_C gets C_C initially).
   - My Rank 1 choice, C_D, initially accepts me (S_D, P4) but later rejects me in favor of S_C (P3), as S_C proposes to C_D (Rank 4 for S_C) after being rejected by C_C, C_B, and C_A. S_C eventually matches with C_D.
   - I am forced down my list until I propose to C_E (Rank 5). C_E holds S_E (P5). Since I have higher priority (P4), C_E accepts me, resulting in a final match of S_D -> C_E.

2. Stability and Part 2:
   The resulting match (M: S_A->C_B, S_B->C_A, S_C->C_D, S_D->C_E) is the unique stable matching in this market. Since the outcome is stable, and I cannot form a blocking pair with any company I prefer over C_E, C_E is the best outcome achievable for me. Furthermore, in the simulation, no seeker satisfies the definition of a 'blocking Job Seeker' (where temporary admission causes rejection but the seeker moves away), so Part 2 does not alter this result.

1. Target Company_E (1st choice): Seeker_A (highest priority) also applies to Company_E in Round 1 (A's 1st choice). Since A has higher priority than E, A will always be admitted by Company_E, and I will be rejected. Thus, Company_E is unattainable.
2. Target Company_B (2nd choice): In the standard Deferred Acceptance (DA) process (Part 1), if I submit true preferences, I first apply to Company_E and am rejected. In Round 2, I apply to Company_B. Company_B receives no applications in R1, so I am admitted in R2, securing my 2nd choice.
3. Stability and Strategy-Proofness: The mechanism described is essentially the Seeker-Proposing DA algorithm (Part 1), followed by a check for instability (Part 2). Since the DA algorithm is strategy-proof for the proposing side (Seekers), submitting true preferences guarantees the seeker-optimal stable match. Any deviation risks missing the opportunity for Company_B, as I might apply to a company (like A) where I am immediately rejected due to low priority, potentially delaying my application to B until B is already filled by another seeker (though in this specific simulation, B is available).

   - Round 1: All seekers apply to their Rank 1 choice. A->B, B->A, C->C, D->D, E->E.
   - Since all companies receive exactly one application, everyone is temporarily admitted to their Rank 1 choice.
   - Matching M = {A: B, B: A, C: C, D: D, E: E}. 

2. Stability and Outcome:
   - This matching is reached in Round 1 and is stable. Seeker_E matches with Company_E (Rank 1).

3. Mechanism Check:
   - Since the matching M was final after Part 1, there are no temporary admissions that differ from final admissions, meaning no blocking Job Seekers are identified in Part 2. The final outcome for Seeker_E is Company_E.

Since submitting my true preferences yields my Rank 1 choice, this is the optimal strategy. No strategic misrepresentation could improve this outcome.",True,Company_E,True,True,1

1. Market Simulation (using TPL): Seeker_A's 1st choice is Company_B. All companies prioritize Seeker_A highest (1st rank). In Round 1, Seeker_A proposes to Company_B. Since all other seekers propose to different companies (S_B->A, S_C->C, S_D->D, S_E->E), Company_B receives only one application (from Seeker_A) and temporarily admits Seeker_A. Since no rejections occurred, the process stops here.
2. Outcome: Seeker_A is matched with Company_B (1st choice).
3. Part 2 Check: Since the temporary admission equals the final admission for all seekers, the condition for a 'blocking Job Seeker' (Discrepancy) is never met. Part 2 does not alter the matching.

1.

Round 1:

- All companies receive exactly one application and accept. 
- M = {(A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

A key property of the DA algorithm is that for the proposing side (Job Seekers), submitting their true preferences is a dominant strategy, maximizing their outcome according to their preferences regardless of others' submissions. 

We simulate the outcome if all seekers submit their true preferences. Since Seeker_B is the second highest priority (P2) at all companies, Seeker_A (P1) is the main competitor.

1. Analysis of Competition for Top Choices: In the stable matching outcome (assuming everyone reports truthfully), Seekers A, B, C, and D all target and secure their respective Rank 1 or Rank 2 choices that are highly preferred by them and for which they have priority over me:
    - Company_B is Rank 1 for A (A > E priority).

2. Outcome with Truthful Reporting: If I report truthfully ([E, B, A, C, D]), I apply to E first. Since no other seeker lists E as their Rank 1 choice, I am admitted to Company_E immediately in Step 1 of Part 1. This secures my Rank 1 choice.

3. Strategic Deviation: If I deviate (e.g., apply to B first), I will be rejected by Company_B (as Seeker_A has priority and applies there first) and then apply to Company_E in the next step, resulting in the same Rank 1 match. 

4. Impact of Part 2 (Blocking Seekers): Since the stable matching is reached in the first step of Part 1 when reporting truthfully, no rejections occur, and thus the 'blocking seeker' mechanism of Part 2 is not triggered.

   Round 1 Applications (P1 choices):

Seeker D's True Preference List (TPL) is ['Company_D', 'Company_A', 'Company_C', 'Company_B', 'Company_E'].

Step 1 (All submit TPL):

1. Applications:
   - Seeker_A applies to Company_B.
   - Seeker_B applies to Company_A.
   - Seeker_C applies to Company_C.
   - Seeker_D applies to Company_D (1st choice).
   - Seeker_E applies to Company_E.

2. Admissions:
   - Company_A receives Seeker_B and admits B.
   - Company_B receives Seeker_A and admits A.
   - Company_C receives Seeker_C and admits C.
   - Company_D receives Seeker_D and admits D (since D is the only applicant).
   - Company_E receives Seeker_E and admits E.

Since no Job Seekers were rejected, the process ends immediately (Part 1). The resulting match is M = {(A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E)}.

Seeker_D is matched with Company_D, which is their 1st choice. Since this is the highest possible outcome, strategic misrepresentation is unnecessary and cannot improve the result. Furthermore, since the match was achieved in the first step without any rejections, there are no 'blocking Job Seekers' (Part 2 is irrelevant).

My goal is to maximize my outcome based on my True Preference List: ['Company_E', 'Company_B', 'Company_A', 'Company_C', 'Company_D'].

1. Market Analysis: If all seekers submit their true preferences, Seeker_E gets Company_E (Rank 1). However, this outcome is unstable because Seeker_A (highest priority) prefers Company_E (Rank 1) over their assigned company (Company_B, Rank 2), and Company_E prefers Seeker_A over Seeker_E. 
2. Strategic Prediction: Seeker_A has a clear incentive to deviate strategically and list Company_E first, securing their Rank 1 choice due to their high priority. I must assume Seeker_A will play optimally.
3. Outcome Prediction: If Seeker_A applies to Company_E, Seeker_E will be rejected by Company_E in the first round. Seeker_E will then apply to their second choice, Company_B. Since all other high-priority seekers (B, C, D) are matched with their respective Rank 1 choices (Company_A, Company_C, Company_D) in this scenario, Company_B will be available for Seeker_E. The final stable matching outcome for Seeker_E is Company_B (Rank 2).
4. Optimal Strategy: Since the underlying mechanism (Part 1) resembles the Seeker-Proposing Deferred Acceptance algorithm, which is strategy-proof for seekers, submitting the truthful preference list is the optimal strategy. Submitting the truthful list ensures that if, by chance, Company_E becomes available (i.e., Seeker_A fails to apply there), I capture it.

As Seeker_A, I hold the highest priority at every single Company (Company_A ranks A > B > C > D > E, and similarly for B, C, D, E). This makes me a highly desirable candidate.

If all seekers submit their true preferences, the matching process (Part 1) proceeds as follows:
1. A applies to B, B applies to A, C applies to C, D applies to D, E applies to E.
2. Since each company receives only one application, all seekers are immediately admitted to their rank 1 choice.
3. Final Matching (M1): (A, B), (B, A), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E).

Seeker_A is matched with Company_B, which is Rank 1 on my True Preference List. This is the optimal outcome.

Part 2 addresses 'blocking Job Seekers.' A blocking seeker is one whose temporary admission caused a rejection, but who later moved elsewhere (Discrepancy). In the scenario above, Part 1 ended in Step 1 with no rejections, so no blocking seekers are identified. The final matching remains (A, B).

1. Round 1: Seeker_A applies to Company_B. Seeker_B applies to Company_A.
2. Company_A receives only one application (from B) and provisionally admits B.
3. Since no agent is rejected in Round 1 (all 5 seekers apply to 5 different companies, and all are admitted), the process stops.

Outcome: I match with Company_A, which is my Rank 1 choice.

In this scenario, the matching is stable and achieved in Round 1, giving me (S_D) my Rank 1 choice, C_D. Since I achieve my highest preferred outcome, no strategic deviation can improve my position.

2. Analysis of Part 2 (Blocking Job Seekers):

The final match is (B, A), (A, B), (C, C), (D, D), (E, E). Seeker_B matches with Company_A, which is Seeker_B's Rank 1 choice.

3. Blocking Seeker Check (Part 2):
Since no rejections occurred in Part 1, the condition for a Job Seeker to be 'blocking' (Prevention: causing other Job Seekers to be rejected) is not met. Therefore, Part 2 does not lead to any changes.

4. Conclusion:
Submitting the true preference list yields the highest possible outcome (Rank 1 match).
